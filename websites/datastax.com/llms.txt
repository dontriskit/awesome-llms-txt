## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is Astra DB the right vector database for me?**
Astra DB combines industry-leading performance (20% higher relevance, 74x faster responses) with the enterprise reliability of Apache Cassandra. Its serverless architecture means zero management overhead and pay-only-for-what-you-use pricing. With MCP support, you can build AI applications through natural language rather than code, and the free tier makes getting started risk-free.

**Why is Langflow a great visual AI workflow builder?**
Langflow stands out as a visual IDE for AI by making complex LangChain workflows accessible through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. It eliminates the steep learning curve for building sophisticated AI pipelines, seamlessly integrates with Astra DB for vector storage, and allows you to export your visual designs as Python code. As an open-source tool, it offers both flexibility and community-driven innovation.

**What is a vector database?**
A vector database stores data as high-dimensional vectors, enabling similarity search for AI applications to find semantically similar content rather than just exact matches. They store embeddings, which are numerical representations of text, images, or other data created by machine learning models.

**What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**
MCP is a protocol that allows direct interaction between AI models and tools like databases. Astra DB supports MCP, enabling AI models to perform database operations directly through natural language without writing code.

**How can I get started with Astra DB?**
Sign up for a free account at [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com), create a database, and get your API endpoint and token. The free tier includes generous storage and operations for development and small applications.

**How does Astra DB compare to traditional databases for AI?**
Traditional databases lack vector search capabilities essential for semantic similarity. Astra DB was built to support both vector and traditional operations with a serverless architecture that's cost-effective for AI workloads with variable demand.

**What embedding models work with Astra DB?**
Astra DB works with all major embedding models including OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, and open-source models like BERT and sentence-transformers. Vector dimensions are configurable to match your chosen model.
