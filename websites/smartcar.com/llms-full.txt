# Make Specific Endpoints
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/about-brand-specific



In cases where there are many differences in how each OEM provides the same data, Smartcar will provide you with a make-specific endpoint before making it widely available to all supported makes. This allows our customers to start taking advantage of these endpoints and share feedback with Smartcar earlier.

These endpoints will maintain consistent behavior and will not "break" with future releases. In time, a make-specific endpoint might be standardized across various makes, eliminating the need to indicate the make in the URL. You won't need to modify your code but you might benefit from a newly standardized version.

<Info>When using make specific endpoints, please ensure to specify the make in lower case format. Using upper case letters will result in a PERMISSION error.</Info>

# API Errors
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/api-errors



Smartcar uses HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of API requests. This includes:

* `2XX`: indicates success
* `4XX`: indicates an invalid request (e.g. a required parameter is missing from the request body)
* `5XX`: indicates Smartcar-related issues (e.g. a vehicle is not capable of fulfilling a request).

## Error Response

All Smartcar errors contain the following fields:

# By VIN
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/compatibility/by-vin

GET /compatibility
Compatibility will vary by model, year, and trim. This API is for reference purposes only and it showcases vehicle makes and models that may be compatible with Smartcar and it does not guarantee that a specific vehicle will be compatible.

<Info>
  The Compatibility API is an Enterprise feature. Please [contact us](https://smartcar.com/pricing/) to upgrade your plan.
</Info>

Compatibility by VIN allows developers to determine if a specific vehicle could be compatible with Smartcar.

A vehicle is capable of a given feature if:

1. The vehicle supports the feature (e.g., a Ford Escape supports /fuel but a Mustang Mach-e does not)
2. Smartcar supports the feature for the vehicle's make

This endpoint only supports checking capabilities for vehicles sold in the United States. It **does not** support checking `capabilities` for VINs in Canada and Europe.

# Permissions
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/permissions

In order to use an endpoint or webhook, you'll need to request the associated permissions from your user in [Connect](/docs/connect/what-is-connect).

A permission is *optional* by default. This means that if you were to pass `read_fuel` in your Connect URL and the user tried to connect a Tesla, the permission would not show up as Tesla does not support fuel.

It can be made required by adding the `required:` prefix to the permission name, e.g. `required:read_fuel`. In this case, if a user were to try and connect a Tesla they'd see a `No Compatible Vehicles` Connect error as your
application is requiring vehicles to have the `read_fuel` permission.

<Info>
  In Europe, permissions can be conditional meaning that even if the `required:` prefix is provided, a vehicle can make it through Connect as we cannot be sure of a vehicle's capability until you attempt to make an API request.

  In this case you'll receive a [VEHICLE\_NOT\_CAPABLE](/errors/api-errors/compatibility-errors#vehicle-not-capable) API error. To read more about capabilities please see [Compatibility by VIN](/api-reference/compatibility/by-vin).
</Info>

## Read

Permissions prefixed with `read_` allow your application to get data from a vehicle as part of `GET` requests.

Note: A single user can own multiple vehicles, and multiple users can own the same vehicle.

<Info>
  When using Single Select for Connect, a single user with multiple vehicles
  will have a 1:1 (`access_token`:`vehicle_id`) mapping.
</Info>

<RequestExample>
  <Snippet file="api-reference/core-sdk-methods/user.mdx" />
</RequestExample>

## Response

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">

# Callback URI Verification
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/callback-verification

Verify your newly-created webhook.

<Info>
  This page covers the verification step **when first setting up a webhook** on Dashboard. Please see our [payload verification](/api-reference/webhooks/payload-verification) section for information on how to verify webhook payloads from vehicles.
</Info>

When you first set up a webhook in the Smartcar Dashboard, Smartcar will post a challenge request to ensure we're sending payloads to the correct place. This is a **one time** event and will be in the following format:

```json verificationRequest.body
    {
        "version": "2.0",
        "webhookId": "<uuid>",
        "eventName": "verify",
        "payload": { "challenge": "<random-string>" }
    }
```

Upon receiving the request, your server will need respond to the challenge by hashing `payload.challenge` with your `application_management_token` to create a `SHA-256` based `HMAC`.

<Tip>
  Our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks) have helper methods to generate the `HMAC`.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
      hmac = smartcar.hash_challenge(
              application_management_token, 
              payload.challenge
          )
  ```

  ```js Node
      let hmac = smartcar.hashChallenge(
          application_management_token, 
          payload.challenge
      ); 
  ```

  ```java Java
  String hmac =  Smartcar.hashChallenge(
              application_management_token, 
              payload.challenge
          );
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
      hmac = Smartcar.hash_challenge(
          application_management_token, 
          payload.challenge
      )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Return the hex-encoded hash as the value for `challenge` in your response body with a `200` status code, and the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.

```json verificationResponse.body
{
  "challenge" : "{HMAC}"
}
```


# Payload Verification
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/payload-verification



<Info>
  This page covers verification of payloads from vehicles.
  Please see our [callback verification](/api-reference/webhooks/callback-verification) section for
  information on how to initially verify your callback uri.
</Info>

Verify webhook payloads against the `SC-Signature` header and a `SHA-256` based `HMAC` generated by hashing
your `application_management_token` and the body.

<Tip>
  Our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks) have helper methods that return `true` if the payload is good.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
      Smartcar.verify_payload(
          {application_management_token},
          {SC-Signature}, 
          {webhook_body}
      )
  ```

  ```js Node
      smartcar.verify_payload(
          {application_management_token},
          {SC-Signature}, 
          {webhook_body}
      );
  ```

  ```java Java
      Smartcar.verifyPayload(
          {application_management_token},
          {SC-Signature}, 
          {webhook_body}
      );
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
      Smartcar.verify_payload(
          {application_management_token},
          {SC-Signature}, 
          {webhook_body}

a. Brand aliases in Brand Select such as VW for Volkswagen

b. Unavailable brands that we plan to introduce in the future, which will display a message highlighting future compatibility with the chosen brand.

2. Expanding login method coverage to include phone numbers for certain brands. We now allow users to log in using email or phone number for the Connect flow starting with Kia and Mercedes-Benz. Stay tuned to our changelog for more brand updates.
3. Providing clearer errors for the Connect flow:

a. no\_vehicles for when the user does not have any vehicles tied to their account and they click to go back to the application

b. configuration\_error for when exiting Connect back to your app through an error page (see below).

# Country Selection
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/advanced-config/country-flag

By default Connect will launch based on the devices location impacting the brands that are available to the user e.g. Renault is only available in Europe.

You can override this behaviour by passing a country feature flag in your Connect URL in the form `country:{country_code}`.

Your feature flag should contain the [two-character ISO country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
of the country that your user is located in.

<Tip>
  Our SDKs provide ways for you to add this as part of the the various `authUrlBuilder` or `getAuthUrl` methods.
</Tip>

```plaintext Connect URL w/ country feature flag
https://connect.smartcar.com/oauth/authorize?
response_type=code
&client_id=8229df9f-91a0-4ff0-a1ae-a1f38ee24d07
&scope=read_odometer read_vehicle_info
&redirect_uri=https://example.com/home
&flags=country:GB
```

Alternatively, your users can manually change their country and language on Connect's preamble screen:

<Frame caption="Country selector dropdown on the Preamble screen in Connect" type="simple">

# Connect Flows
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/advanced-config/flows

Connect can be launched with three different workflows. Depending on your use case and what information you have about the vehicle ahead of a launching Connect, you may be able to leverage one of these flows for a more streamlined Connect experience.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default" defaultOpen="true">
    When you launch Connect, users will be able to select the brand of their vehicle from a list before they enter their credentials and grant access to your application.

    <Frame caption="Default Smartcar Connect Flow">
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/default-connect-flow.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Authorizing a Single Vehicle">
    In some cases you may only want to connect to a single vehicle, even if there are more than one on your user's connected services account. Smartcar provides two ways for you to do this:

    * Single Select
    * Single Select with VIN

    ### Single Select

    Limits the user's selection on the permissions screen to a single car if there are multiple vehicles on their connected services account. Notice that check-boxes turn into radio buttons, and the call to action wording changes slightly.

    <Frame caption="Grant Screen - Single Select without VIN">
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/single-selection.png" />
    </Frame>

    To enable Single Select, you can pass `single_select=true` as URL parameter when launching Smartcar Connect.

    ### Single Select with VIN

    In addition, if you know the user’s VIN ahead of time you can pass this over to us in the connect URL. In doing so:

    1. Smartcar  decodes the VIN to get the brand and send the user to the appropriate login form directly
    2. If the owner has more than one vehicle on their connected services account, we’ll only show the VIN that was passed to us on the permission grant screen.

    <Frame caption="Single Select /w VIN: Preamble > Brand’s Login Form > Grant Screen  - no vehicle choice">
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/single-select.png" />
    </Frame>

    To enable Single Select with VIN, you can pass `single_select=true` and `single_select_vin=:vin` as URL parameters when launching Smartcar Connect.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bypassing the Brand Selection Screen">
    ### Brand Select

    Instead of having users go through the brand selector screen, you can pass us a brand in the Connect URL and send the user to the appropriate login form directly  .

    <Frame caption="Brand Select">
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/brand-select.png" />
    </Frame>

    To enable Brand Select, you can pass `make` as URL parameter when launching Connect. For example, `make=TESLA`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


# Modes
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/advanced-config/modes



<Tip>
  If no mode is specified, Connect will launch in `live` mode by default.
</Tip>

| Mode      | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| live      | Launches Connect in live mode allowing a user to login in with a real connected services account.                    |
| simulated | Launches Connect in simulated mode allowing developer to connect to vehicles created on Dashboard via the Simulator. |


# Auth Code Exchange
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/auth-code-exchange



To interact with the Smartcar API, you will need to exchange your authorization code for an access token. The authorization code represents a user’s consent, but cannot be used to make requests to a vehicle. Instead, it must be exchanged for an access token. An example request is provided to the right.

<Snippet file="authorization/auth-code-exchange.mdx" />


# SDKs for Connect
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/connect-sdks

Our SDKs make integrating Smartcar fast and easy in different languages and frameworks.

For mobile or single page web apps, you can use one of our frontend SDKs. Please note that our frontend SDKs only handle
integrating Connect into your application. You will still need to use a backend SDK to manage tokens and make API requests to vehicles.

<Snippet file="sdks/connect-sdk-card-group.mdx" />

For server-side rendered applications, you can use one of our backend SDKs:

<Snippet file="sdks/api-sdk-card-group.mdx" />

<br />

<Tip>
  Don't see an SDK for your language? No problem!
  As long as you can build a URL and handle http requests, you're good to go.
</Tip>


# Dashboard Configuration
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/dashboard-config



## Registration

To get started, register your application with Smartcar by navigating to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/login).

After registration, your application will be assigned a `CLIENT_ID` and a `CLIENT_SECRET`. The `CLIENT_SECRET` must be kept safe and used only in exchanges between your application’s server and Smartcar’s <Tooltip tip="https://connect.smartcar.com">authorization server</Tooltip>.

## Redirect URIs

To authorize with Smartcar, you’ll need to provide one or more redirect URIs. The user will be redirected to the specified URI upon authorization. On redirect, the URI will contain an authorization `code` query parameter that must be exchanged with Smartcar’s authorization server for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

The redirect URIs must match one of the following formats:

| Protocol       | Format                                                                                   | Example                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HTTP           | a localhost URI with protocol `http://`                                                  | `http://localhost:8000`                                                        |
| HTTPS          | a URI with protocol `https://`                                                           | `https://myapplication.com`                                                    |
| JavaScript SDK | `https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin={localhost-or-HTTPS-origin}` | `https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=https://myapp.com` |
| Custom-scheme  | `sc{clientId}://{hostname-with-optional-path-component-or-TLD}`                          | `sc4a1b01e5-0497-417c-a30e-6df6ba33ba46://callback`                            |

<Note>HTTP is allowed only for testing purposes on localhost</Note>

### Javascript SDK

The JavaScript SDK redirect is used along with the JavaScript SDK library. For more details and examples on the redirect usage, see the [SDK documentation](https://github.com/smartcar/javascript-sdk).

### Custom-scheme

Custom-scheme URIs are used for mobile applications. They must begin with `sc{clientId}` and can have an optional path or TLD. See the OAuth reference on redirect URIs.


# Handle the Response
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/handle-the-response

Upon successfully accepting the permissions, Smartcar will redirect the user back to your application using the specified `REDIRECT_URI`, along with an authorization code as a query parameter. In the case of on error, we'll provide an error and description as parameters instead.

# Redirect to Connect
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/re-auth/redirect-to-connect



There will be times when a user updates credentials to their connected services account. When this happens, the user will need to go through Connect
again to update your authorization through Smartcar.

You can do this with a streamlined Connect flow using a special re-auth URL with the parameters below.

<Tip>
  The [`AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`]() API error contains a partially constructed re-authentication URL in the `resolution.url` field.
</Tip>

<br />

<ParamField path="client_id" type="string" required>
  The application’s unique identifier.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="redirect_uri" type="string" required>
  The URI a user will be redirected to after authorization. This value **must** match one of the redirect URIs set in the credentials tab of the dashboard.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="response_type" type="string" required>
  This value must be set to `vehicle_id`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="vehicle_id" type="string" required>
  The id of the vehicle you are reauthenticating.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="state" type="string">
  An optional value included as a query parameter in the redirect\_uri back to your application. This value is often used to identify a user and/or prevent cross-site request forgery
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="user" type="string">
  Specify a unique identifier for the vehicle owner to track and aggregate analytics across Connect sessions for each vehicle owner on Dashboard.

  Note: Use the `state` parameter in order to identify the user at your callback URI when receiving an authorization or error code after the user exits the Connect flow.
</ParamField>

# Overview
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/token-management/overview

After fetching your first token pair, you'll need to manage them in order to maintain access to the vehicle.

## Storing access tokens

### Default and Brand Select Connect Flow

By default tokens are scoped to the user's connected services account.

<Note>This means that if there are multiple vehicles
on the account - and they are selected at the time of authorization, the access token is valid for all those vehicle Ids.</Note>

To manage this, we recommend using the [Smartcar User Id](/api-reference/management/user) to link tokens to your corresponding user id. The diagram below
will also allow multiple users to connect to vehicles on the same account.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/connect/StandardFlowDBDiagram.png" />
</Frame>

### Single Select Connect Flow

When using the Single Select flow, tokens are strictly scoped to the vehicle that was authorized for that Connect session.
This means that if a user connects multiple vehicles under the same connected services account, each vehicle id will be tied
to its own set of tokens.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/connect/ConnectMatchDBDiagram.png" />
</Frame>

## Token expiry

Access tokens are valid for 2 hours, while refresh tokens are valid for 60 days. You can use the corresponding refresh token to fetch a new token pair
once an access token has expired.

In order to maintain access to a vehicle without having a user go through Connect again, you'll want to make sure the refresh token never expires.
Whenever you fetch a new token pair, we will return a **new access and refresh token**.

Prior to expiry, access tokens will remain valid until their expiry when fetching a new token pair. Refresh tokens on the other hand are invalidated
1 minute after they're used.

To avoid common 401 Authentication errors, please ensure you are **persisting both the access and refresh token** we return whenever you fetch a new pair.

<Tip>
  In addition to any logic that checks access token expiry when making an API request, we strongly recommend having another job that periodically
  checks for refresh tokens that are close to expiry and refreshes them.
</Tip>


# Refreshing Refresh Tokens
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/token-management/refresh-refresh-token

Refresh tokens expire after **60 days ordinarily** or **after 1 minute when used to fetch a new token pair**.

Depending on your application logic, there may be cases where you don't end up fetching a fresh access token for more than 60 days.
If this is the case, you should fetch a new token pair before the 60 days are up so the user doesn’t need to go through Connect again.

This will give you a newly minted access token **and** refresh token.

<Snippet file="authorization/token-exchange.mdx" />


# Refreshing Access Tokens
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/token-management/refreshing-access-token

Your access token will expire **2 hours** after it is issued. When this happens, your application  can retrieve a new one by using the corresponding `REFRESH_TOKEN`.

<Snippet file="authorization/token-exchange.mdx" />


# What is Connect?
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/what-is-connect



Smartcar Connect is the fastest and most transparent way to collect user consent. Before you can make API requests to a car, your customer needs to link the vehicle to your app. It’s a simple process for your users to enroll their vehicles:

1. Select the car brand
2. Sign in
3. Give consent

<Frame caption="Default Smartcar Connect Flow">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/default-connect-flow.png" />
</Frame>

From your app, you'll [redirect your users to Connect](/connect/redirect-to-connect), and [handle the response](/connect/handle-the-response) once the user completes or exits the Connect flow. You'll receive a `code` that you'll use to [exchange](/connect/auth-code-exchange) for an access token to start making requests to their vehicle(s).

We have designed Connect in compliance with the OAuth2 authorization protocol, safely handling all user information.

Connect comes with robust configurations to fit your needs and frontend [SDKs](/connect/connect-sdks) for faster integration.


# Authentication Errors
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/errors/api-errors/authentication-errors

Thrown when there is an issue with your authorization header.

# `NULL`

The authorization header is missing or malformed, or it contains invalid or expired authentication credentials (e.g. access token, client ID, client secret). Please check for missing parameters, spelling and casing mistakes, and other syntax issues.

```json

  "requestId": "5dea93a1-3f79-4246-90c5-89610a20471b",
  "resolution": { "type": null } 
}
```

### Suggested Resolution

You can resolve this error by referring to our API reference and ensuring that you pass all the parameters as specified. If you are certain that your request is well-formed, please try refreshing your access token.

### Troubleshooting Steps

Refer to our API reference and ensure that you use the correct authentication mechanism for your request

* Check constants like Bearer and Basic for spelling mistakes.
* If you make a request to a vehicle endpoint, verify that your access token grants you access to the correct vehicle. You can do so by making a request to the /vehicles endpoint and ensuring that the correct vehicle ID is included in the returned response.
* If you have refreshed your access token, make sure that it persists and that you use your new token to make your request.

```

On redirect, Connect will return the status code and message of the error that they encountered. This will be triggered if:

* A user tried to directly navigate to a page that is past their current step in Connect (ie. going directly from the Preamble screen to the Permission Grants screen by directly going to connect.smartcar.com/grant).
* A user is trying to use Single Select in live mode with a test mode VIN or with a simulated VIN in a non-simulated mode.
* A user is trying to use Single Select with an invalid mock VIN.
* A validation error occurs when trying to check compatibility by VIN.

These cases will trigger the following error and give the user the ability to “Exit” Connect.

# Vehicle Incompatible
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/errors/connect-errors/vehicle-incompatible

This error occurs when a user tries to authorize an incompatible vehicle in Smartcar Connect.

| Parameter           | Required | Description                           |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `error`             | `true`   | `vehicle_incompatible`                |
| `error_description` | `true`   | The user’s vehicle is not compatible. |
| `make`              | `false`  | The manufacturer of the vehicle.      |
| `vin`               | `false`  | The VIN of the vehicle.               |

In order to be compatible, a vehicle must:

* Have the hardware required for internet connectivity
* Belong to the makes and models Smartcar is compatible with
* Be capable of the required permissions that your application is requesting access to
* If the user’s vehicle is incompatible, Smartcar will let the user know and offer them to share their vehicle’s VIN, make, model, and year with your application.

This error is triggered when a user selects an unspported make, or selects "I don't see my brand..." and then hits "Back to application"

<Frame caption="Vehicle Incompatible">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/errors/connect-errors/vehicle-incompatible.png" />

# Connect Playground
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/dashboard/playground



Creating your Connect URL can be easily done through the Dashboard's new Playground feature.

Your Connect URL gives a path for vehicle owners to provide consent for requested data and/or commands. While this can be done following our [Build the Connect URL](https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/redirect-to-connect) guide, you can also build the URL through the Smartcar Dashboard.

With the Generated Connect URL preview, you can see how your adjustments change the vehicle-owner facing URL.

## 1. Basic Settings

<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/playground/playground-basic-settings.png" />
</Frame>

#### Client ID

Your Client ID will automatically populate for the selected Dashboard application.

#### Redirect URI

Select from one of your pre-existing Redirect URIs, or add it now.

#### Mode

Select from Live or [Simulated](https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/dashboard/simulator) mode.

## 2. Permissions

<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/playground/playground-permissions.png" />
</Frame>

In this step, select which permissions your application will request from the vehicle. This may include read access to data like odometer or location, or commands that may lock or unlock the vehicle.

</Frame>

### State

State is an optional value included as a query parameter in the `REDIRECT_URI` back to your application.

### User

Specify a unique identifier for the vehicle owner to track and aggregate analytics across Connect sessions for each vehicle owner on Dashboard.

Note: Use the `state` parameter in order to identify the user at your callback URI when receiving an authorization or error code after the user exits the Connect flow.

### Make

Allows users to bypass the Brand Selector screen. Valid `makes` can be found in the [makes](/api-reference/makes) section on API reference.

The `single_select_vin` parameter takes precedence over this parameter.

### Country

The two-character ISO country code of the country that your user is located in. You can set the default country for Connect on Dashboard

If no flag is passed or set as default on Dashboard, Smartcar will use the devices IP to set an appropriate country.

This flag determines what brands are listed on the Brand Selector screen in Connect e.g. Renault is available in Europe, but not the US.

### Vehicle Single Select

Sets the vehicle selection behavior of the grant dialog. If enabled, then the user is only allowed to select a single vehicle.


# Vehicle Simulator
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/dashboard/simulator



Before launching your integration, we recommend using Smartcar’s Vehicle Simulator to test your application on a simulated vehicle. With the Simulator, you can choose the vehicle's region, make, model and year as well as the vehicle state to test with. Watch your simulated vehicle travel in real-time from the Smartcar Dashboard as you test API requests from your application with realistic vehicle data responses.

<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/dashboard-simulator.png" />
</Frame>

## 1. Create a simulated vehicle

#### Create a simulated vehicle

Begin by logging into the Smartcar Dashboard and navigating to the Simulator tab. Choose your region and select a Smartcar-compatible vehicle using the Make, Model, and Year dropdowns. Or, use the VIN search feature to create a simulated vehicle of the same Make, Model and Year as the VIN entered, as long as the vehicle is compatible with Smartcar. Please note the VIN search is only available for US-based VINs at this time.

#### Review the vehicle capabilities

Confirm the vehicle's supported capabilities includes those you wish to test.

#### Select a vehicle state

Select from one of three available vehicle states for your simulated vehicle. The states vary in duration from 8 to 24 hours and include driving, charging, and parked vehicle states for a wide range of test scenarios.

## 2. Connect your app to the simulated vehicle

Once you've selected a vehicle and state, you are ready to connect the simulated vehicle to your application for testing.

Grab the simulated vehicle credentials
On the simulation screen, you will find a Connect Credentials button that will open a modal containing the simulated vehicle's credentials. You will need these to connect your app and vehicle using Smartcar Connect.

#### Launch Smartcar Connect in simulated mode

When launching Smartcar Connect, pass in the query parameter mode=simulated to enable simulated mode and ensure you can connect to your newly created simulated vehicle. Smartcar's SDKs provide a convenient option to facilitate this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Node
  const client = new smartcar.AuthClient({
    clientId: CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirectUri: REDIRECT_URI,
    mode: "simulated",
  });
  ```

  ```python Python
  client = smartcar.AuthClient(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI,
    mode="simulated"
  )
  ```

  ```java Java
  AuthClient authClient = new AuthClient.Builder()
    .clientId(CLIENT_ID)
    .clientSecret(CLIENT_SECRET)
    .redirectUri(REDIRECT_URI)
    .mode("simulated")
    .build();
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
  client = Smartcar::AuthClient.new({
    client_id: CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,
    mode: "simulated"
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Log into a connected services account

After launching Smartcar Connect, select the brand that matches your simulated vehicle and enter the credentials pulled from the Smartcar Dashboard simulation screen on the brand login page. You will then be prompted to grant access to your selected permissions.

Upon completing the Smartcar Connect flow, return to the Smartcar Dashboard. It may take up to a minute to reflect that your vehicle is now connected. Once connected, the vehicle ID will appear next to the vehicle's VIN near the top of the simulation screen.

## 3. Start the simulation and begin testing

Once the vehicle is connected to your application, you are ready to start the simulation and begin making API requests to the simulated vehicle.

### Start the simulation

In the Smartcar Dashboard on the simulation screen for your selected simulated vehicle, start the simulation by pressing the Play button. You have the option to pause, resume or restart the simulation at any time. Additional controls you have over the simulation:

#### Control the simulation speed

You can control the simulation's speed in case you would like to test the vehicle at various stages at a faster or slower pace.

#### Change the simulation stage

Once the simulation has started, you can jump to any stage of the simulation in the event you would like to test the vehicle in a particular state.

#### Set the API response latency

Control the response latency of any API requests you make to the simulated vehicle.

`Ideal` - API responses are returned immediately upon request.

`Realistic` - API responses are delayed a certain amount of time based on average API response latency statistics that Smartcar has gathered for each supported brand.

A breakdown of estimated response latencies can be viewed by clicking on the ‘View latencies’ link directly underneath the Request Latency dropdown in the Dashboard. Please note latency estimates may not be available for all brands. In these cases, the Realistic setting will return immediate responses -- same as Ideal.

#### Change the vehicle state

You can select a different vehicle state for your simulated vehicle at any time. Select the Edit icon in the `Trip type` card on the simulation screen.

### Send an API request to the simulated vehicle

The Smartcar API will return realistic data matching the current state of the simulated vehicle as displayed on the simulation screen. Note that if you've selected Realistic API response latency, the data returned to your application may appear somewhat delayed.

provider. Invites via the Dashboard will be disabled while SSO is enabled.

<Frame>
  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/dashboard/sso/invite-with-sso.png)
</Frame>

When a newly added member has signed in via SSO, they will have the Viewer role
by default. Other team members with the appropriate role can promote these
members as needed.

<Note>
  If a user creates a Dashboard account with their email prior to being added
  to your IdP, they will be added to their own Team initially. When they are
  added to your IdP they will be able to switch Teams in Dashboard.
</Note>

## A note on aliased emails

If members of your team have Dashboard accounts using email aliases prior to
enabling SSO e.g. [rover+thebest@dog.com](mailto:rover+thebest@dog.com), once SSO is enabled for your Team and
they’re added to your IdP, their login will be tied to their non-aliased email
address e.g. [rover@dog.com](mailto:rover@dog.com).

SSO is only available on the **Enterprise** plan, please reach out to your Account Manager for more details.


# Charging station utilization
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/guides/charging-station-utilization

This guide explains how to use the Smartcar API to enhance charging station discoverability by leveraging vehicle data such as state of charge,  battery level, range, and location. These capabilities allow developers to help EV drivers find nearby charging stations based on real-time vehicle data.

## Prerequisites: Creating your application

Before implementing the Smartcar API for charging station discoverability,
ensure you have:

* Created a Smartcar Account and registered your application to obtain your
  `client_id` and `client_secret`.
* Set up Smartcar Connect Flow to authenticate and authorize users.

<Note> For more details, refer to the [Getting Started
Guide](/getting-started/introduction). </Note>

## Smartcar API Endpoints for charging station discoverability

Use the following Smartcar API endpoints to help drivers locate nearby charging
stations based on their vehicle’s current range and location.

### 1. Determine EV Range

Once a vehicle is authorized via Smartcar’s Connect flow, you can use the
vehicle’s access token to retrieve the current battery level and range through
the [GET /battery](/api-reference/evs/get-battery-level) endpoint.

```curl Range Remaining and SoC
    GET /vehicles/{vehicle_id}/battery
```

```json Example Response
{
    "percentRemaining": 0.3,
    "range": 40.5
}
```

### 2. Retrieve Vehicle Location

To locate nearby charging stations based on the vehicle’s current location, use
the [GET /location](/api-reference/get-location) endpoint.

```curl Location
    GET /vehicles/{vehicle_id}/location
```

```json Example Response
{
    "latitude": 37.4292,
    "longitude": -122.1381
}
```

### 3. Calculate Distance to Charging Stations

Once you have the vehicle's location, compare it with nearby charging stations’
coordinates. Charging station locations can be sourced from a Charge Point
Operator (CPO) or through third-party services such as Google’s Places API.
Calculate the distance and estimated time to reach these stations using Google’s
Distance Matrix API or a similar service.

* Sourcing Charging Station Data: While Smartcar provides vehicle location data,
  you’ll need to source station coordinates from a CPO database or third-party API
  like Google’s Places API.
* Distance Calculation: Use Google’s Distance Matrix API to compute the travel
  distance and time, factoring in real-time traffic conditions and travel modes.
  This process helps drivers locate the nearest available charging stations in
  real time, offering a smooth and integrated experience.

This process helps drivers locate the nearest available charging stations in
real time, offering a smooth and integrated experience.

### 4. Send Destination to Vehicle Navigation (Optional)

Once you’ve identified the nearest charging station, guide the driver to the
location. Depending on the vehicle’s capabilities, there are two options for
navigation:

1. **Mobile Navigation Apps**: For vehicles that don’t support in-dash
   navigation, dispatch the destination coordinates to a mobile app (e.g., Google
   Maps, Apple Maps). This ensures drivers can still navigate using their
   smartphone..
2. **Send to in-dash navigation**: For vehicles that support in-dash
   navigation, Smartcar allows you to send destination coordinates directly to the
   onboard system. This allows for seamless, in-vehicle routing. You can check
   which brands support this feature by visiting the Supported Brands section.

Use [Send Destination](/api-reference/send-destination-to-vehicle) for supported
vehicles to send coordinates to the vehicle's navigation.

```curl Send Destination
    POST /vehicles/navigation/destination
    {
        "latitude": 37.4292,
        "longitude": -122.1381
    }
```

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does this use case require regular polling or scheduled polling?">
    Scheduled polling is recommended for passive monitoring of vehicle data. For
    real-time use cases, such as finding the nearest charging station based on
    current range and location, sending requests on-demand is more efficient.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
    title="What additional data sources are needed besides the
SmartcarAPI?"
  >
    To locate nearby charging stations, you will need external data sources to
    locate nearby charging stations. This data can be sourced from Charge Point
    Operators (CPOs) or third-party services like Google’s Places API. You may
    also use public databases such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
    (NREL) API for detailed information on charging station availability and
    locations.

    You may also wish to use Google’s Distance Matrix API to help
    calculate drive distance and time based on real-time traffic conditions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the Smartcar API charger-agnostic?">
    Yes, Smartcar’s API enables integration with any charging station network by
    providing vehicle data through our platform.

```curl Odometer
curl "https://api.smartcar.com/v2.0/vehicles/{id}/odometer" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
    -X "GET"
```

```json Example Response
    {
        "distance": 104.32
    }
```

**Use Case**
Send a notification when a vehicle’s odometer reading reaches maintenance intervals, such as every 5,000 miles.<br />

### 2. Monitor Engine Oil Life

Retrieve oil life data to prompt users when an oil change is due.

```curl Engine Oil Life
curl "https://api.smartcar.com/v2.0/vehicles/{id}/engine/oil" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
    -X "GET"
```

```json Example Response
{
  "lifeRemaining": 0.35
}
```

**Use Case**
Trigger a service reminder when oil life falls below 20% to prevent engine damage.<br />

### 3. Retrieve Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)

DTCs help you identify and diagnose specific vehicle issues, allowing for quick and accurate repairs.

```curl DTCs

              "description": null
          },
      ]
}
```

**Use Case**
Notify users or fleet operators if the engine status changes to warning or the battery health declines.

## Webhooks for Preventive Maintenance

Webhooks enable real-time notifications for certain vehicle events, reducing the
need for polling. Examples include:

* **DTC Updates**: Receive a webhook when a new trouble code is logged.
* **System Changes**: Get updates for changes in engine or battery status.

### Setting Up Webhooks

To receive real-time notifications (e.g., when new DTCs appear), consider
setting up webhooks:

1. **Create a Webhook:** Configure a secure endpoint on your server to handle POST
   requests from Smartcar.
2. **Register the Webhook:** Specify which events (such as DTC) you want to
   subscribe to.
3. **Instant Alerts:** When an event triggers, Smartcar sends a payload to your endpoint, enabling immediate responses (like sending notifications or scheduling service).

<Tip>
  See the [Smartcar Webhooks Documentation](/getting-started/tutorials/webhooks-diagnostic) for more information.
</Tip>

### Example Workflow

1. **Authorization**: The user logs in via Smartcar Connect to grant access to
   vehicle data.
2. **Monitoring**: Your backend polls GET endpoints (e.g., odometer, oil, system
   status) or listens for webhook events.
3. **Threshold Detection**: Evaluate data (e.g., oil life \< 20%, mileage > 5,000
   miles) and identify DTCs or system warnings.
4. **Notifications**: Send push notifications, emails, or SMS to users with
   maintenance reminders or alerts.
5. **Ongoing Updates**: Combine periodic polling and webhooks to ensure vehicles stay road-ready.

# Enabling simplified payments
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/guides/simplified-payments

This guide outlines how charge point operators can utilize the Smartcar API to implement plug-and-charge capabilities, enabling automatic billing and session management through vehicle identification and charging data.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing plug-and-charge capabilities, ensure you have:

* Created a Smartcar account and registered your application to obtain your
  client\_id and client\_secret.
* Set up the Smartcar Connect flow to authenticate and authorize users.

<Tip>
  For more details, refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/).
</Tip>

## How Plug-and-Charge Works

Plug-and-charge allows drivers to initiate charging sessions and handle payments
automatically without interacting with external apps or card readers. By
integrating with the Smartcar EV Charging API, operators can:

* **Automate billing** using vehicle identification data (VIN).
* **Control charging** sessions remotely to provide a seamless user experience.

This guide details how to use specific Smartcar API endpoints to implement
plug-and-charge functionality for electric vehicles.

## API Endpoints for Plug-and-Charge Integration

### 1. Retrieve VIN

The [GET /vin](/api-reference/evs/get-vin) endpoint helps link a vehicle to the
driver's account for billing by returning the unique vehicle identification
number, used for identifying and authenticating vehicles during plug-and-charge.

```curl VIN
GET /vehicles/{vehicle_id}/vin
```

```json Example Response
{
    "vin" : "2SCTESLFHL4SB3S9S"
}
```

### 2. Retrieve Battery State of Charge (SoC)

You can retrieve the current battery level and range through
the [GET /battery](/api-reference/evs/get-battery-level) endpoint. The battery’s
state of charge is essential for calculating energy consumption during charging.

```curl Range Remaining and SoC
GET /vehicles/{vehicle_id}/battery
```

```json Example Response
{
    "percentRemaining": 0.3,
    "range": 40.5
}
```

### 3. Remote Start and Stop Charging

Use the [POST /charge](/api-reference/evs/control-charge) endpoint to initiate
and end charging sessions remotely.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Start Charging">
    ```curl Start charge
    POST /vehicles/{vehicle_id}/charge
        {
            "action" : "START"
        }
    ```

    ```json Example Response
    {
        "message" : "success"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Stop Charging">
    ```curl Stop charge
    POST /vehicles/{vehicle_id}/charge
        {
            "action" : "STOP"
        }
    ```

    ```json Example Response
    {
        "message" : "success"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Implementation Workflow

### 1.Authorize Vehicle Access:

Ensure the vehicle is authenticated through the Smartcar Connect flow to allow
API access.

### 2.Check Battery State:

Retrieve the state of charge (SoC) using GET /battery to determine the current
battery level. This ensures that charging sessions start when necessary, and it
allows for accurate tracking of energy consumption from the beginning of the
session.

### 3.Identify Vehicle

Retrieve the VIN using GET /vin to identify the vehicle and link it with the
driver’s account for billing.

### 4.Initiate Charging

Start the charging process remotely using POST /charge/start. The vehicle’s VIN
will be used for billing.

### 5.Monitor Charging Session

Retrieve the state of charge with GET /battery to monitor energy consumption
during the session.

### 6.Stop Charging

End the session with POST /charge/stop once the desired energy level is reached
or based on scheduled requirements.

## Best Practices

* **Link VIN to Payment Account:** Always ensure that the VIN is associated with a valid payment account before initiating plug-and-charge.
* **Monitor SoC Continuously:** Regularly monitor the battery’s SOC to determine the energy consumed during charging, ensuring accurate billing.
* **Use Secure API Calls**: Ensure secure authentication for requests to restrict charging control to authorized users only.

# Plan Your Integration
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/integration-overview



There are 3 main steps to integrate Smartcar into your application to make API requests to vehicles:

1. Launch Connect to get consent from the vehicle owner
2. Fetch an access token
3. Make a request to the vehicle

## The architecture that's right for you

[Smartcar Connect](/connect/what-is-connect) is Smartcar’s [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authorization flow. It is your users’ first and only touchpoint with Smartcar. After a user enters the Smartcar Connect
flow and authorizes their vehicle(s), your application is able to make requests to the Smartcar API. Those requests allow your application to retrieve information and send commands to the
user’s vehicle(s), such as reading the odometer and unlocking the doors.

<Tip>
  Depending on your web or mobile application architecture, you can implement the Smartcar Connect flow in different ways.

## Let's get building

Now you have an idea of how Smartcar works, take a look at one of our Getting Started guides in the tutorials section to get connected to a vehicle.

{/* <Frame type="simple" caption="Smartcar Connect">
  <img src="/images/integration-overview/StandardFlow.png" />
  </Frame> */}

{/* ## 2. Adapt Smartcar Connect to your use case

  ### Fit Smartcar Connect into the user journey

  To increase conversions and maximize your users’ satisfaction, it is crucial to launch Smartcar Connect at the right moment in your product’s user journey.

  We recommend prompting the user to connect their car through Smartcar Connect while they are onboarding their vehicle to your application for the first time.

  ### Standard: Let the user connect one or more vehicles

  In the standard Smartcar Connect flow, the user selects their car brand and logs in with the username and password of their vehicle’s connected services account. On the next screen, the user can see all vehicles associated with their account. The user can select one or multiple of these vehicles and grant your application access to them.



  We recommend using the standard Smartcar Connect flow whenever you don’t yet know the make or VIN of your user’s vehicle(s). If you know the make or VIN of your user’s vehicle(s), we recommend personalizing the Smartcar Connect flow in the following ways:

  ### Optional: Skip the car brand selection screen

  If you know the make of your user’s vehicle(s) prior to launching Smartcar Connect, we recommend using [Brand Select](https://smartcar.com/docs/api#brand-select). Brand Select causes the user to automatically skip the car brand selection screen. Instead, the user lands directly on their vehicle brand’s login screen. This speeds up the onboarding experience and increases conversions.

  <Frame type="glass">
  <img src="/images/ConnectDirect.png" />
  </Frame>

  ### Optional: Check a vehicle’s eligibility before launching Smartcar Connect

  If you know the VIN of your user’s vehicle prior to launching Smartcar Connect, we recommend using the [Compatibility API](/api-reference). The Compatibility API lets you verify a vehicle’s eligibility before sending a user through Smartcar Connect. That way, your application will show Smartcar Connect to users with compatible vehicles only.

  <Info>
  The Compatibility API is only available for vehicles sold in the United
  States.
  </Info>

  ### Optional: Make sure the user connects the right vehicle

  If you know the VIN of your user’s vehicle prior to launching Smartcar Connect, we recommend using [Single Select](https://smartcar.com/docs/api#single-select). Single Select causes the user to skip the car brand selection screen. It also limits them to connecting only the vehicle with that specific VIN, even if the user has registered multiple vehicles under the same connected services account. This simplifies the user experience and guarantees that the user connects the right vehicle to your application.

  <Frame type="glass">
  <img src="/images/ConnectMatch.png" />
  </Frame>

  ## 3. Set optional and/or required permissions

  When [redirecting a user to Smartcar Connect](https://smartcar.com/docs/api#smartcar-connect), you need to include a `scope` parameter that indicates which permissions your application requests access to. Every vehicle endpoint has a permission name associated with it. For example, the permission name for the [/fuel endpoint](/api-reference/EVs/EV-charging-limit) is `read_fuel`. Please see our [API reference](/api-reference) for a full list of all permission names.

  ### Optional permissions

  Not all vehicles are capable of all permissions. For example, Tesla vehicles aren’t capable of the `read_fuel` permission, because they don’t have fuel tanks. In order to handle this smoothly, all permissions that your application requests access to in Smartcar Connect are optional by default.

  For example, let’s assume that your app requests access to the `read_location` and the `read_fuel` permissions. A user connects their Tesla vehicle through Smartcar Connect. The user is able to successfully authorize their vehicle, because both, the `read_location` and the `read_fuel` permission are optional. In the background, your application is granted permission to the `read_location` endpoint only, because the vehicle is incapable of the read_fuel permission.

  In order to verify which permissions your application was granted access to, make a request to the [/permissions endpoint](/api-reference/vehicles/revoke-access):

  <CodeGroup>

  ```java Node
  const permissions = await vehicle.permissions();
  console.log(permissions);
  ```

  ```python Python
  response = vehicle.permissions()
  print(response)
  ```

  ```java Java
  ApplicationPermissions response = vehicle.permissions();
  System.out.println(response);
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
  response = vehicle.permissions
  puts response.permissions
  ```

  </CodeGroup>

  ### Required permissions

  If certain permissions are essential to your application’s use case, you can make them required by adding the `required`: prefix to each pertaining permission within the `scope` parameter (e.g. `required:read_fuel`). The user is then able to authorize a vehicle only if the vehicle is capable of all required permissions.

  For example, let’s assume that you mark both `read_location` and `read_fuel` as required in the scope parameter. A user tries to connect their Tesla vehicle through Smartcar Connect. As Tesla vehicles are incapable of the read_fuel permission, the user isn’t able to successfully authorize their vehicle. Instead, Smartcar sends the vehicle_incompatible error back to your application.

  <CodeGroup>

  ```java Node
  const client = new smartcar.AuthClient({
  clientId: CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirectUri: REDIRECT_URI,
  });
  const scope = ["required:read_location", "required:read_fuel"];
  const authUrl = client.getAuthUrl(scope);
  ```

  ```python Python
  client = smartcar.AuthClient(
  client_id=CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI,
  )
  scope = ['required:read_location', 'required:read_fuel']
  auth_url = client.get_auth_url(scope=scope)
  ```

  ```java Java
  AuthClient authClient = new AuthClient.Builder()
    .clientId(CLIENT_ID)
    .clientSecret(CLIENT_SECRET)
    .redirectUri(REDIRECT_URI)
    .build();
  String[] scope = new String[]{"required:read_location", "required:read_fuel"};
  String authUrl = authClient.authUrlBuilder(scope).build();
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
  client = Smartcar::AuthClient.new({
  client_id: CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,

Smartcar is the only car API built with the highest standard for privacy and security. We allow your application to communicate with millions of vehicles easily and securely while giving vehicle owners the choice of how they share their data.

Below are a few concepts to help you get familiar with Smartcar's API.

Let’s get building!

## What you need before you get started

Before making requests to a vehicle, the owner must grant your application permission to access their data. To request permission from the vehicle owner, you must present the Smartcar Connect flow to the user. To launch Smartcar Connect, you need to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your credentials and configure your app">
    Register an application and get your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`. Set a `REDIRECT_URI` to the path where Smartcar will redirect your users after they grant permission to your app. You can get these from the [Smartcar Dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch Smartcar Connect">
    With your `CLIENT_ID` and `REDIRECT_URI` you can launch [Connect](/connect). This is how you and your users can add vehicles to your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Exchange and store your tokens">
    Once users authorize your app to access their vehicles, you receive a `code` that you can exchange for an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `REFRESH_TOKEN`. Make sure to store these tokens in a secure place (like your application's database). You need the access token to make requests to the Smartcar API. More information can be found in our [Token Management Overview](https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/token-management/overview).
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Test Your Integration
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/test-your-integration



Before launching your integration, use Smartcar’s simulated mode to quickly test your application.

If you prefer to control the vehicle type and receive consistent data in API responses, consider using Smartcar’s [Vehicle Simulator](/getting-started/dashboard/simulator)

If you are not testing with a simulated vehicle, Simulated mode will randomized data for every API request.

## Test successful API requests

### 1. Enabling simulated mode

When launching Smartcar Connect, pass in the query parameter `mode=simulated` to enable simulated mode. Smartcar’s SDKs provide a convenient option to facilitate this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```node Node
  const client = new smartcar.AuthClient({
    clientId: CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirectUri: REDIRECT_URI,
    mode: 'simulated',
  });
  ```

  ```python Python
  client = smartcar.AuthClient(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI,
    mode='simulated'
  )
  ```

  ```java Java
  AuthClient authClient = new AuthClient.Builder()
    .clientId(CLIENT_ID)
    .clientSecret(CLIENT_SECRET)
    .redirectUri(REDIRECT_URI)
    .mode("simulated")
    .build();
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
  client = Smartcar::AuthClient.new({
    client_id: CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,
    mode: 'simulated'
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Log into a simulated connected services account

User your simulated vehicle credentials to log in, or select any vehicle brand and log in with any email address `(anything@anything.com)` and any password.

### 3. Send an API request to the simulated vehicle

Our API will return simulated data for each endpoint the simulated vehicle is able to provide, or randomized data for each other endpoint.

For example, a simulated Tesla will return battery capacity consistently, but will return randomized data if fuel level is requested.

See our API reference to learn more about the randomized data you should expect. If you use Single Select, use the below VIN and make a request as follows.

| Email                             | VIN               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `smartcar@successful-request.com` | 0SCAUDI037A5ADB1C |

<CodeGroup>
  ```node Node
  const scope = ["read_vehicle_info"]
  const options = singleSelect: {vin: '0SCAUDI037A5ADB1C'}
  authUrl = client.getAuthUrl(scope, options);
  ```

  ```python Python
  scope = ['read_vehicle_info']
  options = { single_select={'vin': '0SCAUDI037A5ADB1C'} }
  auth_url = client.get_auth_url(scope, options)
  ```

  ```java Java
  String authUrl = authClient.authUrlBuilder()
    .singleSelect(true)
    .singleSelectVin("0SCAUDI037A5ADB1C")
    .build();
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
  scope = %w(read_vehicle_info)
  options = { "singleSelect": { vin: "0SCAUDI037A5ADB1C" } }
  auth_url = client.get_auth_url(scope, options)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Test successful API requests with specific VINs

If you need a test vehicle with a specific VIN, you can still use simulated mode. When logging into a test mode connected services account (step 2 above), follow this format for the email address:

`<VIN>@<compatibility level>.smartcar.com`

**VIN**: This can be any 17-character alphanumeric string. Note: This string does not need to be a real VIN. Smartcar does not perform any VIN-specific validations.

**Compatibility level**: This string determines which permissions the test mode vehicle is capable of. The following table contains all valid compatibility levels and their corresponding permissions:

| Compatibility level | Permissions                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| compatible OR phev  | All permissions                                      |
| incompatible        | No permissions                                       |
| fuel                | Permissions that apply to a gasoline vehicle         |
| bev                 | Permissions that apply to a battery-electric vehicle |

To use Single Select in test mode with a specific VIN, follow step 3 above and replace the Smartcar-provided VIN with the VIN of your choice. Then follow the email format `<VIN>@<compatibility level>.smartcar.com` using the same VIN.

## Test with multiple vehicles

In some cases, you may want to test the Connect flow with an account that has more vehicles than our default test accounts to help ensure your application is paginating and fetching data for a large number of vehicles correctly. You can do this with the following email format in Test mode and any password:

`<number>-vehicles@smartcar.com`

Number: Any number from 1-999. Smartcar will show this many vehicles on the permission grant screen and return this many vehicles from the /vehicles endpoint, with pagination.


# Android Tutorial
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/android

In this tutorial, we will use the Android SDK to integrate Connect into your application.

<Warning>
  Our frontend SDKs handle getting an authorization code representing a vehicle owner's consent for your application to interact with their vehicle
  for the requested permissions. In order to make requests to a vehicle, please use one of our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks).

  For security, token exchanges and requests to vehicles **should not** be made client side.
</Warning>

# Overview

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/android/overview.png" />
</Frame>

<br />

1. The Mobile Application launches a `Chrome Custom Tab` with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with their vehicle credentials and grants the Application access to their vehicle.
2. The `Chrome Tab` is redirected to a specified `REDIRECT_URI` along with an authorization `code`.
   This will be the custom scheme set on the application. The Smartcar Android receives the authorization `code` in a view listening
   for the specified custom scheme URI, and passes it to the Mobile Application.
3. The Mobile Application sends the received authorization `code` to the Application’s backend service.
4. The Application sends a request to the Smartcar API. This request contains the authorization code along with the Application’s
   `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
5. In response, Smartcar returns an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
6. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Application can now send requests to the Smartcar API. It can access protected resources and send commands
   to and from the user’s vehicle via the backend service.

# Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup) for a Smartcar account.
* Make a note of your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the **Configuration** section on the Dashboard.
* Add a custom scheme redirect URI to your application configuration.
* Add the `app_server` redirect URI from [Setup step 2.](/tutorials/android#setup) to your application configuration.

<Note>
  For Android, we require the custom URI scheme to be in the format of `sc` + `clientId` + `://` + `hostname`.
  For now, you can just set it to `sc` + `clientId` + `://exchange`.

  Please see our [Connect Docs](/connect/dashboard-config#redirect-uris) for more information.
</Note>

# Setup

1. Clone our repo and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-android-sdk.git
   ```
   <Note>
     Do not “checkout from version control” with the Getting Started repo in Android Studio, as it will not open the proper module.
   </Note>

2. Open `getting-started-android-sdk/tutorial` in Android Studio as an existing project and build from existing sources.
   Android Studio should automatically import the required dependencies and build gradle. We're setting `app_server` to `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
   to pass the authorization `code` from the [Handle the Response](/tutorials/android#handle-the-response) step later on in the tutorial to our backend.
   ```xml strings.xml
   <string name="smartcar_auth_scheme">sc[yourClientId]</string>
   <string name="client_id">[yourClientId]</string>
   <string name="app_server">http://10.0.2.2:8000</string>
   ```

# Build your Connect URL

1. Instantiate a `smartcarAuth` object in the `onCreate` function of the `MainActivity`.
   ```java MainActivity.java
   // TODO: Authorization Step 1a: Initialize the Smartcar object
   private static String CLIENT_ID;
   private static String REDIRECT_URI;
   private static String[] SCOPE;
   private SmartcarAuth smartcarAuth;

   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       ...
       
       // TODO: Authorization Step 1b: Initialize the Smartcar object
       CLIENT_ID = getString(R.string.client_id);
       REDIRECT_URI = getString(R.string.smartcar_auth_scheme) + "://" + getString(R.string.smartcar_auth_host);
       SCOPE = new String[]{"required:read_vehicle_info"};
       
       smartcarAuth = new SmartcarAuth(
           CLIENT_ID,
           REDIRECT_URI,
           SCOPE,
           true,
           new SmartcarCallback() {
               // TODO: Authorization Step 3b: Receive an authorization code
           }
       );
   }
   ```

<Info>
  The Android SDK does not support `simulated` mode at this time - only `test` and `live`.
  Feel free to set `testMode` to `false` where you instantiate your `SmartcarAuth` object to
  connect to a real vehicle.
</Info>

2. The Android application will launch a Chrome Tab with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for their vehicle’s connected services account and grants the application access to their vehicle.

   To launch Connect, we can use the `addClickHandler` function that our `smartcarAuth` object has access to.

   ```java MainActivity.java
   // TODO: Authorization Step 2: Launch Connect
   smartcarAuth.addClickHandler(appContext, connectButton);
   ```

# Registering your Custom Scheme

Once a user has authorized the application to access their vehicle, the user is redirected to the `REDIRECT_URI` with an authorization `code` as a query parameter.

Android applications use custom URI schemes to intercept calls and launch the relevant application. This is defined within the `AndroidManifest`.

```xml AndroidManifest.xml
<!-- TODO: Authorization Step 3a: Receive an authorization code -->
<activity android:name="com.smartcar.sdk.SmartcarCodeReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        <data
            android:host="@string/smartcar_auth_host"
            android:scheme="@string/smartcar_auth_scheme" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

# Handle the response

Using the Android SDK, the application can receive the code in the `SmartcarCallback` object passed into the `SmartcarAuth` object.

```java MainActivity.java
smartcarAuth = new SmartcarAuth(
    CLIENT_ID,
    REDIRECT_URI,
    SCOPE,
    true,
    new SmartcarCallback() {
        // TODO: Authorization Step 3b: Receive an authorization code
        @Override
        public void handleResponse(final SmartcarResponse smartcarResponse) {
            Log.i("MainActivity", smartcarResponse.getCode());

            // TODO: Request Step 1: Obtain an access token

            //TODO: Request Step 2: Get vehicle information
        }
    }
);
```

# Launching Connect

Build your application in Android Studio and click on the **Connect your vehicle** button.

<Info>
  This tutorial configures Connect to launch in `test` mode by default.
  In `test` mode, any `username` and `password` is valid for each brand.
</Info>

Smartcar showcases all the permissions your application is asking for - `read_vehicle_info` in this case.
Once you have logged in and accepted the permissions, you should see your authorization `code` printed to your console.

# Getting your first access token

After receiving the authorization `code`, your iOS application must exchange it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`. To do so, we can send
the code to a backend service. Let’s assume our backend service contains an endpoint `/exchange` that receives an authorization `code` as a query parameter and exchanges it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

```swift ViewController.swift
// TODO: Obtain an access token
public void handleResponse(final SmartcarResponse smartcarResponse) {
    Log.i("MainActivity", smartcarResponse.getCode());

    final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

    // TODO: Request Step 1: Obtain and access token

    // Request can not run on the Main Thread
    // Main Thread is used for UI and therefore can not be blocked
    new Thread(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
    
            // send request to exchange the auth code for the access token
            Request exchangeRequest = new Request.Builder()
                .url(getString(R.string.app_server) + "/exchange?code=" + smartcarResponse.getCode())
                .build();
        
            try {
                client.newCall(exchangeRequest).execute();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }).start();
}
```

<Warning>
  Notice that our backend service **does not** return the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.
  This is by design. For security, our frontend should never have access
  to the `ACCESS_TOKEN` and should always be stored in the backend.
</Warning>

# Getting data from a vehicle

Once the backend has the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, it can send requests to a vehicle using the Smartcar API. The Android app will
have to send a request to the backend service which in turn sends a request to Smartcar. We have to do this because
our frontend **does not** have the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Assuming our backend has a `/vehicle` endpoint that returns the information of a user’s vehicle, we can make this query in
our `completion callback` and start another `activity` to show the returned vehicle attributes.

```java MainActivity.java
public void handleResponse(final SmartcarResponse smartcarResponse) {
    ...
    
    // TODO: Request Step 2: Get vehicle information

    // send request to retrieve the vehicle info
    Request infoRequest = new Request.Builder()
        .url(getString(R.string.app_server) + "/vehicle")
        .build();
    
    try {
        Response response = client.newCall(infoRequest).execute();
    
        String jsonBody = response.body().string();
        JSONObject JObject = new JSONObject(jsonBody);
    
        String make = JObject.getString("make");
        String model = JObject.getString("model");
        String year = JObject.getString("year");
    
        Intent intent = new Intent(appContext, DisplayInfoActivity.class);
        intent.putExtra("INFO", make + " " + model + " " + year);
        startActivity(intent);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (JSONException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

# Setting up your backend

Now that our frontend is complete, we will need to create a backend service that contains the logic for the `/exchange` and `/vehicle` endpoints.
You can use any of our backend SDKs below to set up the service starting from the **Obtaining an Access Token** step.

<Note>
  When setting up the environment variables for your  backend SDK, make sure to set `REDIRECT_URI` to the custom scheme
  used for this tutorial i.e. `sc + "clientId" + ://exchange`.

# Backend SDK Tutorials
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/backend

In this tutorial, we will go over how  to integrate Connect into your application and make requests to a vehicle using our backend SDKs.

# Overview

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/backend-sdks/overview.png" />
</Frame>

<br />

1. The Application redirects the user to Smartcar Connect to request access to the user’s vehicle. In Connect,
   the user logs in with their vehicle credentials and grants the Application access to their vehicle.
2. The user’s browser is redirected to a specified `REDIRECT_URI`. The Application Server, which is listening
   at the `REDIRECT_URI`, will retrieve the authorization code from query parameters sent to the `REDIRECT_URI`.
3. The Application sends a request to the Smartcar API. This request contains the authorization `code` along with
   the Application’s `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
4. In response, Smartcar returns an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
5. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Application can now send requests to the Smartcar API. It can access protected resources and send commands
   to and from the user’s vehicle via the backend service.

# Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup) for a Smartcar account.
* Make a note of your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the **Configuration** section on the Dashboard.
* Add the following `REDIRECT_URI` to your application configuration: `http://localhost:8000/exchange`

# Setup

1. Clone the repo for the SDK you want to use and install the required dependencies:
   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash Node
     $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-express.git
     $cd getting-started-express/tutorial
     $npm install
     ```

     ```bash Python
     $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-python-sdk.git
     $cd getting-started-python-sdk/tutorial
     $pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

     ```bash Java
     $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-java-sdk.git
     $cd getting-started-java-sdk/tutorial
     $gradlew build
     ```

     ```bash Ruby
     $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-ruby-sdk.git
     $cd getting-started-ruby-sdk/tutorial
     $bundle install
     $ruby app.rb
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
2. You will also have to set the following environment variables

<Warning>
  If you've used one of our frontend SDKs to integrate connect, you'll want to set the
  `SMARTCAR_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable to the URI you used for that application.
</Warning>

```bash
$export SMARTCAR_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
$export SMARTCAR_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
$export SMARTCAR_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/exchange
```

<Note>
  If you are using Windows, ensure you are appropriately setting environment variables for your shell.
  Please refer to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9249830/how-can-i-set-node-env-production-on-windows/9250168#9250168) which details how to set environment variables on Windows.
</Note>

<br />

# Build your Connect URL

1. Instantiate a `Smartcar` object in the constructor of the App component.
   <CodeGroup>
     ```js index.js
     const client = new smartcar.AuthClient({
         mode: 'simulated',
     });
     ```

     ```python main.py
     client = smartcar.AuthClient(mode='simulated')
     ```

     ```java Main.java
     String mode = "simulated";

     AuthClient client = new AuthClient.Builder()
     .mode(mode)
     .build();
     ```

     ```ruby index.rb
     @@client = Smartcar::AuthClient.new({
         mode: 'simulated',
     })
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Feel free to set `mode` to `simulated` or `live` where you instantiate your `Smartcar` object to
  connect to a simulated or real vehicle.
</Info>

2. A Server-side rendered application will redirect to Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for their vehicle’s connected services account
   and grants the application access to their vehicle.

   To launch Connect, we need to redirect the user to the appropriate URL. We can make use of the `AUTHORIZATION_URL`
   function in our Smartcar object and redirect the user to the URL to launch the Connect flow.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```js index.js
     app.get('/login', function(req, res) {
         const scope = ['read_vehicle_info'];
         const authUrl = client.getAuthUrl(scope);

         res.render('home', {
             url: authUrl,
         });
     });
     ```

     ```python main.py
     @app.route('/login', methods=['GET'])
     def login():
         scope = ['read_vehicle_info']
         auth_url = client.get_auth_url(scope)
         return redirect(auth_url)        
     ```

     ```java Main.java
     get("/login", (req, res) -> {
         // TODO: Authorization Step 2: Launch Smartcar authentication dialog
         String[] scope = {"read_odometer"};
         String link = client.authUrlBuilder(scope).build();
         res.redirect(link);
         return null;
     });
     ```

     ```ruby index.rb
     get "/login" do
         redirect @@client.get_auth_url(['required:read_vehicle_info'])
     end
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

<br />

# Handle the response

Once a user has authorized the application to access their vehicle, the user is redirected to the `REDIRECT_URI`
with an authorization `code` as a query parameter. In the previous section, we had set our `REDIRECT_URI` as `localhost:8000/exchange`.
Now, our server can be set up as follows to receive the authorization `code`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js index.js
  app.get('/exchange', function(req, res) {
  const code = req.query.code;

  console.log(code);

  res.sendStatus(200);
  });
  ```

  ```python main.py
  @app.route('/exchange', methods=['GET'])
  def exchange():
      code = request.args.get('code')
      
      print(code)
      
      return '', 200      
  ```

  ```java Main.java
  get("/exchange", (req, res) -> {
      String code = req.queryMap("code").value();

      System.out.println(code);

      return "";
  });
  ```

  ```ruby index.rb
  get "/exchange" do
      code = params[:code]

      puts code

      "OK"
  end
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

# Launching Connect

Let’s try authenticating a vehicle! Restart your server, open up your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/login`

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Node
  $node index.js
  ```

  ```bash Python
  $python main.py
  ```

  ```bash Java
  $./gradlew run
  ```

  ```bash Ruby
  $bundle exec ruby app.rb
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>
  This tutorial configures Connect to launch in `test` mode by default.
  In `test` mode, any `username` and `password` is valid for each brand.
</Info>

Smartcar showcases all the permissions your application is asking for - `read_vehicle_info` in this case.
Once you have logged in and accepted the permissions, you should see your authorization `code` printed to your console.

<br />

# Getting your first access token

<Note>
  If you've used one of our frontend SDKs to integrate Connect, this is where you'll need to fetch your access token.
</Note>

In the previous section, we retrieved an authorization `code`. The application must exchange the code for an `ACCESS_TOKEN` to make a request.
After receiving the ACCESS\_TOKEN, the user can be redirected to the `/vehicle` route.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js index.js
  // Global variable to save our access_token
  let access;

  app.get('/exchange', async function(req, res) {
      const code = req.query.code;
      
      // Access our global variable and store our access tokens.
      // In a production app you'll want to store this in some 
      // kind of persistent storage
      access = await client.exchangeCode(code);
      res.redirect('/vehicle');
  });
  ```

  ```python main.py
  # Global variable to save our access_token
  access = None

  @app.route('/exchange', methods=['GET'])
  def exchange():
      code = request.args.get('code')

      # Access our global variable and store our access tokens.
      # In a production app you'll want to store this in some
      # kind of persistent storage
      global access

      access = client.exchange_code(code)
      return redirect('/vehicle')      
  ```

  ```java Main.java
  // Global variable to save our access_token
  private static String access;

  public static void main(String[] args) {

      get("/exchange", (req, res) -> {
          String code = req.queryMap("code").value();

          Auth auth = client.exchangeCode(code);
          
          // Access our global variable and store our access tokens.
          // In a production app you'll want to store this in some 
          // kind of persistent storage
          access = auth.getAccessToken();
          
          res.redirect("/vehicle");
          return null;
      })
  }
  ```

  ```ruby index.rb
  # Global variable to store the token
  @@token = ''

  get "/exchange" do
      code = params[:code]
      # Access our global variable and store our access tokens.
      # In a production app you'll want to store this in 
      # some kind of persistent storage
      @@token = @@client.exchange_code(code)[:access_token]
      redirect '/vehicle'
  end
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<br />

# Getting data from a vehicle

1. Once the backend service or server-side application has the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, it can send requests to a vehicle using the Smartcar API.
   First we'll need to fetch the `vehicle_id`s associated with the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, then fetch vehicle attributes for one of them. After
   receiving the `vehicle_attributes` object, we can render it in a simple table on the page.
   <CodeGroup>
     ```js index.js
     app.get('/vehicle', async function(req, res) {
         // Get the smartcar vehicleIds associated with the access_token
         const { vehicles } = await smartcar.getVehicles(access.accessToken);
         
         // Instantiate the first vehicle in the vehicle id list
         const vehicle = new smartcar.Vehicle(vehicles[0], access.accessToken);

         // Make a request to Smartcar API
         const attributes = await vehicle.attributes();
         res.render('vehicle', {
             info: attributes, 
         });
     });
     ```

     ```python main.py
     @app.route('/vehicle', methods=['GET'])
     def get_vehicle():
         # Access our global variable to retrieve our access tokens
         global access
         
         # Get the smartcar vehicleIds associated with the access_token
         vehicles = smartcar.get_vehicles(access.access_token)
         vehicle_ids = vehicles.vehicles
         
         # Instantiate the first vehicle in the vehicle id list
         vehicle = smartcar.Vehicle(vehicle_ids[0], access.access_token)

         # Make a request to Smartcar API
         attributes = vehicle.attributes()
         return jsonify({
             "make": attributes.make,
             "model": attributes.model,
             "year": attributes.year    
         })

             "year": 2014
         }
         '''
     ```

     ```java Main.java
     get("/vehicle", (req, res) -> {

         // Get the smartcar vehicleIds associated with the access_token
         VehicleIds vehiclesResponse = Smartcar.getVehicles(access);
         String[] vehicleIds = vehiclesResponse.getVehicleIds();
         
         // Instantiate the first vehicle in the vehicle id list
         Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle(vehicleIds[0], access);

         // Make a request to Smartcar API
         VehicleAttributes attributes = vehicle.attributes();
         System.out.println(gson.toJson(attributes));
         
         // {
         //     "id": "36ab27d0-fd9d-4455-823a-ce30af709ffc",

         //     "year": 2014
         // }
         
         res.type("application/json");
         return gson.toJson(attributes);
     })
     ```

     ```ruby index.rb
     get "/vehicle" do
         code = params[:code]

         # Get the smartcar vehicleIds associated with the access_token
         vehicles =  Smartcar::Vehicle.get_vehicle(token: @@token)
         vehicle_ids = vehicles.vehicles
         
         # Instantiate the first vehicle in the vehicle id list
         vehicle = Smartcar::Vehicle.new(token: @@token, id: vehicle_ids.first)  
         
         # Get the vehicle_attributes object for vehicle
         vehicle_attributes = vehicle.attributes
         vehicle_attributes.slice(*%I(id make model year)).to_json
     end

# iOS Tutorial
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/ios

In this tutorial, we will use the iOS SDK to integrate Connect into your application.

<Warning>
  Our frontend SDKs handle getting an authorization code representing a vehicle owner's consent for your application to interact with their vehicle
  for the requested permissions. In order to make requests to a vehicle, please use one of our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks).

  For security, token exchanges and requests to vehicles **should not** be made client side.
</Warning>

<br />

# Overview

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/ios/overview.png" />
</Frame>

<br />

1. The Mobile Application launches a `SafariView` with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with their vehicle credentials and grants the Application access to their vehicle.
2. The `SafariView` is redirected to a specified `REDIRECT_URI` along with an authorization `code`.
   This will be the custom scheme set on the application. The Smartcar iOS SDK receives the authorization `code` in a view listening
   for the specified custom scheme URI, and passes it to the Mobile Application.
3. The Mobile Application sends the received authorization `code` to the Application’s back-end service.
4. The Application sends a request to the Smartcar API. This request contains the authorization code along with the Application’s
   `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
5. In response, Smartcar returns an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
6. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Application can now send requests to the Smartcar API. It can access protected resources and send commands
   to and from the user’s vehicle via the backend service.

# Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup) for a Smartcar account.
* Make a note of your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the **Configuration** section on the Dashboard.
* Add a custom scheme redirect URI to your application configuration.
* Add the `appServer` redirect URI from [Setup step 2](/tutorials/ios#setup) to your application configuration.

<Note>
  For iOS, we require the custom URI scheme to be in the format of `sc` + `clientId` + `://` + `hostname`.
  For now, you can just set it to `sc` + `clientId` + `://exchange`.

  Please see our [Connect Docs](connect/dashboard-config#redirect-uris) for more information.
</Note>

# Setup

1. Clone our repo and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-ios-sdk.git
   $cd getting-started-ios-sdk/tutorial
   $pod install
   $open getting-started-ios-sdk.xcworkspace
   ```
2. Set the following constants in `Constants.swift`. We're setting `appServer` to `http://localhost:8000` to pass the authorization `code` from
   the [Handle the Response](/tutorials/ios#handle-the-response) step later on in the tutorial to our backend.
   ```swift Constants.swift
   struct Constants {
       static let clientId = "<your-client-id>";
       static let appServer = "http://localhost:8000";
   }
   ```

# Build your Connect URL

1. Instantiate a `SmartcarAuth` object in the `viewdidLoad` function of the `ViewController`.
   {/* Smartcar TODO: testMode: true --> mode: "test" and remove the Info box when the SDK gets updated!!! - Travis J.*/}
   ```swift ViewController.swift
   {/*  TODO: Authorization Step 1: Initialize the SmartcarAuth object */}
   appDelegate.smartcar = SmartcarAuth(
       clientId: Constants.clientId,
       redirectUri: "sc\(Constants.clientId)://exchange",
       testMode: true,
       scope: ["required:read_vehicle_info"],
       completion: completion
   )
   ```

<Info>
  The iOS SDK does not support `simulated` mode at this time - only `test` and `live`.
  Feel free to set `testMode: false` where you instantiate your `SmartcarAuth` object to
  connect to a real vehicle.
</Info>

2. The iOS application will launch a `SafariView` with Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for their vehicle’s connected services account
   and grants the application access to their vehicle.

   To launch Connect, we can use the `launchAuthFlow` function that our `SmartcarAuth` object has access to. We can place
   this within the `connectPressed` action function.

   ```swift ViewController.swift
   @IBAction func connectPressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
       {/* TODO: Authorization Step 2: Launch Connect */}
       let smartcar = appDelegate.smartcar!
       smartcar.launchAuthFlow(viewController: self)
   }
   ```

   <br />

# Registering your Custom Scheme

Once a user has authorized the application to access their vehicle, the user is redirected to the `REDIRECT_URI` with an authorization code as a query parameter.

iOS applications use custom URI schemes to intercept calls and launch the relevant application. This is defined within the `Info.plist`.

1. Open up `Info.plist` and click on the grey arrow next to **URL types**.
2. Next, click on the grey arrow next to the `Item 0` dictionary and `URL Schemes` array.
3. Finally, set your `Item 0` string to the redirect URI you set up in the [Prerequisites](/tutorials/ios#prerequisites) section (i.e. 'sc' + clientId).

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/ios/info-plist.png" />
</Frame>

<br />

# Handle the response

1. The iOS application will now receive the request in the `application:(_:open:options:)` function within the AppDelegate.
   ```swift AppDelegate.swift
   func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
       {/* TODO: Authorization Step 3a: Receive the authorization code */}
       window!.rootViewController?.presentedViewController?.dismiss(animated: true , completion: nil)
       smartcar!.handleCallback(with: url)
       
       return true
   }
   ```
2. Using the iOS SDK, the application can receive the code in the `completion callback` passed into the `SmartcarAuth` object.
   ```swift AppDelegate.swift
   func completion(err: Error?, code: String?, state: String?) -> Any {
       {/* TODO: Authorization Step 3b: Receive the authorization code */}
       print(code!);
       {/* prints out the authorization code */}
   }
   ```

# Launching Connect

Build your application in XCode and click on the **Connect your vehicle** button.

<Info>
  This tutorial configures Connect to launch in `test` mode by default.
  In `test` mode, any `username` and `password` is valid for each brand.
</Info>

Smartcar showcases all the permissions your application is asking for - `read_vehicle_info` in this case.
Once you have logged in and accepted the permissions, you should see your authorization `code` printed to your console.

# Getting your first Access Token

After receiving the authorization `code`, your iOS application must exchange it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`. To do so, we can send
the code to a backend service. Let’s assume our backend service contains an endpoint `/exchange` that receives an authorization `code` as a query parameter and exchanges it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

```swift ViewController.swift
// TODO: Obtain an access token
Alamofire.request("\(Constants.appServer)/exchange?code=\(code!)", method: .get)
    .responseJSON {_ in}
```

<Warning>
  Notice that our backend service **does not** return the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.
  This is by design. For security, our frontend should never have access
  to the `ACCESS_TOKEN` and should always be stored in the backend.
</Warning>

# Getting data from a vehicle

Once the backend has the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, it can send requests to a vehicle using the Smartcar API. The iOS app will
have to send a request to the backend service which in turn sends a request to Smartcar. We have to do this because
our frontend **does not** have the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Assuming our backend has a `/vehicle` endpoint that returns the information of a user’s vehicle, we can make this query in
our `completion callback` and segue into another `view` to show the returned  vehicle attributes

```swift ViewController.swift
func completion(err: Error?, code: String?, state: String?) -> Any {

    // send request to exchange auth code for access token
    Alamofire.request("\(Constants.appServer)/exchange?code=\(code!)", method: .get).responseJSON {_ in

        // TODO: Request Step 2: Get vehicle information
        // send request to retrieve the vehicle info
        Alamofire.request("\(Constants.appServer)/vehicle", method: .get).responseJSON { response in
            print(response.result.value!)
            
            if let result = response.result.value {
                let JSON = result as! NSDictionary
                
                let make = JSON.object(forKey: "make")!  as! String
                let model = JSON.object(forKey: "model")!  as! String
                let year = String(JSON.object(forKey: "year")!  as! Int)
                
                let vehicle = "\(year) \(make) \(model)"
                self.vehicleText = vehicle
                
                self.performSegue(withIdentifier: "displayVehicleInfo", sender: self)
            }
        }
    }
    
    return ""
}
```

# Setting up your backend

Now that our frontend is complete, we will need to create a backend service that contains the logic for the `/exchange` and `/vehicle` endpoints.
You can use any of our backend SDKs below to set up the service starting from the **Obtaining an Access Token** step.

<Note>
  When setting up the environment variables for your  backend SDK, make sure to set `REDIRECT_URI` to the custom scheme
  used for this tutorial i.e. `sc + "clientId" + ://exchange`.

# React Tutorial
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/react

In this tutorial, we will use the JavaScript SDK to integrate Connect into your application.

<Warning>
  Our frontend SDKs handle getting an authorization code representing a vehicle owner's consent for your application to interact with their vehicle
  for the requested permissions. In order to make requests to a vehicle, please use one of our [backend SDKs](/api-reference/api-sdks).

  For security, token exchanges and requests to vehicles **should not** be made client side.
</Warning>

<br />

# Overview

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/react/overview.png" />
</Frame>

<br />

1. The Single-Page Application launches a pop-up window with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   It does so by using the Smartcar JavaScript SDK. On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for
   their vehicle’s connected services account and grants the Application access to their vehicle.
2. The user’s browser is redirected to a specified Smartcar-hosted `REDIRECT_URI` - the Smartcar JavaScript SDK redirect page.
3. The Smartcar JavaScript SDK redirect page will receive an authorization `code` as a query parameter. The redirect page will then
   send the code to the Single-Page Application’s `onComplete` callback using the `postMessage` web API. **This step is handled entirely
   by the JavaScript SDK.**
4. The Single-Page Application sends the received authorization `code` to the Application’s backend service.
5. The Application sends a request to the Smartcar API. This request contains the authorization code along with the Application’s
   `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
6. In response, Smartcar returns an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
7. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, the Application can now send requests to the Smartcar API. It can access protected resources and send commands
   to and from the user’s vehicle via the backend service.

# Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup) for a Smartcar account.
* Make a note of your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the **Configuration** section on the Dashboard.
* Add the special JavaScript SDK redirect URI to your application configuration.
* Add the `REACT_APP_SERVER` redirect URI from [Setup step 2.](/tutorials/react#setup) to your application configuration.

<Note>
  To use the JavaScript SDK, we require the special redirect URI to provide a simpler flow to retrieve authorization codes.
  For this tutorial you can use the following:

  `https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=http://localhost:3000`
</Note>

# Setup

1. Clone our repo and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   $git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-javascript-sdk-react.git
   $cd getting-started-javascript-sdk-react/tutorial
   $npm install
   ```
2. Set the following environment variables. We will be setting up a server later for our React front-end to communicate with.
   For now, let’s assume our server is listening on `http://localhost:8000`.
   ```bash
   $export REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
   $export REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI= https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=http://localhost:3000
   $export REACT_APP_SERVER=http://localhost:8000
   ```

<Note>
  Note: If you are using Windows, ensure you are appropriately setting environment variables for your shell.
  Please refer to this post which details how to set environment variables on Windows.
</Note>

# Build your Connect URL

1. Instantiate a `Smartcar` object in the `constructor` of the App component.
   ```js App.jsx
   constructor(props) {
   ...
   // TODO: Authorization Step 1: Initialize the Smartcar object
   this.smartcar = new Smartcar({
       clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
       redirectUri: process.env.REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI,
       scope: ['required:read_vehicle_info'],
       mode: 'test',
       onComplete: this.onComplete,
   });
   }
   ```

<Snippet file="tutorials/info-mode-callout.mdx" />

2. A single-page application will launch a pop-up window with Smartcar Connect to request access to a user’s vehicle.
   On Connect, the user logs in with the username and password for their vehicle’s connected services account and grants
   the application access to their vehicle.

   To launch Connect, we can use the `openDialog` function that our `Smartcar` object has access to. We can place this is
   an `onClick` handler of an HTML button.

   ```js App.jsx
   authorize() {
       // TODO: Authorization Step 2a: Launch Connect
       this.smartcar.openDialog({forcePrompt: true});
   }

   render() {
       // TODO: Authorization Step 2b: Render the Connect component
       return <Connect onClick={this.authorize} />;
   }
   ```

# Handle the response

1. Once a user has authorized the application to access their vehicle, the user is redirected to the `redirect_uri` with an
   authorization code as a query parameter and the pop-up dialog is closed. Using the JavaScript SDK, the frontend can
   receive this `code` in the `onComplete` callback passed into the `Smartcar` object.
   ```js App.jsx
   onComplete(err, code, status) {
       //TODO: Authorization Step 3: Receive the authorization code
       console.log(code);
       //prints out the authorization code
   };
   ```

# Launching Connect

Restart your server, open up your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login). You should be reciderect to Smartcar Connect.

<Info>
  This tutorial configures Connect to launch in `test` mode by default.
  In `test` mode, any `username` and `password` is valid for each brand.
</Info>

Smartcar showcases all the permissions your application is asking for - `read_vehicle_info` in this case.
Once you have logged in and accepted the permissions, you should see your authorization `code` printed to your console.

# Getting your first access token

After receiving the authorization code, the React application must exchange it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`. To do so, we can send
the code to the backend service which we will implement in a bit. Until then, let’s assume our backend service contains
an endpoint `/exchange` that receives an authorization code as a query parameter and exchanges it for an `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

We can add this logic in our `onComplete` callback

```js App.jsx
onComplete(err, code, status) {
  // TODO: Request Step 1: Obtain an access token
  return axios
    .get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER}/exchange?code=${code}`);
}

```

# Getting data from a vehicle

Once the back-end has the `ACCESS_TOKEN`, it can send requests to a vehicle using the Smartcar API. The React app will
have to send a request to the backend service which in turn sends a request to Smartcar. We have to do this because
our frontend does not have the `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Assuming our backend has a `/vehicle` endpoint that returns the information of a user’s vehicle, we can make this query in
our `completion callback` and and set the state of the React app with the returned vehicle attributes.

```js App.jsx
onComplete(err, code, status) {
  // TODO: Request Step 2a: Get vehicle information
  return axios
    .get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER}/exchange?code=${code}`)
    .then(_ => {
      return axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER}/vehicle`);
    })
    .then(res => {
      this.setState({vehicle: res.data});
    });
}

```

Now that we have the vehicle attributes, we can render a simple Vehicle component that shows the vehicle attributes in a table.

```js App.jsx
render() {
  // TODO: Request Step 2b: Get vehicle information
  return Object.keys(this.state.vehicle).length !== 0 ? (
    <Vehicle info={this.state.vehicle} />
  ) : (
    <Connect onClick={this.authorize} />
  );
}

# Setting up your backend

Now that our frontend is complete, we will need to create a backend service that contains the logic for the `/exchange` and `/vehicle` endpoints.
You can use any of our backend SDKs below to set up the service starting from the **Obtaining an access token** step.

<Note>
  When setting up the environment variables for your  backend SDK, make sure to set `REDIRECT_URI` to the custom scheme
  used for this tutorial i.e. `https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=http://localhost:3000`.

# Diagnostic Webhooks
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/webhooks-diagnostic

Diagnostic webhooks send events whenever a state change occurs within the vehicle's Health Status or a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is reported

## Early Access

Diagnostic webhooks are available in early access throughout December 2024 - January 2025 for organizations with Enterprise plans with Smartcar.

## Brand Support

Diagnostics provide visibility into Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) for GM vehicles and System Status information for GM and FCA vehicles.

## Supported Events

[Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)](https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/get-dtcs), which are 5-digit codes that indicate the component and fault type. DTC webhooks will send events for each active DTC including a timestamp it became active. A webhook event will also trigger when a DTC is no longer active.

[System Status](https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/get-system-status), where an OEM application’s “Vehicle Health” or “System Health” reports provide a list of components and their health status. System Status webhooks will send events whenever a system reports a change from Healthy to Alert and vice-versa. A [list of diagnostic systems](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/diagnostic-systems) is available in our Help Center.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial it is recommended to have the following in place:

* To receive webhooks you’ll need to set up a callback URI on your server.

* To [**subscribe**](https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe-webhook) a vehicle you’ll want to have [**Connect**](https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/dashboard-config) integrated into your application.

## Setting up a Diagnostic Webhook

Navigate to **Webhooks** from the Smartcar Dashboard, select **+ Add webhook** and select **Event-based** from the Webhooks config wizard.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/tutorials/diagnostic-webhooks/add-webhook.png" />
</Frame>

Name your webhook and specify a `callback URI`. Your `callback URI` is where Smartcar will send payloads from vehicles connected to your webhook. Click **Next**.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/tutorials/diagnostic-webhooks/name-webhook.png" />
</Frame>

Select which event types you wish to receive from System Status or Diagnostic Trouble Codes and hit Add. To receive both event types, create a second webhook.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/tutorials/diagnostic-webhooks/configure-webhook.png" />
</Frame>

Hit **Add** when ready.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/tutorials/diagnostic-webhooks/confirm-webhook.png" />
</Frame>

<br />

After adding your webhook, you’ll need to verify your callback URI. This is to ensure Smartcar is sending data to the correct place!

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/tutorials/diagnostic-webhooks/verify-webhook.png" />
</Frame>

Please see our API reference on how to [verify a webhook](/api-reference/webhooks/callback-verification), or **Part II** on [this blog post](https://smartcar.com/blog/how-to-use-scheduled-webhooks#-part-ii-verify-webhook) for a more in depth guide.

## Subscribing vehicles to a webhook

Now you’ve got your webhook set up, you can subscribe vehicles to start getting data. If you haven’t done so already, please set up [Connect](http://localhost:3000/connect/dashboard-config) for your application.

After going through Connect and receiving your initial `access_token`, you’ll first want to hit the [All Vehicles](/api-reference/all-vehicles) endpoint to fetch the Smartcar `vehicle_ids` of the authorized vehicles.

<CodeGroup>
  <Snippet file="api-reference/core-sdk-methods/all-vehicles.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

<br />

With your `access_token` and `webhook_id` you can hit the [Subscribe](/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe-webhook) endpoint for each `vehicle_id` to start receiving data.

  <Accordion title="How often will I get data?">
    Smartcar will handle regular polling for diagnostic events to provide them as quickly as possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the same callback URI for all my webhooks?">
    Yes! You can distinguish between webhook types based on the `eventName` field. Dynamic Webhooks will have `eventName` set to `dynamic`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my webhook destination goes down temporarily?">
    Smartcar will attempt to resend payloads with an exponential backoff. Once your server is back online you'll continue to receive data from the vehicles.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I've stopped receiving events">
    * Once a webhook is configured and a vehicle is subscrbied, we’ll begin sending data to your Callback URI.
      We’ll expect a 2xx response to each. In the event that we don’t receive a 2xx response, we’ll retry 6 times with exponential backoff.
      **If we continue not to receive a successful response, we’ll automatically disable your webhook.**

    * If you haven't made any major changes to your callback URI, commonly our request payload may have hit the request size limit for you server.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a vehicle encounters an error? Will you retry?">
    Smartcar will attempt to get data from the vehicle with retries. However if we are unable to we'll return the relevant error response in the payload for that vehicle.

    For example, if a vehicle owner changes the credentials to their connected services account we'll return a [CONNECT\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT:AUTHENTICATION\_FAILED](/errors/api-errors/connected-services-account-errors#authentication-failed) error prompting you to have the vehicle owner go through Connect again to reauthenticate their vehicle.

# Dynamic Webhooks (Early Access)
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/webhooks-dynamic

Dynamic webhooks make it incredibly easy to receive data from a vehicle at the optimal frequency supported by the OEM. Specifically, once a certain condition is met, you will be able to receive data more frequently from the vehicle to stay up-to-date with the state of the vehicle when it matters most to you.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial it is recommended to have the following in place:

* To receive webhooks you’ll need to set up a callback URI on your server.
* To [**subscribe**](https://smartcar.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe-webhook) a vehicle you’ll want to have [**Connect**](https://smartcar.com/docs/connect/dashboard-config) integrated into your application.

## Setting up a Dynamic Webhook

Navigate to **Webhooks** from the Smartcar Dashboard, select **+ Add webhook** and select **Dynamic** from the Webhooks config wizard.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/tutorials/dynamic-webhooks/add-webhook.png" />
</Frame>

Name your webhook and specify a `callback URI`. Your `callback URI` is where Smartcar will send payloads from vehicles connected to your webhook. Click **Next**.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/tutorials/dynamic-webhooks/name-webhook.png" />
</Frame>

Confirm everything looks good and hit **Add**.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/tutorials/dynamic-webhooks/confirm-webhook.png" />
</Frame>

<br />

<Info>
  Currently Dynamic Webhooks only support returning data from the
  [location](/api-reference/get-location),
  [charge](/api-reference/evs/get-charge-status), and
  [battery](/api-reference/evs/get-battery-level) endpoints. Changes in data frequency
  are only supported based on the plugged in state for EVs.
</Info>

After adding your webhook, you’ll need to verify your callback URI. This is to ensure Smartcar is sending data to the correct place!

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often will I get data?">
    By default Smartcar will deliver data every hour from the time a vehicle is subscribed. From that point on, once we detect the relevant state changes we'll increase this to every 30 minutes, dropping back down to hourly once the state returns to what it was.

    Where more frequent data delivery is supported by an OEM, Smartcar will deliver data at those speeds. Please reach out to your Solutions Architect for more information.

# Scheduled Webhooks
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/tutorials/webhooks-scheduled

Scheduled webhooks make it incredibly easy to receive vehicle data on a cadence of your choosing. You can set up a webhook for any Smartcar endpoint that allows you to read data from a vehicle.

This tutorial is split into four steps:

1.  Creating your webhook
2.  Verifying your callback URI
3.  Confirmation with a test payload
4.  Subscribing your first vehicle

# Prerequisites

For this tutorial it is recommended to have the following in place:

*   To receive webhooks you'll need to set up a callback URI on your server.
*   To [subscribe](/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe-webhook) a vehicle you'll want to have [Connect](/connect/dashboard-config) set up.

# Creating your first webhook

1.  Navigate to the **Webhooks** section of Dashboard and hit **+ Add Webhook**.
2.  Next, name your webhook, enter in your callback URI, and select **Scheduled** as the type.
    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/webhooks-create-scheduled.png" />
    </Frame>
3.  After selecting the type, you'll need to:
    *   set how often you want receive data
    *   select which endpoints you want to receive data from
    *   select the units you want to receive data
    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/webhooks-scheduled-settings.png" />
    </Frame>
4.  Once you're happy with the configuration, hit **Add Webhook** and move on to verifying your callback URI.

# Verifying your callback URI

After adding your webhook, you'll be prompted to verify it. After hitting **Verify this webhook** Smartcar will post a challenge request
to your callback URI to ensure we're sending payloads to the correct place.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/webhooks-scheduled-verify.png" />
</Frame>

See the [callback verification](/api-reference/webhooks/callback-verification) section on our API Reference for insructions on how to format your response.

# Confirmation with a test payload

Once verified you can send a test payload to your callback URI. Payloads from vehicles will have `eventName` set to `scheduled`.

<Note>
  The `mode` field will reflect the type of vehicle you've subscribed - either `live`, `test` or `simulated`.

If you haven't done so already, please set up the [Connect](connect/dashboard-config) for your application.

After receiving your initial `ACCESS_TOKEN` from the [auth code exchange](connect/auth-code-exchange) step for Connect,
you'll first want to hit the [All Vehicles](/api-reference/management/all-vehicles) endpoint to fetch the Smartcar
`vehicle_id`s of the authorized vehicles.

<CodeGroup>
  <Snippet file="api-reference/core-sdk-methods/all-vehicles.mdx" />
</CodeGroup>

<br />

With your `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `WEBHOOK_ID` you can hit the [Subscribe](/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe-webhook)
endpoint for each `vehicle_id` to start receiving data.

# FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When will I receive my first scheduled webhook?">
    Data will post to the endpoint depending on your selected cadence. For example:

    *   if a car is subscribed to an hourly interval webhook at 15:45 UTC, you'll get start to get data after 16:00UTC.
    *   if a car is subscribed to a monthly interval, we'll process the webhooks at 00:00UTC for the selected day.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use an Event Based webhook to receive scheduled webhooks?">
    No, you'll need to set up a webhook for each webhook type.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the same callback URI for my webhooks?">
    Yes! You can distinguish between webhook types based on the `eventName` field - `scheduled` or `eventBased`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I've stopped receiving events">
    *   Once a webhook is configured, we’ll begin sending events to your Callback URI on the cadence that you’ve chosen.
        We’ll expect a 2xx response to each. In the event that we don’t receive a 2xx response, we’ll retry 5 times over the next 10 minutes.
        **If we continue not to receive a successful response, we’ll automatically disable your webhook.**
    *   Check that your server didn't experience down time for more than 10 minutes recently resulting in 2XX responses not being sent back to Smartcar.
    *   If you haven't made any major changes to your callback URI, commonly our request payload may have hit the request size limit for you server.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I always receive payloads in line with my configured cadence?">
    While we aim for 1 to 5 minutes after your selected cadence, the delivery time largely depends on the number of vehicles you have subscribed as
    well as the average OEM latency. Smartcar will try to fulfill requests for your webhook within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. If we were unable
    to fulfill a request during that time, we'll try again over the course of subsequent 15 minute intervals and post them to your webhook.

# Testing with Postman
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/getting-started/using-vs-with-postman

In this guide we'll go over how to use Vehicle Simulator to test out Smartcar using Postman.

## What is Postman?

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIs - faster.
You’ll need a few things to start making API calls with Smartcar and Postman:

* [A Postman Account](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.postman.co%2Fbuild)
* [Smartcar’s Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/smartcar/workspace/smartcar-api/collection/13172949-37efba9a-c68c-4f45-b123-af9154d7a0a6?action=share\&creator=9829117)
* [A Smartcar Developer Account](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup)

## Configuring the Connect flow in Postman

1. Install the latest [Postman app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and log in
2. Import the [Smartcar collection](https://www.postman.com/smartcar/workspace/smartcar-api/collection/13172949-37efba9a-c68c-4f45-b123-af9154d7a0a6?action=share\&creator=9829117) into your local Postman workspace. Hit Import.
3. Click Link, paste in [the link](https://www.postman.com/smartcar/workspace/smartcar-api/collection/13172949-37efba9a-c68c-4f45-b123-af9154d7a0a6?action=share\&creator=9829117) to the collection and hit Continue.
4. On the next screen, hit Import.

## Smartcar Application Configuration

If you haven’t already signed up for a Smartcar Developer account, you can do so from this [**signup link**](https://dashboard.smartcar.com/signup).

* Grab your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Configuration page after you sign in, and copy them to someplace secure. You’ll need those tokens a little later in this setup.
* Under the Credentials tab for your application, you’ll need to add the following Redirect URIs. This will ensure that Smartcar Connect exits successfully with both Postman’s Native and Web clients.

```
https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback 
http://localhost:8000/exchange
```

</Frame>

Through the Connect flow, you’re able to get consent from vehicle owners to connect their vehicle to your application. Postman provides an easy way to manage oAuth 2.0 flows under the Authorization tab of a Collection. Set up the Configuration Options for either a live or simulated vehicle.

Continue through the Connect flow, select the brand of your simulated vehicle and enter in the credentials you were issued for your simulated vehicle.
After accepting the permissions you’ll be met with the following screen:

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/help-center/guide-postman/connect2.png" />
</Frame>

Hit Use Token. You should see Access Token under Current Token populate with the access\_token from the popup. Using this access\_token you can make API
requests to Smartcar's API.

</Frame>

<br />

<Warning>
  Access tokens are only valid for two hours. If you want to make API requests after it has expired, you'll need to generate a
  new one by stepping through the Connect Flow again, or through a [token refresh](/api-reference/authorization/token-refresh).
</Warning>

## Making an API request

<Tip>
  Thanks to Postman, requests in the collection will inherit the `access_token` from the OAuth 2.0 Authorization flow we went through in the steps above.
</Tip>

In order to make API requests, we’ll need to first get a Smartcar `vehicle Id`. A `vehicle Id` is a unique identifier for a vehicle on Smartcar’s platform.

This can be done with the `All Vehicles` request. Making this request will assign the `vehicle Id` to the `{{vehicle_id}}` variable for other requests in the Collection.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/help-center/guide-postman/req1.png" />
</Frame>

<br />

Now that you've got a vehicle Id, you can make a request to other endpoints. Hitting Vehicle Info, we can see the MMY of the vehicle.

<Frame type="simple">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/smartcar-docs/images/help-center/guide-postman/req2.png" />

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I’m getting an Invalid Credentials error in the Connect flow">
    * Check that you’re launching Connect in simulated mode
    * If you’re still running in to an error make sure you’ve selected a country that matches the region you selected for your simulated vehicle.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I’m getting a 403 - Permission error on API requests">
    * Check that the vehicle you’ve created supports the endpoint. Select View Estimated Latencies to see a list of endpoints supported for the vehicle.
    * If you’re still running into the error, check that you’ve requested the appropriate permission in the scope parameter of the Connect URL.

    <Tip>
      You can always check the `/permissions` endpoint to see what endpoints you have access to.

# Smartcar Usage Limits
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/api-limits

Learn about limits you may encounter when using Smartcar.

## Overview

There are several types of limits that govern your use of Smartcar. The nature of telematics requires us to carefully manage vehicle connections and traffic to ensure the stability of our platform and those of our upstream providers.

There are two major types of limits - **Billing Limits** and **Operational Rate Limits**.

# Billing Limits

### [BILLING : VEHICLE\_REQUEST\_LIMIT](/errors/api-errors/billing-errors#vehicle-request-limit)

Your Smartcar plan specifies a maximum number of API calls you are permitted to make to each single vehicle in a given month. If you exceed this limit, you will receive the `VEHICLE_REQUEST_LIMIT` error.

For example: you have been allocated 500 API calls per vehicle per month, but you made the 501<sup>st</sup> call to a single vehicle during the billing period.

**This limit can be changed.** If you require more calls per vehicle per month, contact [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) or your Account Manager and we can work with you to understand your options.

### [BILLING : VEHICLE\_LIMIT](/errors/api-errors/billing-errors#vehicle-request-limit)

Your Smartcar plan specifies a maximum number of vehicles that you may have connected at any one time. This limit applies to vehicle connections, and is separate from the limit regarding the number of API calls to those vehicles. If you receive this error, you have exceeded your maximum number of connected vehicles.

**This limit can be changed.** Reach out to [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) or your Account Manager to discuss your options.

# Operational Rate Limits

### [RATE\_LIMIT : SMARTCAR\_API](/errors/api-errors/rate-limit-errors#smartcar-api)

Smartcar limits the total number of requests a single application can make over a given period of time to ensure platform stability for all customers. The Smartcar API Limit is defined as a "bucket" of requests that refills at a constant rate over time.

The default Smartcar API Limit is a **bucket of 120 requests that refills at a rate of 2 requests per minute.**

If you receive a `RATE_LIMIT:SMARTCAR_API` response, your application has exceeded this limit. You should implement an exponential backoff strategy when retrying requests.

**This limit can be changed.** Reach out to [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) or your Account Manager to discuss your options.

### [RATE\_LIMIT : VEHICLE](/errors/api-errors/rate-limit-errors#vehicle)

Sending telematics requests to a vehicle causes it to wake up from its sleep state and consume energy and data resources. Excessive requests to a single vehicle can result in:

* EV battery drain
* 12 volt battery drain
* `UPSTREAM:RATE_LIMIT` errors that prevent you from making requests for a longer period of time

Smartcar enforces a per-vehicle rate limit that governs the rate of requests to a single vehicle and mitigates these potential issues. These limits can differ based on the vehicle manufacturer and a number of other factors, and are set by Smartcar to ensure consistent and timely data can be retrieved from vehicles.

**This limit cannot be changed.** If you receive this response, refer to the `retry-after` header (returned as seconds) for when to retry the request.

### [UPSTREAM : RATE\_LIMIT](/errors/api-errors/upstream-errors#rate-limit)

Vehicle manufacturers sometimes impose rate limits on requests to vehicles. The Smartcar Vehicle Rate Limit will generally prevent those limits from being reached, but outside requests from other providers may cause the upstream limit to be exceeded. If the OEM upstream rate limit is exceeded, you will receive `UPSTREAM:RATE_LIMIT` from the Smartcar API for the affected vehicle until the limit is reset.

**This limit cannot be changed.** Smartcar cannot control rate limits imposed by our upstream providers. If you consistently receive this response for a single vehicle, reach out to [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) and we can investigate.


# Brand Quirks
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/brand-quirks

Brand specific quirks to keep in mind while building out your application.

## Acura

### Ignition On

Depending on model year, certain Acura vehicles do not return data when the ignition/engine is on.

### Sleep State

Most Acuras will go into a sleep state after about a week of inactivity,

## Audi

### Primary Key User

In order to have access to all vehicle functionality the account that connects to Smartcar will need to be flagged as a Key User by Audi.

## BMW/MINI

### CONNECTED\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT - SUBSCRIPTION errors

Smartcar API will throw a CONNECTED\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT - SUBSCRIPTION when the data we receive from the vehicle is older than a month as this normally indicates a subscription issue.

## Ford/Lincoln

### Authentication

Connecting Ford vehicles requires the use of one of our mobile SDKs. We currently offer SDKs for iOS, Android, and Flutter. Smartcar's Connect SDKs will redirect to Ford’s site to handle the authentication process when the user logs in.

**Authentication via non-mobile platforms such as web browsers is not supported at this time**. See [Connect SDKs](/docs/connect/connect-sdks) for our latest SDKs.

## GM (Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC)

### VEHICLE\_STATE - ASLEEP errors

After 3-4 days of no activity, GM vehicles will enter a deep sleep state at which point they will no longer respond to API requests to preserve their 12v battery. In order to get data from the vehicle again, the car will need to go through an ignition cycle.

### UPSTREAM - RATE\_LIMIT errors

In order to avoid hitting UPSTREAM - RATE\_LIMIT errors use batch requests and ping no more than once every 30 minutes. Use of the OEM app also counts towards the rate limit.

## Hyundai/Kia

### Lock/Unlock Support for Hyundai US vehicles.

Hyundai has limitations in place that limit how many lock/unlock requests can be made in a given period. As a result, we want to avoid the case where a user accidentally makes too many lock/unlock requests, potentially blocking them from using an app until Hyundai’s rate limit for the vehicle has reset.

### Polling Limitations

Hyundai/Kia vehicles have a limitation where only 20 requests can be made in a 24 hour period. Smartcar allows one requests every 72 minutes to go to the vehicle directly. All other requests will be sent to the OEM's cloud which may be updated after events such as:

* Every 10% of SoC while charging
* 5 minutes after ignition off
* Vehicle doors are left unlocked for 5 minutes
* After a command successfully completes
* Whenever charging stops

## Nissan

### “Vehicle has been found” MyNISSAN notifications

Vehicle owners may receive a notification from the MyNISSAN app stating “Success! We found the location of your vehicle. Check the map for the location of your YYYY Model.” every time the location endpoint is hit.

The app appears to have an option to edit notifications, but as of Feb 2024 they are not available in the app. Notifications may need to be turned off at the iOS/Android level by the vehicle owner.

## PSA Group (Citroen, DS, Opel, Peugeot, Vauxhall)

### Requesting control\_charge permissions

If you request control\_charge permissions for PSA EVs, upon login owners will be presented with a PIN and MFA screen in Connect upon submitting their credentials. They will need to have set this up on their OEMs application in order to grant your application this permission.

## Rivian

### MFA

If MFA is enabled the vehicle owner will need to re-authorize via Connect about every 2 weeks.

## Tesla

### Remote Access

It may take a few hours or up to a full day for the REMOTE\_ACCESS\_DISABLED errors to subside after remote access is enabled.

### Charge Billing Records

In order to retrieve charge billing records, the main Tesla account must connect the vehicle, as driver profiles do not have access to this data.

### Virtual Key

Tesla now requires virtual keys for 3rd-party applications in order to issue commands for the following models:

* All Cybertrucks, Model 3 and Model Y
* 2021+ Model S and X

## Toyota/Lexus

### Prius Prime - Location

Due to very low reliability/accuracy of the location endpoint for Prius Primes, we currently do not support that endpoint for the Prius Prime vehicles specifically. The regular Prius vehicle **do** support location.

## Volkswagen

### Control charge limits

Volkswagen only allows 15 charge commands (start/stop charge) before the vehicle needs to be driven again in order to start responding to start/stop requests.

### CONNECTED\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT errors on lock/unlock commands

In addition to verifying the VW account with the activation code, some cars will need to undergo the VW Ident Process before you can access remote lock/unlock functionality. This involves contacting the dealership to verify your ownership of the vehicle.

### Missing Subscription (European VWs)

Upon purchasing (or activating the free trial), VW needs to review the request. You will get an email confirmation once they've cleared everything on their side.

### Primary Driver Status

In order to fully interact with Smartcar, the credentials need to be flagged as the primary driver. You'll need to tap the "become primary driver" flow in the VW app. Depending on the model, this may require you to be in the car to interact with the infotainment system.

## Volvo

### Lock/unlock commands

Volvo is an outlier regarding how unlock requests are processed. After initiating the request, after about 10 seconds you'll need to open the trunk (boot) to successfully complete the request. You'll know the car is ready to unlock the trunk as the hazard lights will flash. We recommend adding a notification for Volvos as part of the request loading animation to inform the user of this process.

### Phone number username

Smartcar Connect currently checks for an email format, as such phone number usernames cannot be used. The owner will need to add their email to their Volvo account via the web portal.

### Compatibility

Some models are not compatible because the device needs to be physically in the vehicle during authentication, which Connect doesn’t support at the moment:

* 2021+: XC40 Recharge
* 2022+: S90, S90 Recharge, V90, V90 Recharge, V90 Cross Country, XC60, XC60 Recharge, C40 Recharge
* 2023+: All models with the exception of the XC40

Even if the vehicle has been connected to and shows up in the Volvo app, if they go through Connect the account will present as if there are no vehicles on the account.

## Notes

### Audi

* Owners will need to ensure they're the Primary or Key user for the vehicle connected to their account in order to access all Smartcar functionality.

### Ford and Lincoln

* Owners that use a username to login to their connected services app will need to migrate to using their email address under account settings in their Ford Pass or Lincoln Way portal.

### Onstar

* Chevy Bolts MY 2020+ come with the **EV Mobile Command** service included for 5 years with the purchase of a new vehicle. Location data is not included in the package. Bolt owners will need to also subscribe to **Remote Access** to be able to get access to location data.
* For all other OnStar accounts, we require the modern **Remote Access** plan as our base subscription. This plan comes with the **Vehicle Status** feature set, which is what enables our remote access to data from cars.
  More information can be found [in this PDF](https://my.chevrolet.com/content/dam/gmownercenter/gmna/dynamic/onstar/comparePlans/nbm/OC_Compare-Plans-Chevy.pdf).
* There are certain legacy OnStar accounts floating around with similar names. A good check on whether a customer has the correct plan or not is the ability to view vehicle information like fuel level, EV battery level, odometer, or tire pressure from within their vehicle’s mobile app.

### Nissan US

* Convenience features are included as part of the Premium package.

### Toyota

* The Remote Connect subscription is tied to the audio package purchased with the vehicle. Compatible audio package availability is determined based on the trim of the vehicle model and varies model year to model year.
  Toyota provides PDFs for Remote Connect availability [here](https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/#:~:text=Learn%20about%20your%20Connected%20Services).

### Uconnect

* For all Uconnect accounts, we require the ability to interact with vehicle information through the UConnect portal
* A Uconnect account may have access to Mopar, but not all Mopar accounts have access to UConnect. If a user can see information in Mopar but not UConnect, they’ll need to reach out to UConnect support to set up the right UConnect plan for their vehicle.
* 2021+ Jeeps have their own connected service - Jeep Connect
* 2022+ Rams have their own connected service - Ram Connect
* 2022+ Jeep Wagoneers have their own connected service - Wagoneer Connect
* Canada has limited support listed [here](https://www.driveuconnect.ca/en/sirius-xm-guardian-vehicles)

### Volkswagen ID Series

* Model year 2021 and certain 2022 Volkswagen ID vehicles require an upgrade to vehicle software version 3 which will allow you to get location and odometer data. This is a requirement for both US and European vehicles.

### Volvo

The following models are not currently compatible with Smartcar:

* 2021+ : XC40 Recharge
* 2022+ : S90, S90 Recharge, V90, V90 Recharge, V90 Cross Country, XC60, XC60 Recharge
* 2023+ : All models with the exception of the XC40

# Early Access
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/early-access

Understand Smartcar's approach to Early Access features.

Early Access is a program that allows developers to test and integrate new Smartcar features before they are fully released. Early Access refers to a phase where certain features are made available for testing and feedback prior to general availability. These features are functional but may still be under development or refinement.

## Benefits of Early Access

Participating in Early Access allows developers to get a head start on integrating new features, a chance to influence the feature in development through feedback and help Smartcar ensure your app’s needs are met.

## Considerations for Early Access

When working with Early Access features, keep in mind that features may change before final release. As such, extra caution is advised when using these features in production environments.

## How to Participate

If you would like to get involved in testing an Early Access feature, contact your Account Manager or our [Support](support@smartcar.com) team for guidance.


# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/faqs



Below you'll find answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about Smartcar.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Smartcar make apps?">
    Smartcar does not build applications ourselves. Rather, we provide the building blocks that our customers need in order to build applications for a variety of use cases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a connected services account?">
    Yes. For instance, if you own a VW, you will need to have Car-Net activated in the US or WeConnect in Europe. You can read more about connected service subscriptions [here](/help/brand-subscriptions).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What countries does Smartcar work in?">
    Take a look at our [Global Compatibility page](https://smartcar.com/global/) for the latest information on where Smartcar works.

    Smartcar is always expanding and working hard to ensure supported countries are stable and reliable. If your country is not currently supported, but you think we'll be a good fit for your use case, [schedule a demo](https://smartcar.com/demo/) and let's see how we can help you!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which languages does Smartcar support?">
    [Smartcar Connect](/connect/what-is-connect) is available in English, Danish, German, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Latin America), French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, and Swedish providing vehicle owners a native experience as they onboard vehicles to your platform.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How fresh is my data?">
    Smartcar will always try to pull the latest data point from any given vehicle. Each API response includes an [sc-data-age header](https://smartcar.com/docs/api#response-headers) that will contain the timestamp of when that data was last saved.

    Although each OEM saves data at different times, the data age header should not be older than the last time the vehicle was used.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many cars is Smartcar compatible with?">
    <Tip>
      For a list of compatible vehicles, visit [our website](https://smartcar.com/product/compatible-vehicles/).
    </Tip>

    Smartcar is compatible with **161 million vehicles** across the US, Canada and Europe.

    **United States** <br />
    Smartcar is compatible with **29 car brands** in the United States.

    **Europe** <br />
    Smartcar is compatible with **19 car brands** in Europe.

    **Canada** <br />
    Smartcar is compatible with **21 car brands** in Canada.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why isn't my car supported?">
    **If your make isn't supported...**

    We work hard to ensure that supported brands are stable and reliable, which takes time. If you don't see your make on our [compatibility page](https://smartcar.com/product/compatible-vehicles/) but you would like it to be, reach out to [support@smartcar.com](mailto:support@smartcar.com) to see how you can help speed up the process!

    **If we support your make, but not your model...**

    We might just need to do some additional testing. Sign up to our [research fleet](https://smartcar.com/research-fleet) and we'll reach out to see what we can do for you!

    **If we support your make, model, but not your year...**

    The majority of automakers only started adding internet connectivity to their cars around 2014. If you're able to access your car through a smartphone application and believe it should be supported, reach out to us and we'll be happy to take a look.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smartcar versus Aftermarket Hardware">
    While on-board diagnostics dongles are versatile and useful for tracking and diagnostics of many kinds, they are far from ideal when it comes to mileage verification.
    They can be inaccurate, inconvenient, expensive and unreliable.Smartcar is only one example of a pure software alternative that uses API technology to offer the perfect
    mileage verification solution to auto insurance companies. Compared with traditional OBD-II devices, our API is accurate, cost efficient and tamper-resistant.

    You can read more about why using our API is a great choice on our [blog](https://smartcar.com/blog/obd-mileage-verification/).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do I see requests that resulted in a 460 status code with different error codes and error types on the Smartcar Dashboard?">
    In the event that we recieve a response from the OEM after the connection is closed, we will show the error code and error type we would have responded with on the Dashboard if the connection had been kept open.
  </Accordion>

This page has information regarding Smartcar's upgraded Tesla integration.

## What's changing for my integration?

### For new developers

If you're on an **Enterprise** or **Scale** plan, please reach out to your Account Manager or
Solutions Architect for information on setting up your own Virtual Key.

**Free** and **Build** customers can get started with the default Virtual Key and no
additional configuration.

### For existing developers

Please see the section that applies to your situation [here](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/whats-new#for-existing-developers).

## What is a Virtual Key?

A virtual key is a digital access method required by Tesla for third-party
applications to receive vehicle data and issue commands to Tesla vehicles.
Please see [this
section](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#adding-a-virtual-key)
for more information.

## Where can I find my Virtual Key?

The Virtual Key URL for your application will be sent back along with the
authorization code after a user completes the Connect flow.

### Handling the new redirect parameter

After going through the new Connect flow, we'll send back a URL pointing to a Virtual Key along with the `code`:

```http Success
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://example.com/home?
code=90abecb6-e7ab-4b85-864a-e1c8bf67f2ad
&virtual_key_url=https://www.tesla.com/_ak/smartcar.com
```

<Info>
  This new param will **not** break existing HTTP client integrations or older SDK versions. Update to the latest version to receive the URL in the Connect `onComplete` for our Frontend SDKs.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Android SDK">
    ```java
    handleResponse(SmartcarResponse smartcarResponse) {
        // handle code
        // retrieve virtualKeyUrl
        String virtualKeyUrl = smartcarResponse.getVirtualKeyUrl()
    } 
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JavaScript SDK">
    ```swift
    onComplete: function(err, code, state, virtualKeyUrl) {
       // handle code
       // send virtualKeyUrl to backend, for example
       api.post('/backend-route', { virtualKeyUrl });
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="🚨 iOS SDK - Breaking Change">
    The the completion handler signature is different with the **latest version**. In the `completionHandler`, the order of arguments is now `code: String?, state: String?, virtualKeyUrl: String?, err: AuthorizationError?`<br />

    ```swift
    func completionHandler(
            code: String?, state: String?, virtualKeyUrl: String?, 
            err: AuthorizationError?,) -> Void {
            ...
        }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Backend SDKs">
    No changes. Simply reference the new parameter from our `POST` back to your redirect URI - `virtual_key_url`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding a Virtual Key

This process should take place after the Connect flow when a user has returned
to your application.

The Virtual Key is a URL in the form:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Free or Build">
    ```
    https://www.tesla.com/_ak/smartcar.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Scale or Enterprise">
    ```
    https://www.tesla.com/_ak/{{custom_subdomain}}.app.car
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After prompting your your users to open the link, depending on their
device, they will need to do the following:

<Tip>
  Adding a Virtual Key will need to be done after a user has granted your application access to their Tesla account in the Connect flow.

  Please see our [FAQs](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/faqs#can-owner-and-driver-accounts-authorize-access-with-smartcar-through-connect) for details on adding a virtual key for accounts with multiple vehicles and different account types.

## Do all vehicles need a virtual key?

2020 and earlier Model S and X **will not** require a virtual key to keep
working at this time. Smartcar will poll these vehicles in the background every
5 minutes for data. These requests **will not** wake the vehicle.

## What if a streaming capable vehicle does not have a virtual key installed?

If a vehicle is streaming capable and does not yet have a virtual key installed,
requests to the vehicle will be limited to 1 request every 8 hours for data. These requests **will
not** wake the vehicle.

## Updating access with Tesla

You can use either of the following URLs to prompt users for more Tesla
permissions in the event you need additional access from the
vehicle owner due to:

* A [PERMISSION](/errors/api-errors/permission-errors) error from API

* A [CONNECTED\_SERVICES\_ACCOUNT:PERMISSION](/errors/api-errors/connected-services-account-errors#permission) error from API

* Needing access to an endpoint out of scope for your existing permissions

If one or more of the Smartcar scopes you pass map to a new Tesla permission(s)
for the account, the user will be prompted to update access after they log in
with Tesla.

## Requiring Tesla Permissions

To ensure users select the necessary permissions with Tesla before
being able to connect their vehicle via Smartcar, please append the `required:`
prefix to Smartcar scopes in your Connect URL e.g. `required:read_location`.

As a result if they do not select the necessary permissions with Tesla, they will see the
following screen and be prompted to return to Tesla to update their permissions.

</Frame>

## Permission Mappings

Tesla provides a limited set of permissions. To ensure vehicle data is shared only with explicit consent, Smartcar has mapped Tesla’s permissions into its existing more granular options. For example, granting access to “vehicle commands” in a Tesla account allows an application to start or stop charging, lock or unlock doors, enable or disable Sentry Mode, and more. Smartcar separates these permissions so that applications must request access to control charging separately from access to vehicle security, control navigation, etc. Smartcar does not use or share vehicle data beyond the permissions listed in this table. An application with the ability to control the charge status of a vehicle, does not have access to control other aspects of the car unless explictly requested and granted by a vehicle owner.

| Smartcar Permission          | Tesla Permission                                    |

# Tesla FAQs
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/faqs

FAQs on our new Tesla integration. For an overview of the changes see [this page](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/whats-new).

#### What happens if I connect to one of my applications with the legacy flow and another with the new flow?

As long as you have access to the same set of permissions on Tesla’s side and have added our virtual key there will not be any conflicts while the legacy API is active.

#### If my users have more than one Tesla on their account, will they need to add the virtual key to all of their vehicles?

Yes. You will need to add our virtual key to each vehicle on the Tesla account.

#### What happens if I issue a command but Smartcar’s virtual key hasn’t been added to the vehicle?

We will throw a `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT:VIRTUAL_KEY_REQUIRED` error.

## Do all vehicles need a virtual key?

2020 and earlier Model S and X **will not** require a virtual key to keep
working at this time. Smartcar will poll these vehicles in the background every
5 minutes for data. These requests **will not** wake the vehicle.

#### What happens if a user does not add a virtual key for vehicles that support streaming?

If a vehicle is streaming capable and does not yet have a virtual key installed,
requests to the vehicle will be limited to 1 request every 8 hours for data. These requests **will
not** wake the vehicle.

#### What happens if I issue a command but the owner has revoked access through their Tesla portal?

We will throw a `CONNECTED_SERVICES_ACCOUNT:PERMISSION` error.

#### What happens if a user doesn’t select the correct permissions on Tesla’s side?

Connect maps Tesla’s permissions to Smartcar’s and only grants your application access to the ones requested. If we do not get the corresponding permission from Tesla, we will not grant your application access and throw the `PERMISSION:NULL` error as per usual when you make an API request.

Your users will need to [revoke access](\(/help/oem-integrations/tesla/faqs#how-can-my-users-fix-their-permissions-with-tesla\)) through the Tesla portal, then step through the flow again in order to fix this.

#### How can I tell which cars have gone through the new flow?

The [Migration Status](/api-reference/tesla/get-migration-status) make specific endpoint indicates if a vehicle still needs to be migrated to Tesla's new API.

#### Can owner and driver accounts authorize access with Smartcar through Connect?

Yes. Either account type can go through the Connect flow. As long as the Tesla account is attached to the vehicle, you can make requests to it.

#### Does the user need to be next to vehicle when adding a virtual key?

Owner accounts can add a virtual key remotely. Driver accounts need to be in
bluetooth range in order to add a virtual key.

#### Can driver accounts add a virtual key?

Yes. However, driver accounts can only pair virtual keys via bluetooth. They
cannot add a virtual key remotely.

#### Why are my users are seeing a location sharing notification on their navigation unit?

With the [recent changes to data
access](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/whats-new), vehicles will transmit their
live location if your application has requested access to location data. This
notification was put in place by Tesla to ensure transparency for owners about
what data is being shared and with whom.

The domain displayed will match the Virtual Key for your application.

#### How can my users update their permissions with Tesla?

Please [this guide](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#updating-access-with-tesla) for details on how to do facilitate this for your users.


# Important Updates
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/whats-new

Upcoming changes to data access and permissions in 2025

## January 10, 2025

Starting in March 2025, Tesla will require a new permission to access live
location data for its vehicles. Due to this change, you have two options:

**If your application needs live location data:**<br />
Users will need to reauthenticate and grant explicit access to the Vehicle
Location permission to continue receiving location data beyond March 2025, if
they haven’t already done so. This permission was previously included as part of
the Vehicle Information permission.

**If your application only needs to know whether the vehicle is at home:**<br />
A new boolean value will be available soon, and it will not require
reauthentication. Vehicle owners can set their home location in the Tesla
application.

### Why is this change occurring?

Tesla now provides users more granular data access control, and requires vehicle
owners to explicitly consent to sharing location data with 3rd parties like
Smartcar. This ultimately gives drivers more control and awareness of how and
what data they decide to share.

### Next steps if you need live location data

**1. Check existing permissions** <br />
Use the [User Access](/api-reference/tesla/get-user-access) endpoint to verify whether a vehicle has already
been granted the required permission on Tesla's side.

**2. Update Smartcar Connect scopes**<br />
To ensure vehicle owners grant the new permission, append `required:` to your
scopes in the Smartcar Connect URL (for example, `required:read_location`). For
detailed instructions, please refer to [this guide](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#requiring-tesla-permissions).

**3. Prompt users to reauthenticate**<br />
If needed, guide users to reauthenticate their Tesla vehicles using the methods outlined
[here](/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#updating-access-with-tesla).

<br />

<Warning>
  If the Vehicle Location permission isn’t granted by March 2025, you may
  encounter a `PERMISSION` error. As a result, your
  application will no longer receive live location data from affected Tesla
  vehicles until they reauthenticate.
</Warning>

## December 19, 2024

Starting **January 21, 2025**, a Virtual Key will be required to maintain access to
Tesla vehicle data. Failure to make the necessary changes could result in a
disruption to your service after this date. Below, we’ve outlined the steps you
need to take to prepare, depending on your situation.

### For new developers

If you're on an **Enterprise** or **Scale** plan, please reach out to your Account Manager or
Solutions Architect for information on setting up your own Virtual Key.

**Free** and **Build** customers can get started with the default Virtual Key and no
additional configuration.

    **What do you need to do?**

    To ensure continuous data access, please have your users add your Virtual Key to
    their vehicles if they haven’t already.  They can follow [this
    guide](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#adding-a-virtual-key)
    for more information. If you already prompt users to add a Virtual Key as your
    application issues commands - no additional work is needed, please continue to
    do so.

    **What is a Virtual Key?**

    A virtual key is a digital access method required by Tesla for third-party
    applications to receive vehicle data and issue commands to Tesla vehicles.
    Please see [this
    guide](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#adding-a-virtual-key)
    for more information.

    **Where can I find my Virtual Key?**

    The Virtual Key URL for your application will be sent back along with the
    authorization code after a user completes the Connect flow.
    Alternatively, you can reach out to Support or your Account Manager and they'll be able to provide
    it to you.

    **What happens if my users do not add my Virtual Key?**

    Starting January 21, 2025 you will not be able to get data from Tesla vehicles
    you are connected to and will receive a `virtual_key_required` error instead
    ([docs](https://smartcar.com/docs/errors/api-errors/connected-services-account-errors#virtual-key-required)).

    **What about vehicles that do not support Virtual Keys?**

    2020 and earlier Model S and X **will not** require a Virtual Key to keep
    working at this time. However, you may not always receive the latest data from
    the vehicle when you make an API request to Smartcar.

    **Will my users need to reauthenticate?**

    No. They simply need to add the Virtual Key to their vehicle.

    **What’s changing?**

    Tesla is changing the way data can be accessed by 3rd party applications.

    **What do you need to do?**

    To prepare for these changes and ensure uninterrupted data access, as well as the continued ability to issue commands, you will need to complete the following steps:

    **1. Communicate your desired custom subdomain to Smartcar**

    Smartcar will configure a custom subdomain under [**app.car**](http://app.car/) for you as part of this update.
    To complete this step, we need to know whether you are using a single Smartcar
    application or multiple applications (e.g., separate applications for your
    utility partners).

    Based on your setup, you may choose one of the following subdomain configurations:

    * **Single subdomain**: A unified subdomain for your entire organization (e.g., [acme.app.car](http://acme.app.car/)).

    * **Multiple subdomains**: Separate subdomains for individual Smartcar applications or use cases (e.g.,  [acme1.app.car](http://utility1.app.car/) and [acme2.app.car](http://acme2.app.car/)).

    This domain will be used instead of your currently configured domain.

    <Tip>
      This applies only to your **production** applications. Your staging and development applications can use one of the new subdomains we create without issue.
    </Tip>

    **2. Ask your users to add the new Virtual Key starting January 21, 2025**

    Starting January 21, 2025, Smartcar will transition to the newly configured subdomain from step 1. At this point, your users will be able to add the new Virtual Key, but **you will be unable to access new data or issue commands** until they have added it.

    **What is a Virtual Key?**

    A virtual key is a digital access method required by Tesla for third-party applications to receive vehicle data and issue commands to Tesla vehicles. Please see [this guide](https://smartcar.com/docs/help/oem-integrations/tesla/developers#adding-a-virtual-key) for more information.

    **Where can I find my new Virtual Key?**

    The Virtual Key for your application will be sent back along with the authorization code after a user completes the Connect flow. Additionally, we will provide it to you once step 1 is complete.

    **What happens if my users do not add my new Virtual Key?**

    Starting January 21, 2025 you will be unable to get data from vehicles without the new Virtual Key and will receive a `virtual_key_required` error instead ([docs](https://smartcar.com/docs/errors/api-errors/connected-services-account-errors#virtual-key-required)).

    **Can my users add the new Virtual Key before January 21, 2025?**

    No. Users will only be able to add the new Virtual Key starting January 21, 2025 once we perform the transition.

    **What about vehicles that do not support Virtual Keys?**

    2020 and earlier Model S and X **will not** require a Virtual Key to keep working at this time. However, you may not always receive the latest data from the vehicle when you make an API request to Smartcar.

    **Will my users need to reauthenticate?**

    No. They simply need to add the new Virtual Key to their vehicle.

# Reliability and Data Age
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/reliability-and-freshness

When making requests to vehicles, there is variation in how often data is updated and how many requests it can process in a given period. The tables below indicate the performance for each of Smartcar supported brands in each region.

**Reliability**<br />

Ranking indicates the reliability of data requests upstream i.e. the vehicle's or OEM's ability to process a request where 1 is the most reliable.

**Data Freshness**<br />
For a successful request, ranking indicates the average time since the data was last updated by the vehicle where 1 is the most fresh data for data or least average latency for actions.

# Vehicle Simulator
Source: https://smartcar.com/docs/help/vehicle-simulator

Learn about what to expect from Vehicle Simulator and how it compares to Live mode.

Vehicle Simulator allows you to test your application in realistic scenarios with a simulated Smartcar-compatible vehicle. Simulator responds to API requests just like a real vehicle. You can choose a simulated trip for your vehicle to take, and track it over time.

You can use the simulator for initial testing before you have a real vehicle to connect, or as part of an end-to-end testing suite.

## Creating a Simulated Vehicle

Simulated vehicles are managed in the Smartcar Dashboard.

Select "Add a vehicle" and select a vehicle by Make, Model, and Year, or provide a VIN for a US-based vehicle that you want to simulate. You'll be able to preview the API endpoints that are supported for the vehicle model you select.

Once you create your simulated vehicle, you'll select a simulated trip profile that the vehicle will follow. This profile can run automatically over time, or you can manually select a stage of the trip for the vehicle in the Dashboard.

## Connecting a Simulated Vehicle

Simulated vehicles generate a special set of credentials that mimic what a real-world vehicle owner would have. You'll use these credentials to establish a vehicle connection through the same Smartcar Connect flow that you will use for live vehicles.

In order for Connect to know you're using credentials generated from Vehicle Simulator, you'll need to pass `mode=simulated` in the [Connect URL](/connect/redirect-to-connect).

<Info>
  Please ensure you're passing or changing the country flag for Connect based on the region you've created your vehicle for.
  Failure to do so will result in an invalid credential error on login. You can read more about country selection for Connect [here](/connect/advanced-config/country-flag).

  <Accordion title="SDKs">
    You can set `mode` in the auth client builder to `simulated`.

Once your simulated vehicle is connected, you can make API requests to it just as you would a real vehicle.

Supported endpoints for the simulated vehicle will send responses with simulated data - unsupported endpoints will return errors just as they would with a real vehicle.

You can also send commands to simulated vehicles, like start/stop charge or lock/unlock doors. These requests will send responses that mimic that of a real vehicle, but the vehicle state will continue to reflect the simulated trip that was selected.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are tokens handled?">
    Access and refresh tokens behave as they do in `live` mode:

    * Access Tokens are valid for 2 hours
    * Refresh Tokens are valid for 60 days.
    * Using a refresh token to fetch an new access/refresh token pair will invalidate the refresh token that you used.

    **Reusing simulated vehicle credentials**<br />
    If you use the same simulated credentials for multiple Connect flow sessions, we'll issue a new set of tokens each time.
    This will not invalidate any existing tokens from previous logins so you'll be able to keep them refreshed in parallel without impacting the validity of the others.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any limits on how many vehicles I can create?">
    The number of simulated vehicles that can be created depends on your Smartcar plan tier. Please see [here](https://smartcar.com/pricing#plans) for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm getting an invalid credentials error when I try to sign in to a connected service account.">
    * Please check that you have launched Connect with the `mode=simulated` parameter
    * Please check that you are passing the country feature flag for the region you've set up your vehicle with.
      Please see [Country Selection](/connect/advanced-config/country-flag)for Connect for more information.

Learn about how to build applications that connect to millions of vehicles around the world.

Connected cars are vehicles that have in-built cellular modems. Most vehicles manufactured after 2015 have been shipping with this connectivity, or "embedded telematics." This essentially makes cars "smart" allowing them to communicate with the Internet. Take a look at this blog post for an in depth primer.

Learn about how to build applications that connect to millions of vehicles around the world.

The Smartcar platform allows mobility businesses to easily connect with their customers’ cars. Whether you need to track a vehicle’s location,
verify its mileage, share a virtual key, start charging an EV, monitor a car’s fuel tank level, inspect the tire pressure, or check the engine
oil life, Smartcar lets you do so with a single API request.

Take a look at the video below for a quick overview of how Smartcar works.
