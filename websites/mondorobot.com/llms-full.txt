## Coachella Festival Website

# Coachella

A website worthy of an iconic event


# Coachella

A website worthy of an iconic event


**What we did**

Web design

Motion design

Illustration

Coachella is the festival of our time. Each year, the event is a culture-defining snapshot of music, fashion and art attended by over 250,000 people.

This was our second year working with Coachella. Our challenge was to design a website that captures the feeling and grit of Coachella by incorporating nods to a simpler, analog approach to art.

[iframe](//player.vimeo.com/video/390515612?api=1&autoplay=1&background=1&loop=1&muted=1)

The concept


## Inspired by the desert, mountains and music

Watercolor brush strokes and hand-drawn illustrations, inspired by the desert, form the foundation of a design that portrays the environment and playfulness of Coachella.

Preserving our shared human history


**What we did** Web design

Web development

Dr. Sarah Parcak—the 2016 TED Prize winner—asked us to help realize her wish for humankind: locate and protect the millions of undiscovered archaeological sites buried all over the world.

We partnered with her company, GlobalXplorer°, to create an online science platform that enables anyone with an internet connection to contribute to her cause.

Digital expeditions


## Enlisting the power of a global community

GlobalXplorer° relies on volunteers to spot clues in satellite imagery that signal man-made objects hidden below the surface. We designed an ultra-focused experience that makes it easy for these budding "space archaeologists" to report their findings.

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/7562/1553898069-screen-shot-2019-03-29-at-4-20-58-pm.png)

Gamification


## Entice engagement and reward participation

To get eyes on as many satellite images as possible, we built a system of ranks and rewards tied to the performance of the individual and the community.

Educational content


## History is the best motivator

The GlobalXplorer° website is packed with articles on archaeology provided by National Geographic. They encourage an appreciation of the very history the platform was built to preserve.

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/7562/1553877369-global-explorer-text.jpg)

Mondo Robot was the perfect collaborator. They encouraged us to think big and then showed us how to achieve our desired outcome in a practical way on budget. They were fun, professional and super responsive. 15/10. Would recommend to everyone.

## Story first. Product second.

## Shopping for dogs made easy

The Ruffwear product catalog is vast. To help customers find their way, we designed a streamlined navigation system, smart product filters and a clever size selector for difficult-to-choose products like harnesses and collars.

The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research is the world's largest non-profit funder of Parkinson's research. It was founded in 2000 to accelerate the next generation of Parkinson's disease treatments and, ultimately, find a cure.

Mondo Robot has been helping the Foundation leverage the digital space since 2012. Our partnership is defined by two initiatives: Fox Insight (a groundbreaking online clinical study) and MichaelJFox.org (the Foundation's flagship website). Day in and day out, it's an honor to support the Foundation in their fight against Parkinson's.

## Serving anyone affected by Parkinson's disease

In designing MichaelJFox.org, we set out to create an action-oriented educational hub for the diverse audience impacted by Parkinson's. The site is built around the needs of patients, loved ones, researchers, clinicians and industry partners.

Fox Insight


## Over 30k participants helping to power Parkinson's research

We partnered with the Foundation to imagine and create Fox Insight, their first online clinical study. It's a web application where people with Parkinson's disease and their loved ones share information that could transform the search for better treatments.

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/7562/1579553824-mjff-large-media2.jpg)

## 1\. Participants complete online study visits

Every 90 days volunteers are invited to provide real-world information on symptoms, daily activities and other factors through online questionnaires.

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/7562/1579553838-mjff-text-block1.jpg)

## 2\. Contribute over time

Volunteers complete study visits for up to 5 years. This data provides researchers with long-term data to investigate health patterns and trends over time.

![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/7562/1579553932-mjff-text-block2.jpg)

## 3\. Data is shared with researchers worldwide

When combined with information from other volunteers, this large, diverse dataset can provide scientists with critical insights into the lived experience of those living with Parkinson's.

Development

The National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum (NLEMM) is a non-profit dedicated to remembering and honoring the American law enforcement officers who have given their lives in service. They also educate the public on the history of law enforcement and act as a platform for constructive dialog between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

NLEMM operates a memorial for fallen officers and a museum with immersive exhibitions in Washington D.C. They came to Mondo Robot for help in bringing their in-person experiences into the digital world. In collaboration with NLEMM and Verizon, Mondo Robot created "The Badge" — an app allowing users to learn, share stories and honor fallen officers, whether at the memorial or in their homes.

The creation of The Badge mobile app was led by the dynamic team at Mondo Robot. From the beginning, the process was thoughtful, innovative, and professional. The result was a platform that our institution will begin using to connect with our audience and achieve our mission in ways we never have before. We are looking forward to working with Mondo Robot as The Badge continues to grow.

**What we did**

Product vision, Experience design, Motion design.

Mondo Robot partnered with Specialized to help them foster meaningful relationships with cyclists beyond the point of sale. Through research, we identified three pain points that hinder the rider experience: community, equipment management, and safety.

Enter Specialized Ride, a digital platform built to help riders create, discover and join group rides, setup and manage their gear, and ride with peace of mind using connected safety technology.

Join the cycling community by downloading Ride for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/specialized-ride/id1374601630?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.specialized.ride&hl=en_US).

Ride Social Network


## A true connection between riders

Group rides are one of the great joys of cycling, but organizing them can be a pain. Ride streamlines the planning process without the headache. Browse and join rides created by cyclists in your community or plan your own ride anywhere in the world.

### Rider Safety

## Escape with peace of mind

Riding with others is the safest way to ride, but sometimes you just want to hit the road alone. The Ride app pairs with Specialized's helmet-mounted crash sensor, ANGi, to keep you safe before, during and after your ride.

Ruffwear, the Oregon-based performance dog-gear manufacturer, approached Mondo Robot to completely reimagine their online presence—a critical channel for selling their products around the world.

They wanted a new vision that would inspire dog owners (and their trail buddies) to be curious, take the first step, and start down their own road less traveled.

The concept


## Story first. Product second.

Ruffwear's mission says it all: "Inspire exploration for outdoor adventurers and their human companions." We brought this idea to life by featuring the stories of brand ambassadors throughout the site, including right on the homepage.

Shopping


## Shopping for dogs made easy

The Ruffwear product catalog is vast. To help customers find their way, we designed a streamlined navigation system, smart product filters and a clever size selector for difficult-to-choose products like harnesses and collars.
