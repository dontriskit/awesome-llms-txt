## Tally forms vs Youform

Tally is a nice tool to create forms in a Notion-like structure. The pricing also resonates with our philosophy, and it doesn't cost a bank to get submissions in Tally unlike other form builders like Typeform. That being said, there are few things where Youform stands apart from Tally:   

### Not a Notion like builder. 

Tally's Notion like builder flow is not for everyone. In Tally, you need to remember lots of keyboard shortcuts and the builder follows the keyboard-first approach. This philosophy resonates well with certain groups of people (like techies) but not with others. In Youform, the builder is pretty intuitive and follows point-and-click structure.

That's why people love to use Youform.

One-question-at-a-time form structure

Tally's builder is not made for "one question at a time" form structure. Sure, you can add pages, but the flow of the final form doesn't feel like as smooth  as other builders like Typeform or Youform. 

Especially, if you are coming from Typeform and looking for a true alternative, Youform is closer to Typeform than Tally.

Try out a sample form below:

This natural one-question-at-a-time flow of Youform helps in better conversion.

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/exportedimage-6-1739769654783-compressed.png)

  

What about features and pricing?

Tally and Youform are similar in terms of features and pricing. Whatever you use in Tally, you won't be missing in Youform. 

Moreover, the pricing is also the same. **Youform also offers a very generous free plan with unlimited submissions**. If you need some advanced features then [Youform Pro is just $29 per month](https://youform.com/pricing/).

Apart from this we have a comprehensive library of templates to get you started in no time. Check out Youform templates library [here](https://youform.com/templates/).​

## How we used Sean Ellis test to find out our product-market fit

Youform is a form builder which is an affordable Typeform alternative. 

We are building this since last two years and now successfully service 1000s of users.

Last week, we decided to conduct a **Sean Ellis Test** to understand our product market fit. 

**We already have a 20,000+ registered users**, but still we thought that finding the PMF with data backed by a proven test methodology won't harm. 

Sean Ellis, who coined the term "growth hacker" and was early growth in companies like Dropbox and Eventbrite devised this test. According to Sean Ellis test, you ask your users the following question: 

"_How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?_" and give them three options:   
\- very disappointed,  
\- somewhat disappointed  
\- not disappointed at all. 

The findings of the test says that if at least 40% of your users respond with "very disappointed", then it's a strong signal for product market fit. 

Hence we used this test and obviously used [Youform](https://youform.com/) to create the survey. 

We added it on our dashboard and only showed it to the repeated users. We kept it for a week and after a week, almost 105 users responded to the survey. 

Our finding was that 64% of the responders said that they will be very disappointed. So if we go by Sean Ellis test, Youform has passed the product market fit survey. 

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/exportedimage-3-1739513660569-compressed.png)

  

Do you want to conduct this survey for your product? You can use [this template](https://youform.com/templates/t/sean-ellis-test-product-market-fit-survey/) we have created so that you can set this up in 2 minutes.

Tags: stripe, integrations
URL: https://youform.com/blog/stripe-payments-in-youform-cm49spjxt0020dm7geg6ajzsb

With Youform you can collect payments using Stripe.

Just add a payment block to your form and connect with your Stripe account.  

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-12-04-at-4-1733311250960-compressed.png)

  

You need to have a Youform PRO account and an active Stripe account to start collecting payments. 

### What amount I can collect from forms?

You can either collect a fixed amount or collect the dynamically calculated value from the @price variable (using logic).

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-12-04-at-4-1733311635330-compressed.png)

  

### Which currencies are supported?  

Currently we support following currencies:

1.  US Dollars
2.  Euros
3.  Sterling
4.  Canadian Dollars
5.  Australian Dollars
6.  Swiss Francs
7.  Norwegian Krone
8.  Swedish Krona
9.  Danish Krone
10.  Mexican Peso
11.  Brazilian Real  
    

If your currency isn't listed let us know and we will add it.  

  

### How to send receipts to people when they pay via form?

For this you need to add at least one email field in your form. Then you can enable it from your payment block editor in the right.

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-12-04-at-4-1733311441945-compressed.png)

Here I added a contact block and used the email collected from there in the send receipt email option. When the user pays they will receive an email of payment receipt.

## Facebook Conversion tracking with Youform
Author: Davis Baer
Published: 2024-11-20
Category: Helpdesk
Tags: Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel, Form Conversion
URL: https://youform.com/blog/facebook-conversion-tracking-with-youform-cm3puklwi000kouxj62h0wdle

This tutorial provides a detailed step-by-step guide to setting up conversion tracking on your Youform using Google Tag Manager and Facebook Pixel.

Step 1: Connect Google Tag Manager in Youform
---------------------------------------------

The first step is to add Google Tag Manager to your Youform account.

Ensure you have a Google Tag Manager account set up. If you don’t have one, please [create it first](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en).

Once done please follow this guide to add [GTM to your Youform account](https://youform.com/blog/google-tag-manager-in-youform-cm1hzi7yf003sfw5sc3hhde1l).

Step 2: Create Triggers in Google Tag Manager
---------------------------------------------

If you have added your GTM ID as mentioned in the previous step Youform will send custom events to Google Tag Manager.

To use these events, we need to create Triggers within Google Tag Manager. 

For brevity, We will only cover 2 use cases: Form view and Form submission but as mentioned in the [Google Tag Manager in Youform](https://youform.com/blog/google-tag-manager-in-youform-cm1hzi7yf003sfw5sc3hhde1l) help article Youform triggers total 3 events.

### Creating Triggers for Form View:  

1.  Go to ********************Tag Manager******************** → Triggers → New.
2.  Search ************************Custom Event************************ as the Trigger Type.
3.  For **Event Name** fill in **formViewed**
4.  Name your trigger for example Youform View
5.  Save the trigger

### Creating Triggers for Form Submission:

This is the most common use case. You will need this if you want to mark your conversion when a form has been fully submitted. Here are the steps (same as above just with different trigger):

1.  Go to ********************Tag Manager******************** → Triggers → New.
2.  Search ************************Custom Event************************ as the Trigger Type.
3.  For **Event Name** fill in **formSubmitted**
4.  Name your trigger for example Youform Submission
5.  Save the trigger

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-11-20-at-6-1732106727130-compressed.png)

  

Step 3: Set up Conversion Tracking for Triggers
-----------------------------------------------

Now that we have created our triggers, we will now connect it with Facebook Conversion API. It's super easy just follow these steps:

1.  First we will get the Tag Template for Facebook Pixel. In your Google Tag Manager dashboard, go to Templates → Tag Templates → Search Gallery.  
    

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-11-20-at-6-1732107064420-compressed.png)

3.  Search for Facebook Pixel and add the template by _facebookarchive_ to your workspace.  
    

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-11-20-at-6-1732107123825-compressed.png)

5.  Now setup the tag:

*   Go to **Tags** \-> New.  
    
*   Select **Facebook Pixel** as the Tag Type.
*   Add your **Pixel ID** and select the Event Name you want to use. If you want to track the form view simply select the **PageView**  but you can select other events like **CompleteRegistration** or **SubmitApplication** etc. This depends on your use case.

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-11-20-at-6-1732107338462-compressed.png)

Now select your Trigger. Most commonly used trigger is **formSubmitted** (should appear with the name you selected. I added it as Youform Submission in above steps).  

Give this tag a name and save it.

Step 4: Test and Publish
------------------------

Now lets test your integration. 

Go to your [Facebook events manager](https://business.facebook.com/events_manager2) and make sure you have selected the correct business account.

Go to **Data Sources** \-> **Test events** and paste your Youform page URL inside the input to test it.

Submit your form to view the test event appear on this page.

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-11-20-at-6-1732108454452-compressed.png)

  

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-11-20-at-6-1732108472915-compressed.png)

Please note: This test data will appear immediately but live data takes upto 30 minutes to appear.  

All done. Your FB Pixel integration in Youform is now complete.

## Google forms searchable dropdown - 2 solutions
Author: Davis Baer
Published: 2024-09-06
Meta Title: Google forms searchable dropdown - 2 solutions
URL: https://youform.com/blog/google-forms-searchable-dropdown-cm0qnsmvn00j0syrxh9idh8f2

​​​​​​​​​​

Google Form's dropdown is already searchable. You can just open the dropdown and start typing. That being said, it's not quite intuitive for a user to know that they can type and search as there are no search input.

How to make dropdown in Google forms searchable? There are 2 solutions available:

1\. Use Pretty Forms Designer extension 
----------------------------------------

First you need to install the [pretty forms extension](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/pretty_forms_designer/1077249372154). 

After you have installed the extension, go to your Google form and make sure the extension is activated by clicking on the puzzle (extension icon) at the top.

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2025-03-06-at-9-1741234338413-compressed.png)

Then click on the Pretty Forms Designer from the puzzle dropdown and open the designer from the "Open Form Designer".  

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2025-03-06-at-9-1741234438768-compressed.png)

In the popup designer you can then select your dropdown question and click on the button "Options for item" as shown below:  

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2025-03-06-at-9-1741234526166-compressed.png)

Then select the "Make Dropdown Searchable" from the list. You can now preview and save this. Your form will start having the searchable dropdown. 

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2025-03-06-at-9-1741234610662-compressed.png)

Cons of using this approach:

Remember two things while you use this add-on: 

1.  This isn't entirely free. This is a paid add-on. You can use two forms and up to 10 responses in the free version. But if you need more, you need to go for one of their paid plans.
2.  The design limitations are there. The searchable dropdown when opened is not focused, so the user has to click on the input to start typing, which isn't great for user experience in my opinion.

2\. Use a better alternative: Youform
-------------------------------------

Using [Youform](https://write.superblog.ai/sites/supername/youform/posts/cm0qnsmvn00j0syrxh9idh8f2/youform.com) is no brainer as it not only provides the searchable dropdown (try it [here](https://app.youform.com/forms/hetvrn9j)) but also has much better user experience than Google Forms. Moreover, Youform is free for unlimited responses and provides much more features than Google Forms like 

*   Partial submissions (you can view submissions even if your users left the form without submitting)
*   Multi language support
*   Custom domains
*   Better designed forms
*   Lots of integrations
*   ... and much more which you can check [here](https://youform.com/pricing).

The shining star framework in the PHP world, Laravel, has just raised $57M in Series A funding in partnership with Accel.

Recently at Laracon US the [Laravel cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/) was announced. 

We believe these things will encourage more large-scale enterprises to trust and use Laravel.

We've been using Laravel since 2014, back when it was in version 4, and it’s been a key part of our development journey. Currently, at [Youform](https://write.superblog.ai/sites/supername/youform/posts/cm0pc9ahx00ffsyrxzz9064mr/youform.com), Laravel powers our platform, and we’re excited to see what new features and improvements this funding will bring to the table.

Cheers to the Laravel team!

## How to use webhooks in Youform?
Author: Davis Baer
Published: 2024-05-01
Category: Helpdesk
URL: https://youform.com/blog/how-to-use-webhooks-in-youform

Youform makes it easy to integrate the forms to any apps that you use, using webhooks.

Youform webhooks feature is available in free plan.

Please note: this blog is targeted towards users who knows a little about webhooks. If you don't know what it is, consider sending this to your developer.

The first step is to go into your form by choosing it from the dashboard.

Once you are inside the form just click on the **Integrate** tab. The following page will open:

![Integration page](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-05-01-at-4-1714560104554-compressed.png)

Now click on the **connect button** next to the Webhook item.

You will see a popup. Just enter your webhook URL. Please note that Youform will send a POST request to that URL with all the submitted data inside the body.

![Integration page](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-05-01-at-4-1714560242624-compressed.png)

Once you hit save, Youform will send webhook requests to that URL for completed responses. We don't send partial submissions to webhooks yet.

A sample webhook payload for a form that has 2 fields will look like following, basically key-value pair of question and submitted answers.

![Integration page](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screenshot-2024-05-01-at-4-1714560410807-compressed.png)

You can connect your form to Zapier webhooks as well to connect it to all the 6000+ apps Zapier supports.

Hope this guide will be helpful to you. Let us know if you need anything else in the webhooks feature. You can always add a feature request [here](https://youform.canny.io/feature-requests).​

## Auto-filling via URL parameters in Youform
Author: Davis Baer
Published: 2024-04-19
Category: Helpdesk
URL: https://youform.com/blog/auto-filling-via-url-parameters-in-youform

The "auto fill via URL parameter" feature allows you to have **Single Line** input blocks and **Rating** blocks automatically filled out.

**How it works:**

**​**Let's say you put "email" here:

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screen-shot-2024-04-19-at-2-1713549925870-compressed.png)

Now you can add ?email=name@email.com to the end of your form's URL, and the email address "name@email.com" would be automatically added in the form.

​  

Click this form link to see it in action 👇

[https://app.youform.io/forms/nlplkoxm?email=name@email.com](https://app.youform.io/forms/nlplkoxm?email=name@email.com)

  

_You can do the same for auto-filling name, address, or almost anything else. Moreover, do the same with the URL in your embed code, if you are embedding the Youform in your website._

  

\--------  

For Rating blocks, you can do the same thing:

![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/screen-shot-2024-04-19-at-2-1713550377032-compressed.png)

Then add ?rating=4 (or you could do 5) to the end of your form's URL:

[https://app.youform.io/forms/j1wxpbpy?rating=4](https://app.youform.io/forms/j1wxpbpy?rating=4)

However, you SHOULD still add labels here:

## How to add a file upload to a form in Squarespace

So you would like to add a file upload section to your form in Squarespace forms.

But unfortunately Squarespace does not support that.

Instead, you can use [Youform](http://www.youform.io), which is a form builder that supports file uploads (for free) and then [embed the form on your Squarespace site](https://youform.io/blog/how-to-embed-youform-in-squarespace).

## Youform fair usage policy
Author: Davis Baer
Published: 2024-04-04
Category: Helpdesk
URL: https://youform.com/blog/fair-usage-policy

We love offering a ton of value in Youform!

But sometimes people abuse Youform's generous limits.

If you are using Youform to spam or do anything nefarious, we reserve the right to shut off your Youform account.

If you are causing issues to our infrastructure due to extremely heavy use, we reserve the right to reach out to you about moving to a custom plan.

#### Examples of heavy usage

*   Receiving over 50,000 submissions per month consistently

*   File uploads of 100 GB/month or 500 GB of total storage​
*   Sending emails of over 10,000 per month

While occasional periods of heavy usage are okay, if you're consistently exceeding these limits, we'll reach out to discuss a custom plan to ensure everything runs smoothly.

**Please note**: If you are a not a PRO user and try to hide the Youform branding from your forms we have every right to take down your account. This goes against our policy. If you want to remove Youform branding from your forms please consider purchasing Youform PRO.

Google Forms is great, but it does not allow you to capture the responses of people who did not fully fill out your form.

[Youform](https://youform.io) is a Google Forms alternative that allows you to view partial form submissions (in addition to complete form submissions).

[![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/pastedimage312241108am-1710256248314-compressed.jpg)](https://youform.io/)

With [Youform](https://youform.io/), when someone fills out a form, you can view the responses even if they are only partial responses, and they didn't fully complete the form.
