## Docs

- [Advanced Profile API](https://docs.dns0.eu/apple-configuration-profile/advanced-profile-api.md): Programmatically generate Apple configuration profiles with custom network and domain exceptions, or prohibit users from disabling the profile
- [Introduction](https://docs.dns0.eu/data-feeds/introduction.md): We operate a sophisticated domain intelligence infrastructure to **collect**, **process** and **analyze** (very) large amounts of data. We make this data available to our customers and threat intelligence partners in real-time and as daily downloadable feeds.
- [Newly Active Domains (NAD)](https://docs.dns0.eu/data-feeds/newly-active-domains-nad.md): Domains are sometimes warmed up — often showing the appearance of legit activity — to avoid detection before suddenly turning malicious, making this data a very valuable subset of domains to analyze when looking for malicious activity.
- [Newly Active Hostnames (NAH)](https://docs.dns0.eu/data-feeds/newly-active-hostnames-nah.md): Domains are sometimes warmed up — often showing the appearance of legit activity — to avoid detection before suddenly turning malicious, making this data a very valuable subset of domains to analyze when looking for malicious activity.
- [Newly Issued Certificates (NIC)](https://docs.dns0.eu/data-feeds/newly-issued-certificates-nic.md): Nearly all malicious domains get issued a certificate — either manually or automatically — very early in their lifecycle and before becoming active. Certificates also contain valuable pieces of information and patterns when investigating malicious activity.
- [Newly Observed Domains (NOD)](https://docs.dns0.eu/data-feeds/newly-observed-domains-nod.md): While NRD focuses on the first appearance of a domain name in a registry (i.e. the domain registration), NOD focuses on the first time a domain name is observed in the DNS. Newly registered domains are sometimes purposely kept unconfigured for a period of time to avoid detection, making this data another valuable subset of domains to analyze when looking for malicious activity.
- [Newly Observed Hostnames (NOH)](https://docs.dns0.eu/data-feeds/newly-observed-hostnames-noh.md): NOH focuses on the first time a hostname is observed in the DNS and can help uncover malicious activity at the subdomain level.
- [Newly Registered Domains (NRD)](https://docs.dns0.eu/data-feeds/newly-registered-domains-nrd.md): Most malicious domains are registered from a few days to only a few seconds before becoming active, making those domains a very valuable subset of domains to analyze when looking for future malicious activity.
- [Passive DNS (RRsets)](https://docs.dns0.eu/data-feeds/passive-dns-rrsets.md): The real-time firehose of passive DNS data from [dns0.eu](https://dns0.eu).
- [Become a Partner](https://docs.dns0.eu/infrastructure-partners/become-a-partner.md): We partner with hosting providers and ISPs across the European Union to host DNS nodes for [dns0.eu](https://dns0.eu)
- [Introduction](https://docs.dns0.eu/introduction.md): Welcome to [dns0.eu](https://dns0.eu) official documentation.
