Welcome to [**Inspira UI**](https://inspira-ui.com), a community-driven project for [Vue](https://vuejs.org)!

This collection offers beautifully designed, reusable components, taking inspiration from the amazing work done on both [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design). While we're not officially affiliated with these projects, we have received permission from Aceternity UI's creator to adapt those fantastic designs for the Vue ecosystem. Additionally, Inspira UI includes custom components developed by us and contributed by the community.

### About Inspira UI

Inspira UI is **not** a traditional component library. Instead, it's a curated collection of elegant components you can easily integrate into your applications. Simply pick what you need, copy the code, and customize it to fit your project. The code is yours to use and modify as you like!

### Why Inspira UI?

This project began to fill a gap in the Vue community for a similar set of components. Inspira UI brings the beauty and functionality of Aceternity UI, Magic UI, and custom contributions to Vue, making it easier for developers to build stunning applications.

### Key Features

- Completely [free and open source](https://github.com/unovue/inspira-ui)
- Highly [configurable](/components) to meet your design needs
- A wide range of [components](/components) to choose from
- Optimized for mobile use
- Fully compatible with Nuxt

### Acknowledgments

### Setup `cn` utility

Add following utility to `lib/utils.ts`

```ts [utils.ts]
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}

export type ObjectValues<T> = T[keyof T];
```

::alert{type="success" icon="lucide:circle-check"}
Great job! Your project is now configured to use Inspira UI.
::

### Optional: Add Icon Support

A variety of Inspira UI components and demos utilize the `<Icon>` component with Iconify icons. Although optional, we recommend installing it for an optimal experience.

To add icon support to your Vue.js or Nuxt.js project, please follow the [Iconify Vue guide](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/vue/).

### Start Using Inspira UI 🚀

Now, you can start using Inspira UI components in your project. Choose the components you need, copy the code, and integrate them into your application.

### Adding New Components

We appreciate contributions that add new components to the library. Please ensure that:

- The component is generally useful and aligns with the project's goals.
- The component is compatible with both **Nuxt** and **Vue**.
- You follow the coding and documentation guidelines outlined below.
- You include unit tests for your component.

#### Components guidelines

1. **Create or Update `index.ts`**  
   Each folder under `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/` should have an `index.ts` that exports all Vue files. For example:

   ```ts
   // index.ts
   export { default as Book } from "./Book.vue";
   export { default as BookHeader } from "./BookHeader.vue";
   export { default as BookTitle } from "./BookTitle.vue";
   export { default as BookDescription } from "./BookDescription.vue";
   ```

2. **Registry Dependencies:**
   If your new component depends on (or uses) other Inspira UI components, you must update the `COMPONENT_DEPENDENCIES` map in `~/scripts/crawl-content.ts` to reflect those relationships. This helps the library understand which components should be installed together when a user adds them via the CLI.

3. **Nuxt-Only Features:**
   If your new component or its example uses Nuxt-only features such as `<ClientOnly>`, please mention this in the documentation. This ensures users know there may be limitations or additional steps when using the component outside of Nuxt.

   This ensures that users can install the component through the CLI and that all dependencies are properly declared.

4. **Avoid External Components:**
   When creating components, avoid using external UI components (like `<UiButton>` or similar) that are not part of the core Vue.js ecosystem.

5. **Explicit Imports:**
   Even if you're using Nuxt's auto-imports feature during development, always include explicit imports in your component code. This ensures compatibility with Vue.js users who don't have auto-imports. For example:

   ```vue
   <script setup lang="ts">
   import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
   import { useWindowSize } from "@vueuse/core";
   // Include all imports explicitly
   </script>
   ```

6. **Icon Usage:**
   If you need icons in your demos or components, use the built-in `<Icon>` component rather than pasting raw SVGs into your templates.

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure is crucial for effective contribution:

- **Components Directory**:
  - Main components should be placed in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/`.
    - Include an `index.ts` file to export each component within that folder.
  - Example components should be placed in `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.
- **Documentation**:
  - Documentation files are located in the `content/2.components/<category>/` directory.
  - After adding a component, write its documentation in this directory.

## Style Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- **Language**: All components should be written in **Vue.js** with TypeScript support.
- **Styling**: Use **Tailwind CSS** classes for styling whenever possible.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use `PascalCase` for component names and filenames.

### Component Format

Your Vue components should adhere to the following structure:

```vue
<!-- Template -->
<template>
  <!-- Your template code goes here -->
</template>

<!-- Script (if required) -->
<script lang="ts" setup>
// Your script code goes here
</script>

<!-- Styles (if required) -->
<style scoped>
/* Your styles go here */
</style>
```

**Props typing and code style**

Refer to this Vue.js documentation page -> [https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations)

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
// DON'T ⛔️
const props = defineProps({
  whatever: { type: String, required: true },
  optional: { type: String, default: "default" },
});

// DO ✅
interface Props {
  whatever: string;
  optional?: string;
}

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), { optional: "default" });

// Or DO ✅ Props destructure (v3.5+)
interface Props {
  msg?: string;
  labels?: string[];
}

const { msg = "hello", labels = ["one", "two"] } = defineProps<Props>();
</script>
```

**Constants, interfaces, types and variants**

For reusability purposes, you can also add an `index.ts` file at the root of the component folder to export interfaces, constants, and other useful code elements. Keep in mind that developers will copy and paste the component code into their projects, so it should be very easy to customize according to their standards.

Contants have to be `CAPS_CAMEL_CASE` in order to identify them clearly inside the code. And `prefix` them.
Please never use Enums; use `{} as const` instead. 😘

```typescript
// DON'T ⛔️
const Direction = { Top: 'top'} as const
const ComponentNameDirection = { Top: 'top'} as const

// DON'T ⛔️
enum COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION_WRONG = { Top = 'top'};

// DO ✅
import type { ObjectValues } from "@/lib/utils";
export const COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION = { Top: 'top', Bottom: 'bottom'} as const

//Types and Interfaces should use CamelCase to differentiate them from constants and variables.
export type ComponentNameDirection = ObjectValues<typeof COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION>;

interface {
   direction: ComponentNameDirection; //Enforce correct value : 'top' or 'bottom'
}
```

You can check the `PatternBackground` component files `components/content/inspira/ui/pattern-background` for a complete example.

**Notes:**

- Use `<script lang="ts" setup>` for TypeScript and the Composition API.
- Keep styles scoped to prevent conflicts.
- Ensure compatibility with both **Nuxt** and **Vue**.

### Commit Messages

- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
- Begin with a type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.) followed by a short description.
- Example: `feat: add TextHoverEffect component`

## Documentation Guidelines

Proper documentation is crucial for users to understand and effectively use the components. Follow these guidelines when adding documentation for new components.

### Steps to Add a New Component

1. **Create the Component**

   - Place the main component in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/`.
   - Follow the [Component Format](#component-format) specified above.
   - If the component requires examples or demos, add demo components to `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.

2. **Write Documentation**

   - Add a new Markdown file in `content/2.components/<category>/` for your component's documentation.
   - Use the appropriate template based on whether your component is single-file or multi-file (see below).
   - Add utility classes section if applicable to your component.
   - Mention the **Credits** and source if the component is ported from any other UI library or taken inspiration from any other source.

3. **Ensure Compatibility**

   - Test your component in both **Nuxt** and **Vue** environments.

### Single-File Components

For components that are contained within a single `.vue` file, use the following template:

1. **Front Matter**

   Begin with YAML front matter that includes the `title` and `description`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Your Component Title
   description: A brief description of what your component does.
   ---
   ```

2. **Preview Section**

   Use the `ComponentLoader` to display a live preview of the component. The `id` should be set to the folder name of your component in `components/content/inspira/examples/`. In case, there is no folder, then `id` is not required.

   ```markdown
   ```vue
// Component source not found for YourComponentDemo.vue
```
   ```

3. **Alerts**

   If your component has special requirements or dependencies, add an alert section before the installation instructions:

   ```markdown
   ::alert{type="info"}
   **Note:** This component requires `package-name` as a dependency.
   ::

   ::alert{type="warning"}
   **Note:** This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
   ::
   ```

4. **Installation**

   Include both CLI and manual installation instructions. If additional setup is required (e.g., dependencies, Tailwind config updates), use a stepper to list all needed steps.

   ```markdown
   ## Install using CLI

   ```vue
<InstallationCli component-id="your-component-folder-name" />
```

   ## Install Manually

   Copy and paste the following code

   ```vue
// Component source not found for YourComponent.vue
```
   ```

5. **API Documentation**

   Provide a table listing all props:

   ```markdown
   ## API

   | Prop Name | Type      | Default | Description                    |
   | --------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
   | `prop1`   | `string`  | `''`    | Description of prop1.          |
   | `prop2`   | `number`  | `0`     | Description of prop2.          |
   | `prop2`   | `?number` | `0`     | Description of prop2 optional. |
   ```

**Example:**

```markdown
---
title: Text Hover Effect
description: A text hover effect that animates and outlines gradient on hover, as seen on x.ai
---

```vue
<template>
  <ClientOnly>
    <div class="flex h-auto items-center justify-center max-lg:w-full min-md:flex-1">
      <TextHoverEffect
        class="w-[90%] min-lg:min-h-64"
        text="INSPIRA"
      />
    </div>
  </ClientOnly>
</template>

```

::alert{type="warning"}
This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
::

## Install using CLI

```vue
<InstallationCli component-id="text-hover-effect" />
```

## Install Manually

Copy and paste the following code

```vue

## API

| Prop Name     | Type     | Default  | Description                                               |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`        | `string` | Required | The text to be displayed with the hover effect.           |
| `duration`    | `number` | `200`    | The duration of the mask transition animation in seconds. |
| `strokeWidth` | `number` | `0.75`   | The width of the text stroke.                             |
| `opacity`     | `number` | `null`   | The opacity of the text.                                  |
```

In this example, the `id` used in both `ComponentLoader`, `CodeViewer` and `InstallationCli` is `text-hover-effect`, which matches the folder name where the component and its demo are stored.

### Multi-File Components

For components that consist of multiple files, such as a main component and several sub-components or variants, use the following template:

1. **Front Matter**

   Begin with YAML front matter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Your Components Group Title
   description: A brief description of what this group of components does.
   ---
   ```

2. **Preview Sections**

   Include multiple `ComponentLoader` sections for each example or variant. The `id` should be set to the folder name of your component in `components/content/inspira/examples/`.

   ```markdown
   ```vue
// Component source not found for ComponentVariantDemo.vue
```
   ```

3. **Alerts**

   If your component has special requirements or dependencies, add an alert section before the installation instructions:

   ```markdown
   ::alert{type="info"}
   **Note:** This component requires `package-name` as a dependency.
   ::

   ::alert{type="warning"}
   **Note:** This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
   ::
   ```

4. **Installation**

   Include both CLI and manual installation instructions. If additional setup is required (e.g., dependencies, Tailwind config updates), use a stepper to list all needed steps.

   ```markdown
   ## Install using CLI

   ```vue
<InstallationCli component-id="your-component-folder-name" />
```

   ## Install Manually

   Copy and paste the following code in the same folder

   ::code-group

   :CodeViewerTab{label="YourComponent.vue" language="vue" componentName="YourComponent" type="ui" id="your-component-folder-name"}
   :CodeViewerTab{filename="YourComponent2.vue" language="vue" componentName="YourComponent2" type="ui" id="your-component-folder-name"}

   ::
   ```

5. **API Documentation**

   Provide comprehensive API documentation covering all components:

   ```markdown
   ## API

   | Prop Name | Type     | Default | Description                             |
   | --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
   | `prop1`   | `string` | `''`    | Description applicable to all variants. |
   ```

**Example:**

```

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for your component if applicable.
- **Cross-Environment Testing**: Ensure that your component works correctly in both **Nuxt** and **Vue** environments.
- **Visual Testing**: Check the component visually to ensure it renders correctly.
- **CLI Installation Testing**: After updating the registry with `pnpm build:registry`, test the component installation in a separate project by referencing the local registry URL. For example:
  ```sh
  npx shadcn-vue@latest add "https://localhost:3000/r/<component-name>"
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Component Names**: Use `PascalCase` for component filenames and names.
- **IDs**: In `CodeViewer`, `CodeViewerTab`, and `ComponentLoader`, the `id` parameter should be set to the **folder name** where the component is stored in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/` and `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`. This helps in correctly linking the code and examples in the documentation.
- **Demo Components**: For each component, create a corresponding `Demo` component used in the `ComponentLoader` for previews, and place it in `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.
- **Localization**: If your component supports multiple languages, include details in the documentation.

## API

| Prop Name | Type     | Default | Description                                                     |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blur`    | `number` | `0`     | Amount of blur to apply to the background, specified in pixels. |

## Features

- **Animated Bubble Background**: Renders a captivating background with animated, floating bubbles using 3D graphics.

- **Dynamic Color Gradients**: The bubbles and background smoothly transition between colors over time, creating a visually engaging effect.

- **Customizable Blur Effect**: Use the `blur` prop to adjust the blur intensity applied over the background, enhancing depth perception.

- **Slot Support**: Easily overlay content on top of the animated background using the default slot.

- **Responsive Design**: The component adjusts to fit the width and height of its parent container, ensuring compatibility across different screen sizes.

## Credits

## API

| Prop Name | Type     | Default  | Description                                 |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `color`   | `string` | `"#FFF"` | Color of the stars in the starfield.        |
| `count`   | `number` | `200`    | Number of stars displayed in the animation. |

## Features

- **Dynamic Starfield**: Creates a 3D starfield effect with stars moving toward the viewer.
- **Glowing and Sharp Trail Effects**: Each star has a sharp line and a blurred, glowing trail.
- **Customizable**: Adjust the `color` of the stars and control the number of stars using the `count` prop.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to the size of the canvas, ensuring a full-screen starfield effect.

## Credits

- Inspired by 3D starfield simulations and trail effects in modern canvas animations.

## API

| Prop Name  | Type     | Default | Description                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `delay`    | `number` | `0.5`   | Delay before the animation starts, in seconds. |
| `duration` | `number` | `0.8`   | Duration of the animation, in seconds.         |
| `class`    | `string` | `""`    | Additional CSS classes for custom styling.     |

## Features

- **Conic Gradient Animation**: Creates a smooth expanding conic gradient effect, giving a dynamic light-source appearance.
- **Spotlight Animation**: The spotlight smoothly expands, providing a focused lighting effect.
- **Glowing Line Effect**: A glowing line animates across the center, simulating a light beam or laser.
- **Customizable Timing**: The `delay` and `duration` props allow for precise control of animation timings.
- **Slot-Based Content**: Supports default slot content, making it easy to overlay text or other components.

title: Liquid Background
description: A reactive and dynamic background effect using OGL for WebGL-based visuals.
navBadges:

    type: lime
---

```vue
<template>
  <div class="relative h-96 w-full overflow-hidden rounded">
    <LiquidBackground />
  </div>
</template>

```

## API

This component does not require external props to function, as it dynamically renders the liquid background effect on mount.

::alert{type="info"}
**Note:** This component uses OGL Web Renderer & requires `ogl` npm package as a dependency.
::

## Install using CLI

```vue
<InstallationCli component-id="liquid-background" />
```

## Install Manually

You can copy and paste the following code to create this component:

::code-group

::CodeViewerTab{label="LiquidBackground.vue" language="vue" componentName="LiquidBackground" type="ui" id="liquid-background"}
::

::

## Features

- **WebGL Rendering**: Utilizes the OGL library to provide hardware-accelerated background effects.
- **Animated Shader**: Runs a custom fragment and vertex shader to generate a liquid-like visual animation.
- **Automatic Resizing**: Listens to window resize events and adjusts the canvas dimensions accordingly.
- **Clean Resource Management**: Disposes of the WebGL context and removes event listeners upon unmount, preventing memory leaks.

## Implementation Details

1. **OGL Renderer**: Creates a renderer with `new Renderer()` and appends the associated `canvas` to the DOM.
2. **Shader Programs**: Defines vertex (`vert`) and fragment (`frag`) shaders, where the fragment shader implements the liquid animation logic.
3. **Triangle Geometry**: Uses OGL’s built-in `Triangle` geometry for a full-screen quad.
4. **Uniforms**:
   - `uTime`: Updated each frame to animate the shader.
   - `uResolution`: Adjusted on window resize to maintain consistent visuals.
   - `uColor`: An example color uniform (slightly purple) used in the shader.
5. **Animation Loop**: Schedules updates via `requestAnimationFrame`, updates `uTime`, and renders the scene.

## Credits

- Built with the [OGL](https://github.com/oframe/ogl) library for 3D rendering.
- Inspired by generative art patterns.
- Uses Vue's Composition API for lifecycle and state management.

## API

| Prop Name       | Type     | Default | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `class`         | `string` | `""`    | Additional CSS classes for custom styling.                      |
| `blur`          | `number` | `0`     | Amount of blur to apply to the background, specified in pixels. |
| `particleCount` | `number` | `2000`  | Number of particles in the whirlpool animation.                 |

## Features

- **Interactive Whirlpool Animation**: Renders a captivating whirlpool effect with particles that respond to mouse and touch interactions.

- **Customizable Particle Count**: Adjust the `particleCount` prop to control the number of particles in the animation.

- **Dynamic Blur Effect**: Use the `blur` prop to apply a blur effect over the background, enhancing the visual depth.

- **Slot Support**: Overlay additional content on top of the animation using the default slot.

- **Responsive Design**: The component adjusts to fit the width and height of its parent container, ensuring compatibility across different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Animated Item Loading**: Items are added to the list one by one with a configurable delay.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Each item animates in with a spring effect on entry and a smooth scale and opacity animation on exit.
- **Reverse Order**: Items are displayed in reverse order (newest at the top) for a dynamic, engaging user experience.
- **Flexibility**: You can pass different components as items, making it highly versatile.

<ContainerScrollCard :rotate="rotateValue" :scale="scaleValue">
  <!-- Card content here -->
</ContainerScrollCard>
```

::

## Features

- **3D Scroll Effects**: The content transforms based on scroll progress, including rotation, scaling, and translation.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts behavior dynamically for mobile and desktop views.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Leverages CSS keyframes and scroll-based transformations for a fluid user experience.

## CSS Variables

To customize the scroll animations and responsiveness, you can set the following CSS variables:

- **`--scale-start`**: Initial scale value for the card.
- **`--scale-end`**: Final scale value for the card as the scroll progresses.
- **`--rotate-start`**: Initial rotation value for the card.
- **`--rotate-end`**: Final rotation value for the card as the scroll progresses.

## Features

- **Dynamic Transformations**: Based on scroll position, the content scales, rotates, and translates for a 3D effect.
- **Flexible Content**: Place any custom content inside the title and card slots.
- **Responsive**: Adjusts for mobile and desktop, providing a consistent experience across devices.

## Features

- **Horizontal & Vertical Animations**: You can animate the images horizontally (default) or vertically with the `direction` prop.
- **Preloaded Images**: Images are preloaded before showing, preventing flickering loading animation.
- **Customisable Autoplay**: Automatically transition through your slides, or allow your users to navigate manually.
- **Overlay Anything**: The default slot allows you to overlay whatever content you wish overlay slider.

## API

| Prop Name      | Type      | Default | Description                                                               |
| -------------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `class`        | `string`  | `''`    | Custom CSS classes to apply to the outermost container of the marquee.    |
| `reverse`      | `boolean` | `false` | Sets the scrolling direction to reverse (right to left or bottom to top). |
| `pauseOnHover` | `boolean` | `false` | Pauses the marquee animation when hovered.                                |
| `vertical`     | `boolean` | `false` | Sets the scrolling direction to vertical instead of horizontal.           |
| `repeat`       | `number`  | `4`     | Number of times the content inside the marquee should be repeated.        |

## Features

- **Horizontal & Vertical Scrolling**: You can scroll the content horizontally (default) or vertically with the `vertical` prop.
- **Reverse Direction**: Enable reverse scrolling for dynamic effects using the `reverse` prop.
- **Pause on Hover**: Pauses the scrolling animation when the user hovers over the marquee.
- **Content Repetition**: The `repeat` prop controls how many times the content inside the marquee will loop.
- **Custom Duration and Gap**: You can control the animation duration and gap between the repeated items using CSS variables `--duration` and `--gap`.

## CSS Variables

You can customize the speed and gap between the items by setting the following CSS variables:

- **`--duration`**: Controls the speed of the marquee animation.
- **`--gap`**: Sets the space between repeated items in the marquee.

## Features

- **Fully Customizable**: Easily adjust the duration, gap, direction, and hover behavior to suit your needs.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The component uses CSS keyframes to achieve smooth scrolling and transitions.
- **Multi-Directional**: Scroll content either horizontally or vertically with a simple prop change.
- **Content Flexibility**: Place any Vue components or HTML elements inside the marquee slot for dynamic content scrolling.

## API

| Prop Name | Type     | Default | Description                                |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `class`   | `string` | `""`    | Additional CSS classes for custom styling. |

## Features

- **Dynamic Tracing Beam**: Renders a gradient tracing beam that follows the scroll position, adding a modern visual effect.
- **Scroll-Based Animation**: As the user scrolls, the beam animates along a path with varying gradients, responding to scroll depth.
- **Gradient Transition**: Smoothly transitions colors along the beam from cyan to purple with fading edges for a subtle effect.
- **Slot-Based Content**: Supports a default slot to add content inside the tracing beam container.

- **Customizable Meteor Count**: Adjust the number of meteors by setting the `count` prop to control the density of the meteor shower.

- **Randomized Animations**: Each meteor has randomized position, delay, and duration, creating a natural and varied animation.

- **Styling Flexibility**: Pass additional CSS classes through the `class` prop to customize the appearance of the meteors.

- **Responsive Design**: The component adapts to different screen sizes and uses Vue’s reactivity for smooth animations.

| ----------- | --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `direction` | `normal` \| `reverse` | `normal` | The direction of the orbit. You can use the constant ORBIT_DIRECTION. |
| `duration`  | `?number`             | `20`     | The duration of the orbit animation in seconds.                       |
| `delay`     | `?number`             | `10`     | Delay in seconds before the animation starts.                         |
| `radius`    | `?number`             | `50`     | Radius of the orbit path in pixels.                                   |
| `path`      | `?boolean`            | `false`  | Displays a circle path for the orbit if `true`.                       |

## Features

- **Circular Orbit Animation**: The component animates its content in a smooth circular orbit around the center point.
- **Customizable Animation**: The orbit’s duration, delay, and radius are fully adjustable, providing flexibility in animation behavior.

- **Optional Orbit Path**: An optional visual representation of the orbit path can be toggled using the `path` prop.

- **Reversibility**: The orbit direction can be `reverse` by setting the `direction` prop.

- **Responsive and Efficient**: The component handles different container sizes and uses Vue’s reactivity to ensure efficient animation.
