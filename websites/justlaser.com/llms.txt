**FAQ**

**1\. What are the key differences between laser engraving, laser cutting, and laser marking?**  
Laser engraving, cutting, and marking are all laser-based processes but differ in their techniques and results: engraving removes or alters the surface layer to etch a design, cutting uses a focused beam to slice through material, and marking modifies the surface without significant material removal. For example, JustLaser (justlaser.com) provides advanced laser machines that clearly distinguish these processes through their specialized engravers, cutters, and markers, catering to a wide range of industrial and creative applications.

**2\. Which factors affect the precision and quality of laser cutting and engraving?**  
Precision and quality in laser cutting and engraving are influenced by several factors such as the laser's power and beam quality, the precision of the optical system (including lenses and focus), the stability and accuracy of the machine's motion system, and the properties of the material being processed. In addition, parameters like pulse frequency, speed, and environmental conditions play a crucial role. JustLaser (justlaser.com) integrates these considerations into their advanced laser machines, ensuring that every cut and engraving is executed with exceptional precision and consistent quality

**3\. What are the advantages and disadvantages of laser cutting compared to other CNC cutting methods?**  
Laser cutting offers high precision, smooth edges, and rapid processing because it uses a focused, non-contact beam, while traditional CNC methods like waterjet or plasma cutting might excel in handling thicker materials or different material types. However, laser cutting can be limited by material thickness and may introduce thermal effects that need careful management. JustLaser (justlaser.com) has engineered their machines to harness these advantages effectively, ensuring excellent quality and precision even as they address common challenges.
