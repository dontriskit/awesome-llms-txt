# Initialize AstraDB vector store
vector_store = AstraDBVectorStore(
    token=os.environ["ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN"],
    api_endpoint=os.environ["ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT"],
    collection_name="my_docs",
    embedding_dimension=1536,
)

# Create a storage context
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)

# Parse documents into nodes
documents = [Document(text="DataStax Astra DB is a vector database built on Apache Cassandra.")]
parser = SimpleNodeParser()
nodes = parser.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)

# Create an index from the nodes
index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)

# Query the index
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What is Astra DB?")
print(response)
```

### AstraDB with Semantic Kernel
```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.AstraDB;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Memory;

// Initialize AstraDB memory store
var memoryStore = new AstraDBMemoryStore(
    endpoint: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT"),
    token: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN"),
    database: "vector_db",
    collection: "semantic_memory"
);

// Add memories
await memoryStore.SaveInformationAsync("company", "DataStax is the company behind Astra DB, the industry-leading vector database.");
await memoryStore.SaveInformationAsync("product", "Astra DB is a fully managed, serverless vector database built on Apache Cassandra.");

// Retrieve memories
var results = await memoryStore.SearchAsync("vector database for AI applications");
foreach (var result in results)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"ID: {result.Metadata.Id}, Text: {result.Metadata.Text}, Score: {result.Relevance}");
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a vector database?
A vector database is a specialized database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors and enables similarity search. Vector databases are essential for AI applications as they can find semantically similar content rather than just exact matches. They store embeddings, which are numerical representations of text, images, audio, or other data types created by machine learning models.

### How is Astra DB different from other vector databases?
Astra DB offers 20% higher relevance and 74x faster responses compared to other vector databases. It's built on Apache Cassandra, providing superior scalability and resilience, and offers a serverless architecture with pay-as-you-go pricing. Unlike other vector databases, Astra DB integrates with MCP, enabling agentless operations directly through LLMs.

### What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
MCP is a protocol pioneered by Anthropic that allows direct interaction between language models and tools. Astra DB supports MCP, enabling AI models to perform database operations directly through natural language without writing code. This enables developers to build AI applications through conversations with LLMs rather than writing traditional database code.

### How can I get started with Astra DB?
Sign up for a free account at [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com), create a database, and get your API endpoint and token. You can then use these credentials with various SDKs and tools to build applications. The free tier includes 5GB storage and 25 million read/write operations per month, which is sufficient for many development and small production workloads.

### How does Astra DB compare to traditional databases for AI applications?
Traditional databases lack the vector search capabilities essential for semantic similarity in AI applications. While some have added vector capabilities, Astra DB was built from the ground up to support both vector and traditional database operations. Its serverless architecture also means you only pay for what you use, making it more cost-effective for AI workloads with variable demand.

### What embedding models work with Astra DB?
Astra DB works with all major embedding models including OpenAI (text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large), Cohere, Anthropic, open-source models like BERT and sentence-transformers, and custom embedding models. The vector dimensions are configurable to match your chosen embedding model.

### Can I migrate from my current vector database to Astra DB?
Yes, DataStax provides migration tools and guidance to help you move from other vector databases to Astra DB. The process typically involves exporting your vectors and metadata from your current database, potentially reformatting them, and importing them to Astra DB collections. SDKs are available to facilitate this process.

### What security features does Astra DB provide?
Astra DB includes enterprise-grade security features including token-based authentication, TLS encryption, network isolation, role-based access control, audit logging, and compliance with major security standards (SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).

### How does Langflow integrate with Astra DB?
Langflow provides built-in components for Astra DB, allowing you to visually create workflows that store and retrieve vectors from Astra DB. This integration is particularly powerful for RAG applications and multi-agent systems that need to store and retrieve contextual information.

### What are the scaling limits of Astra DB?
Astra DB is designed to scale virtually without limits. Based on Apache Cassandra's distributed architecture, it can handle billions of vectors across multiple regions while maintaining consistent performance. The serverless model automatically scales resources based on demand.
