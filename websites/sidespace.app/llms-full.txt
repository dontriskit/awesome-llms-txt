This works like a charm. I installed it, clicked "Group by AI", and seconds later I had a list of various tab groups all on the right side of my browser (you can choose left in Chrome preferences) just like I wanted. While the AI grouping isn't 100%, that's down to the AI and not the developers. It works really well, looks good, and even managed to find ten duplicate tabs (!) that I had open that it offered to close for me. (I took it up on the offer.) It didn't touch my pinned tabs and even put little icons at the top for all those. (It leaves the tabs at the top as well, not something I initially expected or wanted, but I'm okay with it and I don't know that it could be changed.) My browser looks better than it ever has before and there's a handy search bar as well!

Must leave a review after first time used & purchased Early Bird alrd. Cool! But please make minimal & colorable UI same as SideTab Pro - Vertical Tabs. Also please make Mobile / Tablet App / Safari Extention to sync with Bookmarks on Mobile / Tablet with Share Shorcut without any typing Save action (Toby need), I always research on Mobile and Tablet. Bookmarks / Tabs / Notes / Todolist are must things should go together. Hope it usefull after I purchased this awesome extension.

I like this sidebar extension because it can coexist with the browser window, so I don't have to worry about it disappearing when switching tabs. The pinned tab design is really great, and the grouping feature based on domain names is very practical. I hope more useful features can be added. 👍👍

FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

Need help with something? Here are our most frequently asked questions.

How does the product work?

Good question, why we need a tab manager that live in your side panel. But when you have used the [Vertical tabs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/vertical-tabs) in Microsoft Edge browser or the [Window Panel](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/tabs/window-panel/) in Vivaldi browser, you will understand, because using a side panel to manage tabs is really convenient.

Side Space is a Chrome browser extension created to fill the empty side panel area. It provides tab management capabilities in this previously unused space.

Why do I need to sign in?

Side Space currently offer two optional third-party login options, Google and GitHub. Logging in with these accounts allows you to sync your data to the cloud.

This means that when you log in to another browser or device with your account, your saved spaces will be synchronized.

What does "lifetime" mean?

Once you have purchased the License, you will have access to all of the future updates, free of charge. We'll let you know when updates and improvements are made.

Is it a one-time payment?

Just a one-time payment! No recurring charges or surprises, we promise.

Is there a free version available?

Yes, we offer a free version of Side Space for you to try. With this version, you can create and manage up to 5 spaces for your tabs and up to 1000 URLs for AI Grouping.

What is your refund policy?

If there are any serious issues with the license, reach out and let us know via support@side.space within 7-days and we'll issue a full refund.

You'll no longer be able to saving or access more than 5 spaces if we issue a refund. But we can help you saving the tabs in the cloud for 30-days in case you want to recover your spaces again. We think that's pretty fair! You can read the full refund policy in the License Agreement.

## [Revolutionizing Your Browsing Experience with Group Guard Settings](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/introducing-group-guard-settings\#revolutionizing-your-browsing-experience-with-group-guard-settings)

We're excited to announce a powerful new feature for the Side Space extension: Group Guard Settings. Group Guard Settings is a new functionality that allows users to define their own rules for grouping URLs. With this feature, you can create custom categories based on your unique browsing habits and preferences. This function empowers users to take control of their browsing experience by customizing how URLs are grouped and categorized. This feature complements our AI Grouping function. It's designed for users who want to prioritize specific grouping rules or aren't fully satisfied with the AI Grouping results. With Group Guard Settings, you can fine-tune your groupings to achieve a more perfect organization.

Let's dive into what this means for you and how it can transform the way you organize your online world.

## [How to Use Group Guard Settings](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/introducing-group-guard-settings\#how-to-use-group-guard-settings)

Setting up your custom groups is straightforward:

1. Access the Side Space extension settings.
2. Navigate to the new "Group Guard Settings" section.

![Access the Side Space extension settings.](https://www.sidespace.app/blog_009_01.webp)

1. Click "Add Group" to create a custom category.

![Click "Add Group" to create a custom category.](https://www.sidespace.app/blog_009_02.webp)

1. Name your group (e.g., "Work", "Social Media", "Research").
2. Define the URL pattern for this group using [match pattern structure](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns):

match patterns consist of three parts: _scheme_, _host_, and _path_. The scheme and host are separated by `://`.

`<scheme>://<host><path>`

a. The _scheme_ component may take one of two forms:

| Form | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `*` | Only "http" and "https" and in some browsers also ["ws" and "wss"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). |
| `http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`, `ftp`, `data`, `file`, or `(chrome-)extension`. | Only the given scheme. |

b. The _host_ component may take one of three forms:

| Form | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `*` | Any host. |
| `*.` followed by part of the hostname. | The given host and any of its subdomains. |
| A complete hostname, without wildcards. | Only the given host. |

**\*Note that the wildcard** `*` **may only appear at the start.**

c. The _path_ component must begin with a `/`.

After that, it may subsequently contain any combination of the `*` wildcard and any of the characters that are allowed in URL paths or query strings. Unlike _host_, the _path_ component may contain the `*` wildcard in the middle or at the end, and the `*` wildcard may appear more than once.

1. Save your settings and watch as Side Space automatically categorizes your tabs!

## [Match pattern examples](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/introducing-group-guard-settings\#match-pattern-examples)

1. `*.google.com` **or** `*.google.com/*`

Matches any URL that is on a google.com host, with any path. Examples of matches include `http://mail.google.com` or `https://chromewebstore.google.com` or `https://www.google.com/chrome/ai-innovations/`

2. `https://*.google.com/search?*ai*`

Matches any URL using the `https` scheme, on a google.com host, with a path that starts with `search` and contains the keyword `ai`. Examples of matches include `https://www.google.com/search?q=ai`

3. `https://*/*ai*`

Matches any URL using the `https` scheme, on any host, with a path that contains `ai`. Examples of matches include `https://www.google.com/search?q=ai` and  `https://www.bing.com/search?q=ai` and `https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=ai`.

## [How to Combine Group Guard Settings with AI Grouping](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/introducing-group-guard-settings\#how-to-combine-group-guard-settings-with-ai-grouping)

To better categorize your tabs, start by customizing rules with our Group Guard Settings feature. Then, use the AI Grouping Settings to automatically categorize the remaining tabs that don't match your custom rules.

To avoid conflicts between custom rules and AI Grouping results, you can enable a button `Filter out the grouped tabs` in the AI Grouping Settings. This ensures that when you use the AI Grouping feature, it won't affect or move tabs that are already categorized by your custom rules.

![How to Combine Group Guard Settings with AI Grouping](https://www.sidespace.app/blog_009_03.webp)

## [Why Group Guard Settings Matter](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/introducing-group-guard-settings\#why-group-guard-settings-matter)

### [**Side Space: An Arc-Like Experience Across Multiple Browsers**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-arc-browser-sidebar\#side-space-an-arc-like-experience-across-multiple-browsers)

### [**Key Differences Between Arc Browser and Side Space**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-arc-browser-sidebar\#key-differences-between-arc-browser-and-side-space)

### [**1\. Platform Compatibility**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-arc-browser-sidebar\#_1-platform-compatibility)

- **Arc Browser**: As a standalone browser, Arc combines a unique interface with built-in features for tab organization and workspace customization. However, it’s exclusive to users who fully adopt Arc’s ecosystem, limiting compatibility with other browsers.
- **Side Space**: Side Space works as a **Chrome extension**, integrating seamlessly with Google Chrome and other `Chromium-based browsers`. Its flexibility allows users to enjoy advanced features across multiple platforms without the need to switch to a new browser.

- **Side Space**: Goes beyond by providing **`cloud-based syncing`** across browsers and devices, allowing users to manage tabs and groups seamlessly on multiple Chromium-based browsers.

### [**4\. Customization Options**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-arc-browser-sidebar\#_4-customization-options)

- **Arc Browser**: Boasts visually stunning customization features, including themed workspaces and a tailored sidebar. However, these options are specific to Arc’s interface and may not appeal to users preferring a more traditional layout.
- **Side Space**: Offers practical customization options, such as **`dark mode`**, **`custom themes`**, and `tab suspension`. These features are designed to blend seamlessly with Chrome’s interface, making it ideal for users who want enhanced functionality without overhauling their browsing experience.

### [**Who Should Choose Arc Browser?**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-arc-browser-sidebar\#who-should-choose-arc-browser)

- Users seeking an all-in-one, standalone browser with a focus on visual organization.
- Those who prefer a workspace-oriented approach to managing tabs and tasks.
- Individuals willing to switch entirely to Arc’s ecosystem.

### [**Who Should Choose Side Space?**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-arc-browser-sidebar\#who-should-choose-side-space)

- Anyone seeking a minimalist, intuitive interface with **`cross-browser syncing`**.

### [**Conclusion**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-arc-browser-sidebar\#conclusion)

Both Arc Browser and Side Space offer innovative approaches to **tab management** and workspace organization. If you’re already in the Arc ecosystem or are willing to adopt its unique browser, Arc is a great choice for a visually-driven experience. On the other hand, If you’re looking for a way to bring Arc’s organizational prowess to your current browser, Side Space delivers. Its sleek side panel mimics Arc’s vertical tab layout while incorporating advanced features like AI grouping, memory management, and syncing across browsers.

Furthermore, as The Arc Browser Company shifts its focus to developing a new browser, Arc will no longer receive new features, though it will continue to get stability and security updates.

This transition has led many advanced users, who found Arc's features invaluable, to seek alternatives. Side Space emerges as a compelling solution, allowing users to replicate Arc's sidebar functionalities within their preferred Chromium-based browsers. By integrating features like AI-powered tab grouping and vertical tab management directly into the browser's side panel, Side Space offers a seamless and efficient browsing experience without the need to switch to a new browser. This enables users to continue enjoying a customized, Arc-like interface while leveraging the performance and familiarity of browsers like Chrome.

### [Why using Vertical Tabs](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-edge-vertical-tabs\#why-using-vertical-tabs)

**Say Goodbye to Tab Clutter**

Vertical tabs provide a smart solution for managing your browser space, reducing the chaos of a crowded tab bar while freeing up more visible on-screen area.

**Quickly Spot the Tabs You Need**

When your tab bar is overflowing, horizontal tabs shrink to the point where their labels are unreadable. Vertical tabs solve this issue by offering ample room to display tab titles clearly, making it easier and faster to locate the one you need.

**Optimize Your Screen Layout**

Most monitors are wider than they are tall, which makes top-to-bottom space more limited. Shifting your tabs to a vertical layout takes advantage of the extra width on your screen, allowing you to make better use of the available space.

### [Detailed Comparison](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-edge-vertical-tabs\#detailed-comparison)

Here’s a detailed comparison of `Edge Vertical Tabs` and **`Side Space`**, highlighting their features and functionalities:

| **Feature** | **Edge Vertical Tabs** | **Side Space** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vertical Tab Management** | Native support for vertical tabs, providing a clean and collapsible layout for managing open tabs. | Advanced vertical tab management with additional features like `categorized spaces` and AI-powered tab grouping. |
| **Tab Organization** | Basic organization with the ability to rearrange and pin tabs. | Organizes tabs into customizable `spaces` with the ability to group related tabs by `AI` automatically. |
| **AI-Powered Grouping** | Organize tabs but not accurate. | Automatically organizes tabs by context—like topics or tasks—using a `high-quality AI model`, ensuring seamless navigation and better organization. |
| **Customization Options** | Limited; focuses on a simple vertical layout with basic visual options. | Offers extensive customization, including themes, icons, `dark mode`, and tailored space layouts. |
| **Tab Suspension** | Auto suspension, but don’t allow users to manually suspend tabs. | Allows users to `suspend all tabs` by one click to save memory and restore them as needed. |
| **Search Functionality** | Basic tab search within the browser, showing results for currently open tabs. | Includes `global and fuzzy search`, making it easier to find tabs quickly. |
| **Cross-Device Sync** | Syncs tabs across devices via a Microsoft account but requires manual reopening on other devices. | Automatically `syncs` spaces and tab groups across multiple devices and browsers for seamless browsing workflows. |
| **Integration with Other Features** | Fully integrated into Edge with features like Collections and browser settings. | Focused solely on optimizing tab management, without integrating additional browser utilities. |
| **Browser Compatibility** | Exclusive to Microsoft Edge. | Works on Chrome and other `Chromium-based` browsers like Edge, Chrome, Brave and Vivaldi. |

### [**Key Differences**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-edge-vertical-tabs\#key-differences)

**1\. AI Grouping**

- **Edge Vertical Tabs**: Offers a basic "Organize Tabs" feature, but the grouping results often feel random and lack precision.
- **Side Space**: Leverages a `high-quality AI model` to deliver smarter, more accurate tab grouping. Users can even customize categories for tailored organization.

Here’s a comparison of the AI grouping results from **Edge Vertical Tabs** vs. **Side Space** for the same set of tabs:

![Edge Vertical Tabs vs Side Space](https://www.sidespace.app/blog_012_01.webp)

> Brave Vertical Tabs vs Side Space

1. **Customization and Feature Depth**:
   - Edge Vertical Tabs focus on simplicity and ease of use.
   - Side Space offers extensive customization, catering to users who want more control over their browsing environment. Such as `custom themes`, `dark mode`, and `duplicate tab removal`, `group by domain`, `import/export`.
2. **Compatibility**:
   - Edge Vertical Tabs are tied to the Edge browser.
   - Side Space works as a Chrome extension, making it compatible with various Chromium-based browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Brave. For users who switch between browsers, Side Space offers `seamless synchronization`, ensuring your tab groups stay consistent across platforms.

## [**Which One to Choose?**](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-edge-vertical-tabs\#which-one-to-choose)

- **Edge Vertical Tabs**: A great choice for users seeking a straightforward vertical tab layout with minimal features. Best suited for light users or those who primarily use Edge.
- **Side Space**: Perfect for advanced users and multitaskers who need enhanced tab management, robust organization, and seamless cross-device syncing.

If you’re juggling numerous tabs and projects, **Side Space** offers the tools to keep you organized and efficient.

## [Introduction: Efficiently Managing Browser Tabs](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/how-to-manage-hundreds-tabs-in-your-browser-without-losing-your-mind\#introduction-efficiently-managing-browser-tabs)

Tabs are indispensable for browsing, and many users frequently have a dozen or more open simultaneously. However, some users, like developer Tom, manage hundreds of tabs in a single session. Utilizing various browser extensions, Tom has transformed potential chaos into an organized browsing experience, effortlessly navigating through his browsing history and tasks.

## [A New Way to Handle Multiple Tabs](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/how-to-manage-hundreds-tabs-in-your-browser-without-losing-your-mind\#a-new-way-to-handle-multiple-tabs)

The concept of tabbed browsing has evolved, with browsers like Microsoft Edge enhancing the experience through features like collections, vertical tabs, and **sleeping** tabs. Vivaldi has also introduced innovations such as **Accordion Tabs**, with similar improvements available in Chrome.

The primary issue with having too many tabs is that it can significantly slow down your PC. Each tab uses memory, and with a large number of them open, performance can suffer as memory runs out, affecting your workflow.

That’s not the only problem: with so many tabs open, navigating between them becomes difficult. Favicon is helpful, but when tab widths shrink, it becomes challenging to identify which one you're viewing.

![](https://www.sidespace.app/blog_006_01.jpg)

## [How Extensions Help](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/how-to-manage-hundreds-tabs-in-your-browser-without-losing-your-mind\#how-extensions-help)

Tom detailed how he uses several **Chrome extensions** to solve these issues. One example is the **Tab Deck** extension, which provides **vertical tab** organization, akin to an enhanced version of **One Tab**. A key feature is the ability to save tabs as sessions, which can **sync to the cloud**, allowing you to switch devices and retain your browsing tabs.

For more on **Tab Deck**, check out [this detailed review](https://www.onetab.group/).

## [Managing Memory Usage with Side Space](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/how-to-manage-hundreds-tabs-in-your-browser-without-losing-your-mind\#managing-memory-usage-with-side-space)

Memory consumption increases with more open tabs, and this is where extensions like **Side Space** come in.

What’s great about Side Space is that it organizes tabs into **spaces**, similar to virtual desktops, helping you compartmentalize your browsing session. Your browser tabs are neatly organized into **separate categories** for work, life, shopping, school, and hobbies. To make your thoughts clearer, focus on the present space.

Side Space also allows you to **unload** tabs, similar to Edge’s sleeping tabs. This means tabs remain accessible but don’t consume memory, enabling you to open new tabs without slowing down your PC. This approach helps you manage numerous tabs in browsers like Chrome, improving performance and maintaining a smooth workflow.

## [Conclusion: Efficiently Managing Browser Tabs](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/how-to-manage-hundreds-tabs-in-your-browser-without-losing-your-mind\#conclusion-efficiently-managing-browser-tabs)

Effectively managing numerous browser tabs is achievable with the right tools and techniques. By leveraging browser features and extensions like **Tab Deck** and **Side Space**, you can maintain an organized, efficient browsing experience without compromising performance.

## [Why using Vertical Tabs](https://www.sidespace.app/blog/compare-to-brave-vertical-tabs\#why-using-vertical-tabs)

**Say Goodbye to Tab Clutter**

Vertical tabs provide a smart solution for managing your browser space, reducing the chaos of a crowded tab bar while freeing up more visible on-screen area.

**Quickly Spot the Tabs You Need**

When your tab bar is overflowing, horizontal tabs shrink to the point where their labels are unreadable. Vertical tabs solve this issue by offering ample room to display tab titles clearly, making it easier and faster to locate the one you need.

**Optimize Your Screen Layout**

Most monitors are wider than they are tall, which makes top-to-bottom space more limited. Shifting your tabs to a vertical layout takes advantage of the extra width on your screen, allowing you to make better use of the available space.
