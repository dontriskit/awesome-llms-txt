# FAQ with IMM Quality Boat Lifts

## At IMM Quality Boat Lifts, we hear plenty of questions from boating enthusiasts who are looking for the world's best boat lifts. Here are the most common questions that our clients ask about boat lifts for sale.

1\. Why do I want or need a boat lift?

Keeping a boat on a lift will prevent the need for bottom-painting the boat. Bottom painting reduces the value of your boat. You will also save on storage fees, wrapping and winterizing fees, while having year-around availability to launch your boat. Your boatlift will also better protect your boat from storm damage, theft, and vandalism. Most people are surprised to find that installing a boatlift costs much less than they originally figured. In most cases, boatlifts pay for themselves within five years!

2\. What capacity lift should I buy?

IMM Quality Boat Lifts are measured by capacity in pounds, rather than the length of the boat. Once you’ve calculated the fully-loaded wet weight of your boat, you can [figure out a boat lift capacity](https://iqboatlifts.com/boat-lift-capacity-calculator/) that will safely handle your boat. You should consider what size boat you may be upgrading to over the next few years before purchasing your lift. If you’re not sure about the weight of your boat, please look at our lift selector on the contact page, or contact us directly at [1-800-545-5603](tel:+18005455603). IMM Quality Boat Lifts for sale can accommodate most any boat, from a PWC to the largest yacht!

3\. What is better, aluminum lifts or galvanized steel lifts?

In the saltwater environment, marine-grade aluminum (6061-T6) offers a greatly increased life expectancy when compared to galvanized steel. When [aluminum boat lifts](https://iqboatlifts.com/elevator-lifts/alumavator-elevator-lift/) were first introduced, the primary drawback to aluminum has cost. The large structural shapes needed were hard to obtain, increasing boat lift costs. As structural aluminum became more common, the aluminum boat lift cost decreased and is now similar to the price of galvanized lifts. Also, the lightweight properties of aluminum allow the contractors to sometimes install IMM Quality’s boat lifts without a barge or crane, significantly lowering installation costs. Today, there is really no reason to purchase a galvanized boat lift.

4\. Will the cradles on an aluminum lift float?

If a boat lift is selected with wooden bunks, IMM Quality Boat Lifts will send weights to insure that the cradles will not float. IMM Quality Boat Lifts’ revolutionary Perma-Bunk aluminum bunks, which come with white vinyl covers, prevent any cradle-floatation. The aluminum bunks and covers are guaranteed for 10 years. While there are inferior aluminum bunks available, they don’t incorporate a custom extrusion “internal I beam” structure. This piece integrates the white vinyl covers perfectly, without the need for top rivets that might scratch your hull.

5\. When should I use an elevator style boat lift? Are there any drawbacks?

Elevator boat lifts do not require outboard pilings, allowing elevators to be used where outboard pilings are not permitted, in cases with hard-bottom or deep-water conditions that make the installation of piles impractical. Additionally, elevator boat lifts work in cases where there just isn’t enough room to access a traditional four-post boat lift. A disadvantage of elevator boat lifts is that the tracks stay in the water. Therefore, they need to be protected from electrolysis and the ground voltage. Learn more about [How Does an Elevator Lift Work?](https://iqboatlifts.com/how-does-an-elevator-lift-work/)

6\. I need an elevator lift for my application, why choose an IMM Quality elevator?

IMM Quality Boat Lifts is recognized as the industry leader in the manufacturing of [elevator boat lifts](https://iqboatlifts.com/elevator-lifts/). The key to a good elevator boat lift design is the strength of the joint between the trolley and cradle arm. Please see the webpage depicting our elevator lifts for details and pictures. Note how the joint is reinforced, making it the strongest in the industry. Also, you’ll see how the boat lift design also allows you to bring your personal watercraft up closer to the dock than any other elevator lifts for sale. [How Does an Elevator Lift Work?](https://iqboatlifts.com/how-does-an-elevator-lift-work/)

7\. Under what circumstances are beamless boat lifts the better choice?

At first glance, a [beamless boat lift](https://iqboatlifts.com/beamless-lifts/) may seem the better choice because there is no “top beam” to navigate across when entering the boat or to see from the house. While this is true, there is a trade-off for that benefit, tied to how the boat lift works. When winch heads are attached to the sides of the pilings, they exert a side load on the pilings. Therefore, the dock structure and installed pilings (especially external free-standing pilings) need to be installed properly. They also need to have sufficient construction to withstand this sideways force. If not, pilings may tend to lean over, or even shift, due to the side loading. IMM Quality’s conventional top beam boat lifts can be set in a “low-profile” configuration, which allows you to use a covered top beam as a boarding platform while avoiding the side load issues associated with beamless lifts.

8\. What types of drive shaft bearings are best?

There are basically three types of drive shaft bearings to consider.

1. **Ball or roller bearings** may seem great, but they are not durable because of corrosion and because they are not engineered for low-RPM, high-load conditions.
2. Another type is **metal-to-metal.** Some manufacturers use bronze, while some use aluminum or even plastic bearings. In both cases, they require frequent lubrication and maintenance. We feel that a boat lift should free up your time, not use it up with additional chores.
3. Maintenance-free, engineered polymer bearings are a very high-tech, self-lubricating material. IMM Quality Boat Lifts have used these bearings for many years, and our Igus tribopolymer bearings have never worn out. They are dirt-resistant, corrosion-free and quiet, reducing maintenance costs and increasing the service life of our boat lifts.

For these reasons, IMM Quality Boat Lifts uses maintenance-free Igus bearings on all of boat lifts for sale.

9\. What is the lead time for boat lift development?

All IMM Quality Boat Lifts are made in the U.S.A. While the manufacturing process usually requires a 2-3 week period, this timeline may vary based on seasonality and supply chain and this estimate does not include transportation or lift installation. Once your lift is manufactured, it will be transported to your installer. Your installer is responsible for establishing and advising your about a timeline for boat lift installation.

10\. Do I need a permit?

Most jurisdictions require a permit before installing a boat lift. Your contractor will be aware of the requirements and local codes and can easily guide you through the process for how boat lifts work.

11\. I noticed that IMM Quality boat lifts are sold through dealers. Why should I buy from a marine contractor and can I buy direct from the factory?

IMM Quality Boat Lifts strongly recommends that our customers use a [qualified dealer to install their boat lift](https://iqboatlifts.com/dealer-locator/).  Boat lifts are fixed to pilings, docks or seawalls, and require significant skill and experience to install properly. A licensed contractor will be able to handle all aspects of the lift installation, including setting pilings, evaluating existing structures for lift suitability and obtaining the proper permits with the authorities.

However, there may be situations where a homeowner either has a contractor that they are more comfortable with, or can even handle their own installation. IMM Quality Boat Lifts can sell direct under these circumstances. All the risk and liability will be borne to any person self-installing the boat lift, or by a contractor that is not approved by IMM Quality Boat Lifts.

Please let us know if you are already working with a contractor. IMM Quality Boat Lifts always tries to ensure that our approved dealers are providing customers with the highest level of service available, and your feedback is important to us. If you choose to use your own contractor, please be sure to thoroughly check your contractor’s credentials and recent references before entering into a contract.

12\. How do I operate and maintain my boat lift?

Once the boat lift installation is complete, your contractor will train you on the safe operation and maintenance of your new boat lift. If you ever have operational questions, contact IMM Quality Boat Lifts technical staff at [1-800-545-5603](tel:+18005455603). Owner’s Manuals for your specific boat lift are supplied with your lift and are also available in the documentation section of our website.

13\. I’ve seen cheaper boat lifts being made locally and others that are sold over the internet. Why pay more for IMM Quality Boat Lifts?

In short, you get what you pay for. Often, the boat lifts sold over the internet are used. After the downturn in the housing market, people began taking boat lifts from foreclosed properties and reselling them. Sometimes, they are not advertised as used.  Anyone can clean up aluminum nicely and easily with an acid wash. So, be careful that you understand what you are buying and how the boat lifts work. The motors and gearboxes should remain in good functioning order.

In order to undercut the market, some competitors are having their boat lifts manufactured in third-world countries and shipped into the United States for distribution. On the other hand, IMM Quality Boat Lifts are [built to order and manufactured in Fort Myers, Florida](https://iqboatlifts.com/how-imm-quality-builds-the-worlds-best-boat-lifts-2/) in the United States of America. We are proud that our boat lifts are made in the U.S., and we are committed to keeping high-quality jobs in this country.

Many smaller lift manufacturers are little more than garage shops, which may or may not be there when you need parts or service.  The “other guys” will talk about their years of experience in the industry. IMM Quality Boat Lifts has been in business since 1982. We are here to stay. In fact, some of our past competitors have come to work for us!

There is one key difference between IMM Quality Boat Lifts and its competitors. We are the industry’s innovator and our engineers, machinists and fabricators are masters of their trade. IMM Quality’s state-of-the-art, 30,000-square-foot factory and 12,000-square-foot test facility produce and test boat lifts with features and technology unavailable anywhere else.

Outstanding craftmanship and quality boat lift, by far one of the best companies I have experienced in a long time. I would highly recommend that anyone looking to buy a new one or replace their boat lift, talk to IMM Quality Boat Lifts. Lastly, the design and materials they use and what you don’t see (inside the engine box), is exceptional. Not only does our new dock looks great, the boat lift is built to last!

My experience with IMM Quality Boat Lifts has been nothing but exceptional. They were prompt, very professional, and understanding of my specific needs. I was looking to purchase a boat lift for my whaler and researched numerous dealers and manufacturers. This company has gone above and beyond my expectations. I would recommend them to anyone and have done so to several close friends. All were extremely satisfied!

# Specialty Boat Lifts

Specialty boat lifts are designed for certain applications where the standard vertical or elevator boat lift is not the most appropriate method of lift, due to restrictions or personal preferences.

IMM Quality Boat Lifts currently manufactures three types of specialty boat lifts. Each one is unique to a specific application. The **Trident** specialty boat lift is a three-post lift designed to comply with triangular riparian setback limitations. The Trident specialty boat lifts allow easy navigation in and out of the boat slip. The **Beamless** specialty boat lift is preferred by many homeowners, because there are no upper lifting beams to duck under or step over when accessing the boat. Another advantage to not having an upper lifting beam is that there is no obstruction of the waterway view. Finally, the **Marine Railway** is ideal for beach access or other gradual slope conditions where there are no deep water docks or seawalls. This unique type of specialty boat lift is often used to pull boats or seaplanes onto dry land, into boat houses or inside garages.

# Trident Boat Lifts

IMM Quality Boat Lift’s engineers came up with the innovative Trident boat lift, a 3-pole design, in consultation with marine contractors and homeowners.

Trident boat lifts are ideally suited for the ends of canals where waterway rights are limited to pie-shaped wedges. The Trident boatlift and its 3-pole design satisfies triangular riparian setback limitations and allows maximum slip utilization with easy navigation in and out of the slip. All Trident boat lifts for sale are powered by the Platinum drive, an aluminum double worm transmission, for a maintenance-free direct drive-to-shaft connection. Furthermore, the Trident boat lift is available with a double speed drive, making IMM Quality’s superiority all the more pronounced.

IMM Quality Boat Lifts takes pride in our engineering and product design expertise. We also bring the unique capability to thoroughly performance test our Trident boatlifts before they leave our factory. Take a look at the Trident lift design, and see why IMM Quality Boat Lifts are built for a lifetime.

Built to last a lifetime, the IMM Quality vertical boat lifts are currently the most efficient design for a cable-drawn lift to date. Our **vertical boat lifts** were developed a couple of decades ago, and have quickly become the industry standard.

The IMM Quality vertical boat lift can be recognized by its parallel upper beams. Each contains a motor-driven shaft through their length, on which four cables are wound. The cables are connected to the four corners of the boat cradle, which is raised or lowered by a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the shaft. Our top-beam vertical boat lifts can be set in a “low-profile” configuration, which allows you to use a covered top beam as a boarding platform for easy access to your boat.

## **Launch or dock your kayak from the seawall with our NEW Kayak Launch Lift!**

You most likely love to be on the water, enjoying the scenery, discovering new things and breathing in the fresh air as you explore in your kayak. Getting in your kayak is a different story. Is your dock too high to safely launch your kayak? Does your dock even have a ladder down to the water? Have you come up with a method to launch your kayak that is very awkward and uncomfortable? Have you seen a kayak dock lift from other manufacturers that looks poorly made, shakes and wobbles, and quite frankly, looks unsafe to operate?

Do you find yourself using your kayak less than you would like because of these issues? Are you ready to kayak without these aggravations?

### Our Commitment: Built for a Lifetime

The old adage “you get what you pay for” couldn’t be more true when it comes to IMM quality boat lifts. When our IMM Quality engineers design the first boat lift back in 1982, they engineer it to work smarter than all other lifts, and to exceed the toughest building codes. Heavier materials, all aluminum structural components, stainless steel cables and hardware, welded construction, etc. It is attention to detail that really sets our lifts apart.

With continuous improvement based on our extensive experience on customer’s needs, we have perfected the art of building the best lifts in the industry! Why all the fuss?

Relax with an IMM Quality intelligent design, and spend your weekends doing what you love.

# Beamless Lifts

Beamless boat lifts are preferred by many homeowners, because there are no beams to avoid when boarding the boat or to obstruct the view of the waterway. IMM Quality’s beamless boatlift system has four individual powerheads to allow independent adjustment at all corners. Our beamless boat lift utilizes the Platinum drive, an aluminum double worm transmission for a maintenance-free direct drive-to-shaft connection. Furthermore, the beamless boat lifts are available with a double-speed drive, making IMM Quality’s superiority all the more pronounced.

Unlike our competitors, we do not use load-bearing, underwater cable tie-offs. This design flaw makes the competitor’s beamless boatlifts difficult to install, inspect and service. It also decreases the durability and safety of the beamless lift by unnecessarily keeping these load bearing parts under water, where they are subject to corrosion and electrolysis. IMM Quality Boat Lifts takes pride in our engineering and product design expertise, along with our unique capability to thoroughly performance-test our beamless boat lifts before they leave our factory. Take a look at our design, and see why IMM Quality Boat Lifts are built to last a lifetime.

# Boat Lifting - The History Of Boat Lifts

## From Ancient Pulley Systems to Modern Hydraulic Lifts: A Historical Overview of Boat Lifting Technology

Before the mid-1970s, boats were typically lifted with a pair of davits. These crane-like structures are mounted to a piling or set in the ground above a sea wall. They utilize a fore and an aft cable, which are connected to lifting eyes on the watercraft.

Boaters find davits difficult to use, as the distance between connecting points on the boat make them challenging for one person to operate. Davits are used today for lifting smaller watercraft in some unique situations. However, their position as the industry standard has been largely replaced by lifts that support the boat on bunk boards connected to a lifting platform or cradle system.

A major breakthrough in boat lift design occurred in the 1980s. Aluminum was introduced as a structural material to replace galvanized steel. Although slightly more expensive than steel, its long-term appearance and corrosion resistance make it a superior alternative.

Today, the best boat lifts are made from aluminum. It has steadily supplanted galvanized steel, as consumers have become knowledgeable enough to recognize its superiority.

### **The Modern History of Boat Lifts**

Over the last 40 years, a number of methods to lift a boat with a cradle system have been developed for marine lift applications. Hydraulic cylinders, pneumatic flotation and wound cables have been explored in various configurations. Hydraulic boat lifts have been found to be difficult to protect from saltwater corrosion, susceptible to oil leakage and relatively expensive.

Piling or sea wall mounted cable-drawn boat lifts have become the choice in coastal waters. They lift the boat free of the water in minimal space at an affordable price. Of course, a number of ingenious cable routing and structural techniques have been developed by IMM Quality engineers.

[Our boat lifts are intelligently designed and rigorously tested](https://iqboatlifts.com/how-imm-quality-builds-the-worlds-best-boat-lifts-2/) at our in-house facility, field tested by more than 25,000 lifts during over 40 years in business, and continuously refined by our engineers based on feedback from our customers.

# Elevator Boat Lifts

**Elevator Boat** **Lifts** are used on restricted waterfronts where outboard pilings are not allowed, such as on narrow canals. Elevator boat lifts are also used where the driving of pilings is difficult due to hard-bottom conditions.

[**Get a boat lift quote online**](https://iqboatlifts.com/boat-lift-quotes/)

IMM Quality elevator boat lifts can be mounted on seawalls or pilings, and in a vertical or inclined position. Our elevator boat lifts are gusseted using one-inch thick billet aluminum plates that have CNC-machined channels that accept the upper and lower flanges of the elevator boat lift’s carriage I-beam (see video below).

No other manufacturer has this feature on elevator boat lifts for sale. Not only does this provide mechanical support for the I-beam, but it also guarantees the correct geometry in all three dimensions. It also fixes the proper angles for the arms. With IMM Quality’s superior manufacturing capabilities, there is no need to worry about over stressed welds or your elevator arms being out of alignment.

## **Types of Elevator Boat Lifts**

IMM Quality Boat Lifts currently offers three types of elevator boat lifts. These are the Alumavator boat lift, including its select model; the Platinum elevator lift and the Superlift elevator boat lift.

The **Alumavator / Select** is IMM Quality’s battle-tested chain drive lift. Elevator boat lift prices for this Alumavator Select model are our most economical, even though it comes with many features other companies consider optional upgrades.

The **Platinum** elevator lift is our maintenance-free, direct drive lift with all the bells and whistles.

The **Superlift** is a rugged, industrial-duty gearless elevator boat lift system. Originally designed for marina applications, it is the fastest, most efficient lift on the market and is the lift of choice for the most discerning boaters.

![The Benefits of a Covered Drive 10](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Benefits-of-a-Covered-Drive.jpg)

# The Benefits of a Covered Drive

- [May 19, 2017](https://iqboatlifts.com/2017/05/19/)
- [Boat Lifts](https://iqboatlifts.com/boat-lifts/)

There can be little doubt that Mother Nature will ruin machinery if it is not protected properly. A marine environment is particularly harsh and most people realize how damaging corrosion and electrolysis can be to boats. However, few realize just how vulnerable boat lift drive systems are to environmental degradation. The drive system components that are most vulnerable are the motors, gearboxes and the moving parts (e.g. sprockets, chains, belts, etc.). Let’s take a look at what can happen to unprotected drive systems, especially the motors.

### General Benefits of a Cover

![IMM Quality Boat Lift Cover](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMM-Quality-Boat-Lift-Cover.jpg)IMM Quality Cover

The IMM Quality Boat Lifts covers have been specially designed to protect and preserve the drive components. The covers are made from high-density polyethylene to provide chemical, U.V. and corrosion resistance. The U.V. protection will minimize fading, sun damage and reflect heat from the sun to lower the surface temperature of the drive components, thus protecting the motors from overheating. We use a roto-molding process to make the covers extra thick to provide the highest level of impact resistance and durability. They will protect your drive components from rocks, lures, limbs, aerial assaults from birds, sea salt, and the elements while keeping everything looking new.

**Harsh marine environment quickly ruins uncovered drive components**

![boat lift drives over time](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/boat-lift-drives-over-time.jpg)

The covers also protect the drive components from grime and grit.  The housing of the gear boxes are made from cast aluminum so exposure to the elements simply affects the cosmetic appearance.  However, the drive shaft from the gearbox is made from carbon steel so that it can withstand the torque.  This drive shaft along with its seals is vulnerable to breaking down in a marine environment and protecting them with a cover greatly extends the life of the gearbox.  In addition, the sprockets and many other drive components require lubrication to allow them to turn easily and to protect them from corrosion.

![grit on boat lift motor](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/grit-on-boat-lift-motor.jpg)How much grit is on the inside of the motor? This much.

Open drive systems allow the weather to wash away the lubrication, necessitating more frequent [maintenance](https://iqboatlifts.com/boat-lift-maintenance/) with re-application of lubricant, otherwise, the moving parts will make loud noises and will eventually bind.  Open drive systems also allow grit to accumulate on the components which will wear down the sprockets, sheaves and other moving parts much more quickly than when they are protected by a cover.  With all this grime and grit it is a good thing that the IMM Quality covers were designed to be simple to clean using just a mild detergent and water.

### Motors

There are many kinds of motors, but the types most commonly used by boat lift manufacturers are open drip proof (ODP), totally enclosed (either non-ventilated (TENV) or fan cooled (TEFC)), stainless steel and extreme duty washdown motors.

![Extreme Duty Washdown Motor](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Extreme-Duty-Washdown-Motor.jpg)If you can afford it, an extreme duty washdown motor is the absolute best choice for a boat lift.  All exterior components are made of stainless steel, along with weather resistant seals and all the other internal components are engineered to resist environmental contamination and corrosion.  As the name suggests, these motors are designed to be washed down with a hose while they are running.  The only real problem is that they cost four times more than a good TEFC motor.  Most consumers cannot justify spending thousands of dollars more on their boat lift for these premium motors.

![ODP motors](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ODP-motors.jpg)ODP motors are just that – completely open to the environment.  It’s like an open door from whatever is outside, to your bearings, windings and other components on the inside.  Dirt, soot, rain, ocean spray, etc., it all gets inside.  Wildlife and insects are especially fond of nesting inside these motors (mud daubers really love them).  These are the cheapest kind of motor on the market and they do not use weather resistant components.  ODP motors are often used on cheap flat plate drives and are a terrible choice if the drive system is not protected by a well-sealed cover.

![TENV and TEFC motors](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TENV-and-TEFC-motors.jpg)TENV and TEFC are very similar in design.  Although both of these motors are sealed, the gaskets and other materials are not designed to withstand direct exposure to an outside environment.  The main difference between TENV and TEFC is the fan cooling.  Motors get hot while running and the fan cooling extends the continuous runtime before the motor will overheat.  Typically the non-ventilated TENV motors have rated runtimes of 15 minutes, while the fan-cooled TEFC motors are rated as continuous duty (ie. they can be used continuously, 24 hours a day).  TEFC motors are a great, cost-effective choice when used under a cover.

![Stainless Steel Motors](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/stainless-steel-motor.jpg)Stainless steel motors are frequently used on boat lifts that do not have covers (most commonly TENV versions).  What you should keep in mind is that only the exterior housing, capacitor case, and conduit box cover are made from stainless steel.  The internal parts are not.  This is important because water condenses on the insides of non-covered motors as they cool after use.  Therefore, even stainless steel motors have drain plugs to allow the accumulated water to drip out.  So even though the outside of a stainless steel motor may look nice and rust free, the inside components are frequently ruined by the condensation.

![The Benefits of a Covered Drive 9](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Rusty-windings-rotor-capacitor-1.jpg)Rusty windings, rotor and capacitor from inside an uncovered stainless steel motor

Using a cover essentially eliminates condensation inside a motor.  The cover greatly slows the cooling of the metal, the cover limits the volume of air around the motor and the cover limits the turnover of moist air around the motor by lowering air flow.  To help you understand why covers eliminate condensation, think about your car and how water can condense on it as dew or frost.  Then think about how cars parked inside garages are protected from this condensation.  Even though the garage is not air tight, is not insulated or heated, cars parked in garages do not get frost (in winter) or dew (in summer) on their windshields on the same night cars parked outside do have condensation.  The same scientific principles protect your boat lift drive components from condensation when they are covered.

### Conclusion

There are many reasons why owning a boat lift that has a cover for the drive components is a wise idea.  Covering the drive components will protect them from the elements and greatly extend their service life.  A cover will also preserve the beauty of your motor and gearbox in addition to increasing the resale value of your lift.  A good cover improves the overall aesthetics of the lift giving a sleek, clean look compared to the clunky, industrial look of exposed machinery.  Given all the benefits of a covered drive, why would anyone choose to do otherwise?

# Alumavator Vertical Boat Lifts

A superbly engineered gear-driven boat lift, the IMM Quality Alumavator Vertical Boat Lift **sets the industry standard** for shafted beam boat lifts. The Alumavator vertical boat lift is chain driven at the winder shaft from a motor-driven gearbox.

Chain drives are the transmission of choice for heavy machinery in industrial, farming, military and marine applications, because of the shock-load ruggedness, efficiency, safety and proven battle-tested dependability. This positive drive system does not suffer from the belt slippage seen with flat plate drives. This is because each link makes a drive contact on the sprocket, spreading the load over many teeth. Chains are **simply the best choice** for the money given the extreme abuse of the marine boat lift application.

[IMM Quality Boat Lifts](https://iqboatlifts.com/about/) takes pride in our engineering and product design expertise, along with our unique capability to thoroughly performance test our lifts before they leave the IMM Quality Boat Lifts factory. Just take a look at the IMM Quality Alumavator boat lift design to see why our vertical boat lifts are **built for a lifetime**.

# SUPERLIFT VERTICAL BOAT LIFTS

From the all-aluminum powerhead cover to its massive beams, one look at the rugged components and it is easy to see that the Superlift vertical boatlift is the finest industrial duty boat lift ever made. The Superlift was designed for extended frequent use in marinas, but it has gained a following among the most discriminating homeowners.

The Superlift vertical boat lift system incorporates a gearless, high-efficiency cycloidal drive that generates 34,700,inch pounds of output torque at an efficiency of greater than 90%. What does this amazing torque and efficiency mean? The cycloidal drives by [IMM Quality Boat Lifts](https://iqboatlifts.com/about/) are the most powerful on the market, and are the most durable drive system available.

Nothing is faster at lifting your boat than the Superlift vertical boatlift, which is more than twice as fast as the nearest competitor’s high speed drive system (see comparison table below). We are so confident in the IMM Quality Superlifts that we offer a lifetime warranty on the cycloidal drive. No other boat lift drive system has a lifetime warranty.

Take a look at our design and you’ll see why IMM Quality Boat Lifts are built for a lifetime. We take pride in our engineering and product design expertise along with our unique capability to thoroughly performance test our lifts before they leave our factory. So, when only the absolute best will do, the IMM Quality Superlift vertical boat lift system is the only choice.

# What to Consider When Buying a Boat

- [January 24, 2018](https://iqboatlifts.com/2018/01/24/)
- [General Interest](https://iqboatlifts.com/general-interest/)

You’ve decided it’s time.

Time to live out your dreams.

Time to sail the open seas.

Time to buy a boat.

If you’ve decided to buy a boat, you’re in good company. In 2016, there were [3.65 billion dollars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/184587/number-of-recreational-boats-in-the-us/) of recreational boat sales.

But how do you decide exactly which boat to buy?

If you’re thinking of buying a boat, then keep reading. This article covers useful questions to ask yourself when buying a boat.

## Why Are You Buying a Boat?

From fishing boats to speed boats to houseboats. There are many different types of vessels to choose from when buying a boat.

What kind of activities do you want to do? Is it for deepsea fishing, or to take a relaxing cruise on a Sunday afternoon?

Maybe it’s the adrenaline rush you get from a speedboat that you’re looking for.

Ever consider living on a boat? Maybe do a little [island hopping](https://www.yachtingmagazine.com/island-hopping-made-easy)? Yes, there are even boats for that.

Make a list of all the things you want to do, and don’t hold back – there’s a boat for everything you could possibly dream of doing.

## Who Is The Boat For?

Next, decide who you will be inviting on this boat. Maybe you want a smaller two-man fishing boat for just you and your significant other.

Or maybe you are buying a boat to take a group of your best friends out for a social gathering on a 22-foot speedboat.

How many people you plan on having on your boat will help you determine what size of boat you should buy.

## When Will Your Boat Be Used?

Of course, we know you’ll be using the boat on beautiful, sunny days, but what about the days that you aren’t able to be on the water. Where will you keep it?

This is important to think about because there is a lot that goes into the storage and [winterization of a boat](https://iqboatlifts.com/5-important-tips-winterizing-boat/).

Do you have a place to store your boat during the offseason? How will you get it there?

Is your boat going to be kept at a vacation home? If so, you will need to consider if you need a [custom dock and gangway](https://iqboatlifts.com/floating-docks-and-gangways/).

## How Will You Purchase Your Boat?

Buying a boat is a big decision. It can also be an expensive decision.

There are different boats for every kind of budget. Boat prices can range anywhere from $10,000 up to $70,000 and beyond.

Do some research on different brands. Certain brands will be more expensive, while lesser known brands may be good enough, but more affordable.

Also, consider buying a used boat, or sharing the boat with other people you trust to keep the costs low.

## Time To Set Sail

The great thing about boating is it is completely custom and individualized to whatever adventure you are dreaming of.

Have questions or concerns regarding docking and boat lifts? Relax, [we’re here to help](https://iqboatlifts.com/contact/) in any way we can.

So get out there already! Get the boat you’ve been eyeing, invite your friends along.

# Marine Railway Boat Lifts Track System

The Marine Railway Boat Lifts are ideal for beach access or other gradual slope conditions where there are no deep water docks or seawalls. This unique type of lift is often used to pull boats or seaplanes onto dry land, into boat houses or inside garages. Often referred to as a “boat railroad” our system consists of type 6061-T6 aluminum rails on which a low profile carriage with vinyl covered aluminum bunks carries your boat and is powered by an electric push-pull drive. These systems are truly unique, so don’t hesitate to contact our custom design team to build a **Marine Railway** system that accommodates your boat lifting needs. Take a look at our design and see why **IQ** boat lifts are **Built for a Lifetime**.

IMM Quality Boat Lifts has a long tradition of engineering excellence. Our company makes use of this expertise to custom design boat lift solutions that perfectly fit your property. If you have been working with another boat lift company and you have gotten the feeling that they want to sell you a “one size fits all” solution, please give us a ring and talk to our engineering design team. We will make sure that you get a custom lift design that best suits your needs. With an IMM Quality boat lift, you can rest assured that you are getting the best-engineered boat lift on the market.

Sometimes, putting a lift into a boathouse can be rather difficult. Many of our competitor’s designs require the lift to be made a permanent part of the boathouse structure. Their boat lift top beams are made with risers that support the boathouse roof structural framing. Therefore, to replace the lift, you must literally take the roof off the boathouse. Or what if the boathouse was made before you were able to install a boat lift? Again, you would have to remove the roof before installing these kinds of lifts. We have always felt that this was a poor engineering solution. The engineers at IMM Quality Boat Lifts have developed solutions for boathouses that will give you many options to choose from. Why let another company force you to tear your boathouse roof off when IMM Quality can provide you a boat lift for your existing boathouse that is safe, durable and easy to use.

![boathouse lift from the side](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/boathouse-lift-solutions-side-view.jpg)

Our customer on Flathead Lake in Bigfork, Montana wanted to install a boat lift into a beautiful boathouse that he was building. This boathouse had some unusual design features. None of the piles went above the level of the dock’s decking. The boathouse was framed with large timber beams that were secured to the dock framing. The structural beams that run parallel with the slip have decking directly below them. This prevents hanging the boatlift from beneath these structural beams because the decking would be in the way of the cables and cradles.

![structural solutions for boathouse lift](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/boathouse-lift-structural-solutions.jpg)

![structural beams on boathouse lift](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/boathouse-lift-structural-beams-solutions-.jpg)

Our first suggestion was to hang the boatlift from the structural beams that run across the slip. Due to the location of the cross-members and the center of gravity of the boat, this choice would have required the boat to be located “off-center” within the boathouse. The customer did not like the look of this solution. Therefore, we suggested using side-mount brackets with standard top beams. These brackets allow the installation of the top beams parallel with the slip, but move the cable drop away from the decking, out over the water.

![side mount bracket on boathouse lift](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/boathouse-lift-side-mount-bracket.jpg)

Here is a side mount bracket.

Here is the engineered drawing of a side mount bracket.

![boathouse lift side mount brackets in use](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/boathouse-lift-side-mount-bracket-allowing-installation-of-starndard-top-beams.jpg)

And here is a picture showing how the side mount brackets allow the installation of standard top beams to the side of structural beams.

Once the customer was happy with how the boat lift would be mounted to the boathouse structure, our design team made sure that everything else made sense. The customer provided the dimensions of the dock and boathouse. He provided the type of boat and mentioned that he might like to upgrade to a bigger boat in the future. From this information, our engineers created a slip layout and custom-designed the top beam’s length, capacity and winder position to accommodate the largest size boat that could conceivably fit within the customer’s boathouse. These custom modifications resulted in the boat lift top beams being cantilevered with a cable drop forward of the side mount brackets. This will give the customer some room to grow.

All that was left was to install the lift, get a boat on it, and enjoy the time on Flathead Lake! Great job by all involved.

# Boat House Lifts

We can retrofit your existing **boathouse** using custom welded side mounting brackets. Boathouse lifts hanger bearings are the most common and effective way to mount a boat house lift inside a new or existing structure. The bearings are fastened to the hanger assembly, which then slides over the stringer bands of the **boathouse**. Once in place, the brackets are fastened to the bands using stainless steel bolts and require no drilling of the bands.

## **Design Your Dream Floating Boat House: Custom-Built to Your Specifications**

Floating boat houses have become increasingly popular among boating enthusiasts in recent years. These unique structures offer the perfect solution for those who want to keep their boat close at hand while enjoying the comforts of a waterfront home. The construction of a floating boat house involves several key elements, including the use of buoyant materials, a sturdy foundation, and a well-designed structure that can withstand the elements.

One of the main advantages of a floating boat house is its ability to rise and fall with the tide. This makes it an ideal choice for those who live in areas with changing water levels. The buoyancy of the materials used in the construction of the boat house allows it to remain stable and secure even during high tides or rough weather conditions.

When it comes to the construction of a floating boat house, it’s important to work with experienced professionals who understand the unique challenges involved.

## Why buy a boat lift?

While no one can deny the fact that boat lifts offer waterfront homeowners numerous conveniences, “protecting my investment” remains the number one reason boaters invest in these home improvements.  After all, keeping your most prized possession above tidal fluctuations and well out of harms reach from wind, waves, marine growth, and corrosion from harsh saltwater is critical to the longevity of our vessels.

For waterfront homeowners, it is obvious that storing your boat on a lift offers a huge convenience factor.  For starters, you can forget about fighting the crowds at the launch ramp as well as the numerous headaches that go along with maintaining a trailer.  While tying up is easy, lifting your boat high and dry when not in use is even better!  Not only does the convenience of a boat lift improve your overall boating experience, boat lifts increase the value of your home and help maintain the value of your boat.  Furthermore, boat lifts make it easy to inspect your vessel with great detail; whether it’s for a safety check, routine maintenance or thorough cleaning.  Boat lifts allow you to reach all sides of the hull and visually inspect thru-hull fittings, transducers, trim-tabs and props.  Boat lifts make routine maintenance and docking a breeze.

While purchasing a boat lift may sometimes seem like a hefty investment, in reality, they actually pay for themselves over time.  Go ahead and calculate what it costs to haul-out your boat annually to apply expensive anti-fouling coatings, or the routine maintenance required to keep your trailer functional.  It is an industry fact that applying bottom paint automatically reduces the resale value of your boat by as much as 10-percent.  The bottom line is that boat lifts are relatively maintenance free and make your boating and fishing experiences much more convenient and enjoyable.

**How to select a boat lift?**

Much like the rest of the marine industry, the last decade has seen significant innovation in the boat lift market with more yet to come.  Options now exist to suit nearly every dock configuration, tidal range and type of craft.  While there are a wide range of manufacturers and styles available, if you do your homework you will certainly find the proper boat lift for your particular application.  Manufacturers usually categorize their products by weight capacity.  Other important considerations include the depth of water at the dock, length of your vessel, beam length, type of hull (deep-V/catamaran) and propulsion (inboard/outboard).  It is also important to remember that the dry weight listed for your boat is not your vessel’s total weight.  You must compensate for fuel, water, tackle and gear.  Vessels powered with outboard engines do not generally include the engine(s) weight in the overall displacement, so that must also be added in.

When you begin to investigate your boat lift options, the plethora of choices will likely overwhelm you.  The boat lift choices can be distilled down to a few basic types that you should consider; standard four pile beamed cradle lifts, elevator lifts and boathouse lifts.

The four pile beamed cradle boat lift is currently the most efficient design for a cable drawn lift.  This type of lift was developed a couple of decades ago, and has become the industry standard.  It can be recognized by its parallel upper beams that each contain a motor driven shaft through their length on which four cables are wound.  The cables are connected to the four corners of the boat cradle, which is raised or lowered by clockwise or counter clockwise rotation of the shaft.  Four post lifts out-sell all other lifts combined due to the fact they are less expensive and are easier to maintain and install.  These lifts can be deigned to work with any sized vessel.   The “top beams” of these lifts can be set in a “low-profile” configuration, which allows you to use a covered top beam as a boarding platform for easy access to your boat.

Elevator style lifts are another popular option and they are ideal for use on restricted waterfronts where outboard pilings are not allowed, such as on narrow canals, or where the driving of pilings is difficult due to hard bottom conditions.  Elevator lifts can be mounted on seawalls or pilings and in a vertical or inclined position.  Elevator lifts are available with capacities up to 30,000 lbs. and custom designs can accommodate larger vessels if the strength of the underlying dock / seawall structure is adequate.  The only drawback to an elevator lift is a higher price tag than four post lifts.

[![Elevator Lift](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/marine-boatlifts-4-1.jpg)](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/marine-boatlifts-4-1.jpg) Elevator Lift

For homeowners fortunate enough to have a boathouse, adding a boat lift is a fantastic idea.  Traditionally, boathouse lifts were custom designed for each application where the top beams of a standard boat lift used special riser brackets that supported the boathouse rafters and roofing structure.  If you are considering building a boathouse with this style of boat lift installation, it is important you contact your intended boat lift dealer first to ensure a seamless installation.  As you can imagine, maintenance and repairs to your boat lift could be problematic with a riser bracket style of boathouse installation.  Even worse, if you decided to replace your boat lift, you would have to remove the roof of your boathouse to do so.  That is why the invention of hanger brackets has greatly improved the industry.  The hanger bracket assembly slides over the structural stringer bands of the boathouse.  Once in place, the hanger brackets are fastened to the structural stringer bands using stainless steel bolts that require no drilling of the bands.  The boat lift components hang from the bracket assembly with this style and can be easily maintained, repaired or replaced.  This makes hanger brackets the most effective way to mount a lift inside a new or existing boathouse.

## Drive Types

Your next consideration, should be the drive system.  The venerable flat plate was introduced over 40 years ago.  This economical option has the slowest operational speed, it is very noisy, messy and is hampered by its belt drive.  The belt drive requires frequent maintenance and is prone to slippage and breakage.  The chain drive has largely replaced the obsolete flat plate drive.  The chain drive is an economical choice with good operational speed and high shock load durability.  The chain drive does require annual maintenance.  There are many types of gear drives available, but the most common use dual worm gears.  These gear drives are fast, do not require any maintenance, and now are more durable than the flat plate.  The downside is that they are considerably more expensive than flat plate or chain drives.  Another choice is hydraulic drives.  These drives are very fast, but they have been found to be extremely susceptible to saltwater corrosion, prone to hydraulic leaks, are complicated to maintain and they are extremely expensive (generally double the price of a gear driven lift of the same capacity).

[![flat plate](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/flat-plate-2-179x300.jpg)](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/flat-plate-2.jpg)[![Alumavator Powerhead](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Alumavator-Powerhead-300x225.png)](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Alumavator-Powerhead.png)[![Platinum Powerhead](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Platinum-Powerhead-300x228.png)](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Platinum-Powerhead.png)

                    Flat Plate                                   Chain Drive                                           Direct Gear Drive

The previous styles of drives all rely upon extremely inefficient gearing (or hydraulic pressure) so that they can save money by not having a brake on the lift.  Kind of scary, but it works.  The final type of drive, the cycloidal drive, is different from the rest because it is extremely efficient (greater than 95% for cycloidal drives compared to approximately 35% for the others).  The high efficiency results in very fast lift speeds, even faster than hydraulics, but it requires the use of fail-safe brakes, which adds to the cost of the lift.  Cycloidal drives are also gearless, so they don’t have any gears to grind together, wear down, lose teeth and lock up.  Consequently, cycloidal drives have legendary durability and come with a lifetime guarantee.  Cycloidal drives are also the most powerful drives in the industry.  One manufacturer claims their gear drives are the most powerful in the industry with 8,000 in. / lbs. of torque, but cycloidal drives with 34,000 in. / lbs. of torque are routinely used on boat lifts and cycloidal drives with up to 521,000 in. / lbs. of torque are available to use on mega yacht lifts.  Although they are less expensive than hydraulic drives, the major drawback to cycloidal drive systems is that they are more expensive than the other drive systems.  However, if only the absolute best will do, and you want the fastest, most powerful and durable drive system, the cycloidal drive is the only choice.

[![Cycloidal Drive](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Superlift-powerhead-300x265.png)](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Superlift-powerhead.png) Cycloidal Drive

Finally, you need to consider the other components on the lift to see if they will make your boat lift easier and more convenient to use.  Does the lift use pulley and drive shaft bearings that require lubrication?  Do you really want to climb out onto your cradle and top beams, find the zirk fittings and grease up your drive shaft and pulley bearings every 3 months, or would you rather have a lift with maintenance-free self-lubricating bearings?  Would you rather have a lift that uses cables with fixed ends that can’t be adjusted once installed and must be cut off and repaired during cable replacement?  Or would you prefer a lift with wedge locks that allow for easy adjustment of cable length to level the cradle, adjust the pitch of the boat and make cable replacement easier?  Do you want a lift designed with cable keepers or cable rollers to ensure proper cable winding and extend cable life?  Do you want your top beams made with stepped channel which provides structural support for the drive bearing blocks and eliminates shear loads on the weld?  Or would you prefer your top beams be made from standard C channel with the entire load held up by the weld?  Do you want wood bunks or aluminum bunks?  Does the manufacturer use UV resistant non-marring white vinyl that requires no top-side rivets or do their bunks use black plastic with top-side rivets that can mar and scratch your hull?  Is the lift made from aluminum or galvanized steel?  Due to recent changes in EPA guidelines, the galvanizing compound now scratches off easily and galvanized steel lifts will quickly corrode.  Aluminum will not corrode, but it is more expensive than steel.

## **Conclusion**

They only account for a small percentage of your overall boating expenses, yet they greatly reduce maintenance while simultaneously increasing safety and the value of your property.

# The Rose Key Projects

- [January 22, 2021](https://iqboatlifts.com/2021/01/22/)
- [Specialty Projects](https://iqboatlifts.com/specialty-projects/)

Rose Key lies at the center of a privately held archipelago in Monroe County, Florida, located a few miles north of the Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo. The island chain and surrounding waters boast a storied past, from the discovery of Biscayne Bay by Ponce de Leon to the CIA using Rose Key as a safe house and training area. More recently, the popular 1980s TV show, _Miami Vice,_ used Rose Key as a film location. Rose Key was named in honor of Rose Zumpano, a long-time South Florida philanthropist, who loved to share with others the wonders of the Florida Keys.

![The Rose Key Skyway invites guest with a custom built aluminum archway.](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RoseKeySkyway-Arch-300x168.jpg)

IMM Quality Boat Lifts has been fortunate enough to be involved with many of the island’s marine construction projects. Our very first project involved some of the island’s unique history. The CIA built a [marine railway](https://iqboatlifts.com/marine-railway-lifts/) to launch watercraft into the island’s southern channel and over the years, it had become inoperable. We repaired the concrete structure, supplemented the steel rails with aluminum rails, upgraded the machinery and customized the shuttle to accommodate the Rose Key’s Carolina skiff. These projects were standard fare for a boat lift manufacturer of our size and caliber, but the following projects will highlight the design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities no other boat lift company possesses.

When you have an amazing client like the Zumpano family, you often get asked to take on projects that are outside your normal product line. The family wanted to repair a skyway to provide access from the compound’s center to the southeast tip of their barrier island. Their Rose Key Skyway would cross the horseshoe-shaped canal system that encircles the main island. They wanted a [retractable span](https://iqboatlifts.com/custom-retractable-bridge-on-the-florida-keys/) to cross the canal that would be installed as a seamless part of the Rose Key Skyway.

So, IMM Quality Boat Lifts built them a Vlotburg span and decked it to match the walkway. Below you can see the Vlotburg under construction and a video showing how easy the span is to retract by hand.

![Retractable Bridge Crossing Canal](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/retractable-bridge-in-the-keys-1024x768.jpg)

![YouTube video player](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mXM1WbAlmIw/hqdefault.jpg)

The Rose Key Skyway was the project that tested our manufacturing capacity. We needed to manufacture thousands of feet of aluminum handrailing. Some of the handrailing was manufactured on an angle to deal with changes in elevation. Below, you can see the Rose Key Skyway under construction, some of the engineered sections, the completed Skyway, and finally, a drone video that highlights the magnitude and scope of the Rose Key Skyway aluminum handrail project.

![YouTube video player](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wxkSu2CLhao/hqdefault.jpg)

The Rose Key Skyway was designed to terminate with a gazebo and terminal dock. The family needed railing around the dock, along with some gates. We designed some aluminum columns with a stainless-steel cable railing system to accomplish this project. Below are some photos of an engineered rendering of the gazebo, the gates, and the gazebo under construction.

![Final Product Of Rose Key Gazebo Project](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Final-Product-of-Rose-Key-Projects-1024x814.jpg)

Now, after many months, the work on the Rose Key Skyway is complete! IMM Boat Lifts successfully refurbished the skyway from the center of the Rose Key compound to the dock at the property’s perimeter.

# Building Better Top Beams

- [August 19, 2022](https://iqboatlifts.com/2022/08/19/)
- [Boat Lifts](https://iqboatlifts.com/boat-lifts/), [Specialty Projects](https://iqboatlifts.com/specialty-projects/)

At [IMM Quality Boat Lifts](https://iqboatlifts.com/), our skilled engineers have developed a way of building better top beams for our boat lifts.

The original designs for boat lift top beams put the drive pipe and bearing blocks on top of the structure. This simple design was easy to manufacture with “off-the-shelf” parts. However, there was a risk that fingers and clothing could easily get caught in the exposed drive pipe and cable during lift operation. After a series of accidents, many municipalities have banned this design due to safety concerns.

![IMM Quality boat lift that shows exposed drive pipe secured to top of the structure](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/02-IMM-Quality-boat-lift-that-shows-exposed-drive-pipe-secured-to-top-of-the-structure.jpg)This boat lift shows exposed drive pipe secured to top of the structure.

To address this safety problem, most manufacturers have now put the drive pipe inside the top beam structure. The top beams of typical boat lifts are made from C-channel and flat-wall bearing blocks. The bearing blocks are welded to the side of the C-channel and support the full weight of the boat.

![Inferior c channel top beam design](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/03-Inferior-C-channel-top-beam-design.jpg)An inferior C-channel top beam design

But what happens if there is a bad weld that breaks? There is no structure to support the weight, and your boat crashes into the water. The C-channel top beams are obviously not an ideal design, but they are the cheapest and easiest way to get the job done. But do you really want the safety of your boat relying upon this flawed design?

![IMM Quality: Building Better Top Beams](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fex2-kysKGI/hqdefault.jpg)

IMM Quality Boat Lift’s superior manufacturing capabilities allow our engineers the flexibility to make better designs because our machines can make any metal part. We are not limited to “off-the-shelf” parts. Instead, we make all of our parts in-house using our extensive array of CNC machines. Furthermore, we are willing to take our designs directly to the aluminum foundries and mills, where we have paid to have them make custom foundry dies. The aluminum mills use these dies to make custom aluminum extrusions that we machine into some of the parts for our boat lifts.

![IMM Quality custom extrusion for the boat lift stepped wall bearing blocks](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04-IMM-Quality-custom-extrusion-for-the-boat-lift-stepped-wall-bearing-blocks.jpg)Featuring a custom extrusion for the “stepped” wall bearing blocks

IMM Quality Boat Lifts has a much better solution for boat lift top beams. Our engineers designed a “stepped” channel and paired it with a “stepped”-wall bearing block. The “stepped” walls improve boat lift top beams in several ways:

![Diagram that shows positioning of stepped bearing block](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/05-Diagram-that-shows-positioning-of-stepped-bearing-block.jpg)

First, the step increases the strength and rigidity of the channel. Think about holding a piece of paper by its edge. The paper does not stand out, but flops over because the thin paper is not rigid enough to support the weight. Now make a “Z” fold down the length of the paper to make a step. The paper will now easily stand out its full length when you hold it by the edge. These same physical principles apply to the top beam channel when we add the step to it, and we now have a channel with improved strength and rigidity.

![Diagram that shows hand holding flat paper and stepped paper](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/06-Diagram-that-show-hand-holding-flat-paper-and-stepped-paper.jpg)Adding a step to a flat material increases its strength and rigidity.

Secondly, the steps greatly simplify the alignment of the bearing blocks within the top beam channel. By having the steps of the bearing block and top beam channel fit perfectly together like two pieces of a puzzle, we have eliminated the human error that can occur when the welder measures the vertical position of each bearing block. This feature makes sure that the bearing blocks are always perfectly aligned and that you won’t have to try to force your drive pipe through bearing blocks that are out of position.

![Stepped channel top beam showing stepped wall bearing blocks welded into perfect alignment by imm quality boat lifts](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/07-Stepped-channel-top-beam-showing-stepped-wall-bearing-blocks-welded-into-perfect-alignment-by-IMM-Quality-Boat-LIfts.jpg)

Most important of all, the step provides physical support to the bearing block. The step in the channel creates a ledge upon which the shelf of the “stepped”-wall bearing block sits. Although it took more effort to design these patented custom extrusions, and although they cost more than an “off-the-shelf” solution, the effort is well worth it because nothing is more important than your safety. Even if a weld were to fail in the IMM-designed top beam, there is still aluminum structure to support the weight of your boat. Sometimes accidents happen, and when they do, you will be glad to have a boat lift engineered with redundant back-up safety features.

Exceptionally engineered and thoroughly tested, IMM Quality Boat Lifts are _**Built for a Lifetime**_.

Have you ever wondered, “How does an elevator lift work?” An elevator boat lift functions much like other standard boat lift systems, in that it removes and securely stores your boat above the water. At the same time, an elevator system has a uniquely specialized design.

In a recent blog article, IMM Quality Boat Lifts examined the basic parts and function of a boat lift, explaining how it works and why many boat owners view this as a wise investment. Check out [our informative piece](https://iqboatlifts.com/what-is-a-boat-lift-your-questions-answered) about standard features (cable, pulleys, nylatron wheels, auto stop, remote control etc.) on lift systems to learn more.

## Why Buy an Elevator Boat Lift?

Are you wondering, “Why buy an elevator boat lift?” First, be sure to analyze your needs. You need to know the make and model of your watercraft or yacht as well as the water conditions (water depth, tidal fluctuation, bottom conditions, etc.) at your installation location. It pays to take the time to explore your options in consultation with a knowledgeable marine contractor. While it may sound like a cliché, not all lifts are created equal. Each type serves its unique purpose.

### **Make Boating Easier with an Elevator Boat Lift**

Elevator lifts are a good option for locations in which the installation of pilings is difficult or prohibited.  This may be due to the limited water rights of the property, crowded waterways, and canals, or because hard bottom conditions make the driving of pilings prohibitively expensive. Elevator boat lifts don’t require pilings for structural support and can accommodate larger vessels up to 40,000 lbs if the dock/seawall structure is strong enough. Elevator lifts provide convenience, protect boats, and add value to waterfront property.

### **Safety and Convenience with Elevator Boat Lifts**

Thinking of installing an elevator boat lift at your waterfront property? [Investing in an elevator lift](https://iqboatlifts.com/elevator-lifts/) offers you a number of advantages. This system provides safe and easy access to the water, allowing you to launch and dock your vessel with a single push of a button. Even in narrow canals, elevator lifts can safely maneuver your boat in and out of the water. With this type of system, you’ll enjoy a perfect fit for any vessel size – plus all the convenience and safety of using elevator technology.

## **How Do Elevator Boat Lifts Differ?**

### **Our Different Elevator**

As you can see, the system minimizes the amount of support structure that is visible above the deck height. Many homeowners prefer this less obtrusive style of boat lift because it provides a more open view of their waterfront property.

### **Rails**

An elevator system differs from a standard one in a few key ways. Instead of a top beam supported by pilings, it uses rails (I-beam tracks) supported by your dock or seawall. These rails may be mounted vertically or at an angle, depending on your needs. One end of the rail is driven into the seabed while the other is attached to the dock with mounting brackets and track bracing. You should consult a knowledgeable marine contractor to confirm that your dock structure is capable of supporting the load created by the elevator system and to determine the best angle of installation and the required length of the rails.

### **Powerheads**

Elevator lifts have two powerheads that attach to the top of each rail. The powerheads consist of the drive system (gearing and motor) under a protective cover that is coupled to a grooved aluminum cable winder. These powerheads pull the carriage up and lower the carriage down the rails using stainless steel cables. Put simply, it is like a train (carriage) riding on rails.

### ![Elevator lifts Powerheads](https://iqboatlifts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/elevator-superlift-1_page-0001.jpg)**Powerhead Drive Systems**

![Elevator Superlift Boat Lift by IMM Quality Boat Lifts](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f7Tqh6y31hE/hqdefault.jpg)

### **Carriage Construction**

Elevator lifts use a carriage constructed of two “L” shaped arms connected by two aluminum bunks and cross bracing. The carriage has wheels that ride along the top surface of the I-beam track as well as the underside of the same I-beam flange.



IMM Quality Boat Lifts gussets our elevator boat lift “L” shaped arms with one-inch thick billet aluminum plates. Why are our gusset plates so much thicker than the competition’s? Because our gusset plates have CNC-machined channels cut into them that secure the upper and lower flanges of the I-beams that form the “L” shaped arms of the carriage.

Fitted together in this way, the gusset plate reinforces the I-beam joint and provides mechanical support, so that the lift is not relying solely on the strength of welded construction. Furthermore, this innovative approach guarantees the correct alignment of the elevator carriage parts in all three dimensions, fixing the proper angles for the arms and eliminating excess stress on the joint. No more cock-eyed, out-of-square elevator carriages.

## Frequently Asked Question (FAQs) on Elevator Boat Lift

What is an elevator boat lift and how does it work?

An elevator boat lift functions by lifting and securely storing your boat above the water, similar to other boat lift systems. However, it uses a specialized design with rails supported by your dock or seawall, allowing the boat to be raised and lowered with a carriage system that moves along these rails.

Why should I consider buying an elevator boat lift?

Elevator boat lifts are ideal for locations where installing pilings is difficult or prohibited due to factors like water rights, crowded waterways, or hard bottom conditions. They do not require pilings for structural support and can handle larger vessels, making them a versatile option for different marine environments.

What are the key features of an elevator boat lift?

Key features of elevator boat lifts typically include cable systems, pulleys, nylatron wheels, auto stop capabilities, and remote control operation. These components work together to provide a smooth and efficient lift process, enhancing convenience and safety for boat owners.

How do elevator boat lifts differ from standard boat lifts?

Unlike standard lifts that often rely on a top beam supported by pilings, elevator lifts use rails (I-beam tracks) that can be mounted vertically or at an angle, directly supported by the dock or seawall. This setup minimizes the visible support structure, offering a less obtrusive appearance and preserving the view of waterfront properties.

What should I consider when installing an elevator boat lift?

It is important to know the specifications of your boat and the conditions at your installation site, such as water depth and tidal fluctuations. Consulting with a knowledgeable marine contractor is essential to ensure your dock can support the load of the lift and to determine the best installation approach for your specific needs.
