- [Geotargeting](https://docs.joinmassive.com/isp-proxies/geotargeting.md): You can tune the request by providing geo parameters like an [ISO ZIP code, subdivision, and country code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search), and by [city](https://www.geonames.org/).
- [Introduction](https://docs.joinmassive.com/isp-proxies/introduction.md): Massive ISP proxy networks use AT&T infrastructure to provide high-speed, rotating proxies across the US. With 10 Gbps speeds and automatic rotation capabilities, our proxies are perfect for your data collection needs.
- [.NET (in C#)](https://docs.joinmassive.com/isp-proxies/samples/.net.md): .NET integrations should connect to the [Massive Network’s HTTP port](/isp-proxies/authentication#HTTP) `4080` because [.NET doesn’t broadly support HTTPS proxies yet](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/87638):
- [Puppeteer](https://docs.joinmassive.com/isp-proxies/samples/puppeteer.md): Integrate the Massive Network into your Puppeteer workflows by setting the `--proxy-server` launch flag then calling a page object’s `authenticate` method:
- [(Vanilla) Python](https://docs.joinmassive.com/isp-proxies/samples/python.md): To connect to the Massive Network from Python, include your encoded credentials in the proxy address (this usage doesn’t risk leaking your API token to a shared history file per the caveat for Curl):
