# API Authentication
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/api-guides/api-authentication



fabric APIs use [System Apps](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/creating-system-app), which employ [OpenID Connect's Client Credential Flow](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) for API authentication.

## System App Authentication

System App authentication is the process by which a system application verifies its identity and obtains authorization to access specific APIs or services. System Applications, also called System Apps, are specialized software applications designed to perform automated tasks and system-level functions. System Apps don't authenticate end-users and aren't associated with user pools, hence these API applications aren't intended for direct use by shoppers for storefront authentication. System Apps only facilitates secure and efficient system-level interactions with fabric APIs. System Apps are commonly deployed in enterprise contexts, including systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Order Management Systems (OMS), Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and Storefronts.

A System App uses OpenID Connect to obtain an access token referred to as a system token:

1. The System App possesses a unique identifier called a [client ID](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/getting-system-app-credentials) and a confidential [client secret](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/getting-system-app-credentials).
2. To start authentication, the system app sends a request to an authorization server, providing its client ID and client secret.
3. If the provided client ID and client secret are valid, the authorization server issues an access token referred to as a system token to the System App.\
   This system token serves as the key for the system app to make authorized requests to APIs or services, representing the system during interactions. System Apps use this token for all subsequent fabric API calls.

# Example
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/api-guides/example



### Make your first API request

This section provides you the instructions to use the [Create Attribute](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attributes/create-attribute) endpoint. With this endpoint, you can create attributes that can be assigned to a product or category.

#### Prerequisites:

* Generate the access token by following the instructions in the [Getting Started with fabric APIs](/v3/getting-started/api-guides/getting-started-with-fabric-apis).
* Get the `x-fabric-tenant-id` by following the instructions in the [Getting the Account ID](/v3/platform/settings/account-details/getting-the-account-id).

#### Procedure

1. Open your preferred API testing tool or command-line interface.
2. To run the following API call, set the following headers in the request with the corresponding values and add the payload as in the example:
   * `x-fabric-tenant-id`: Replace `<Tenant-Id>` with your fabric tenant ID.
   * `Authorization`: Replace `<Generated-access-token>` with the access token obtained from the previous steps.
   * `Content-Type`: Set this header to `application/json`.

```bash
   curl --location 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-attributes' \  
   --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: <Tenant-Id>' \  
   --header 'Authorization: <Generated-access-token>' \  
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \  
   --data '{  
      "name": "20063",  
      "localizedProperties": {  
         "en-US": {  
               "name": "demo_en_us_attribute"  
         }  
      },  
      "description": "Demo_attribute",  
      "type": "TEXT",  
      "target": "PRODUCT",  
      "isLocalizable": false,  
      "validation": {  
         "isMandatory": false,  
         "subType": "SMALL_TEXT",  
         "customValidationFormula": ""  
      }  
   }'  
```

Note that this payload is an example. You can edit it as required.
3\. Send a POST request to the `https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-attributes` endpoint.\
A response with the status code 200 is returned with the following information:

```bash
{  
   "id": "",  
   "name": "",  
   "description": "",  
   "isLocalizable": ,  
   "target": "",  
   "type": "",  
   "validation": {  
      "isMandatory": ,  
      "subType": "",  
      "customValidationFormula": "",

# Getting Started with fabric APIs
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/api-guides/getting-started-with-fabric-apis



This topic will provide instructions to start using fabric’s APIs to build unique and flexible shopping experiences for your customers. fabric recommends [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) as the API client.

### API URL

The base URL, which is also called `fabric-base-url`, `https://api.fabric.inc/v3/{product}` is the standard URL to which the requests are sent for all fabric APIs.

### Prerequisites

Before you can start using fabric’s APIs:

* **Get your trial account:** Reach out for a trial account with fabric and to get your environment and credentials set up for you. This will help you set up your Copilot account.
* **Access to your Copilot Account:** Ensure you have the credentials to access your Copilot account; if you don't have an account, reach out. Once you have an account, you can add other team members for effective collaboration.
* [Get the API collection that you want to use](/v3/getting-started/api-guides/api-references): Ensure you have access to the API collection for the product you want to try.
* Ensure that a [system app is created](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/creating-system-app) for your account. You must have admin rights to create a system app in Copilot.
* Download the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) client.

### Procedure

1. **Log in** to your Copilot account.
2. In the left menu, click **Settings > Developer Tools**.
3. Click **API Apps**.
   * The API Apps page is displayed. This page provides a list of apps created in your account. The **app type** field specifies whether the application is a user app or system app.
4. Click the name of a system app that's already created for your account.\
   The details of the system app are displayed.
5. Make a note of the following settings:
   * **Authorization URL:** A unique URL of each fabric merchant, common across all system apps defined for a single merchant.
   * **Client ID:** Public identifier of an app.
   * **Client Secret:** The Secret known only to your application and the authorization server used to authenticate the app.\
     These values are required for authentication of your system app and to start using the APIs. For more information about these settings, see the [API Apps](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/api-apps) page.
6. In the following code sample for the /token endpoint, replace the `{{authURL}}`, `{{clientId}}`, and `{{clientSecret}}` with the corresponding values from step 5:

```shell
curl --location --request POST '{{authURL}}/v1/token'  
--header 'accept: application/json'  
--header 'cache-control: no-cache'  
--header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'  
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'  
--data-urlencode 'scope=s2s'  
--data-urlencode 'client_id={{clientId}}'  
--data-urlencode 'client_secret={{clientSecret}}'  
```

1. Log in to the Postman client.

2. To generate an access token, do the following steps:

   1. In the left menu, click **Import**.
   2. Import the code sample from Step 6.
   3. Run the `/token` endpoint.

   ```js
   {  
         "token_type": "Bearer",  
         "expires_in": 600,  
         "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiIt...",  
         "scope": "s2s"  
   }  
   ```

3. Make a note of the access token.\
   The access token is used to authenticate all your API requests. The token expires after 10 minutes. You must generate a new access token to continue using the API endpoints.

4. [Make your first API request](/v3/getting-started/api-guides/making-your-first-api-request).

## Identifiers in fabric APIs

This topic explains how fabric uses `sku`, `itemId`, `pricelineId`, and `inventoryId` as methods of identification with fabric APIs.
In general, fabric uses `sku` to specify a product because it's used across all domains. However, other identifiers are also used in certain API services.

<Note>fabric recommends avoiding `itemId` in V3 API implementations. However, `itemId` is still supported and used in V2.</Note>

The following table provides a list of all identifiers used across different services and the corresponding services:

| **Identifier** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sku`          | This identifier is used across all services, such as [Product Catalog](#product-catalog), [Offers](#offers), [Carts](#carts), [Orders](#orders), and [Inventory](#inventory).                                                                                                                  |
| `itemId`       | This identifier is used in [Offers](#offers), [Carts](#carts), [Orders](#orders), and [Inventory](#inventory). The [Product Catalog](#product-catalog) service doesn't use `itemId`. In [Carts](#carts), a user-generated `itemId` is used, separate from the `itemId` used in other services. |
| `priceListId`  | This identifier is used in [Offers](#offers) and [Carts](#carts).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `inventoryId`  | This identifier is used only in [Inventory](#inventory).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Product catalog

### Stock keeping unit (SKU)

In Product Catalog, a `sku` is a unique identifier for a specific product. SKUs are created by the user when adding a product. SKUs are the preferred method for managing products. They allow you to monitor, publish, and unpublish products.

You can perform several key actions with SKUs to manage products and their lifecycles.

The following table shows examples of supported operations using `sku`:

| **Operations**                                                                                                                                      | **Descriptions**                                                                                             |

###

Similar to SKUs, the `itemId` is also used to identify products in Product Catalog.

However, unlike SKUs,`itemId` is automatically generated by the fabric system when a new product is created.

The following table shows examples of supported operations using `itemId`:

| **Operations**                                                                                                                     | **Descriptions**                                                                 |

## Offers

### Stock keeping unit (SKU)

fabric's Offers APIs enable you to manage prices and create various types of discounts and promotions using `sku`.

The following are some examples of operations in Offers that are supported using `sku`:

| **Operations**                                                                                                             | **Descriptions**                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Price list ID

Offers API creates a `priceListId` when generating a price list, which includes generic information such as currency.
The `priceListId` is used to identify entities that specify how the items should be priced.

The following are some examples of how `priceListId` is utilized:

| **Operations**                                                                                                                    | **Descriptions**                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Create price list](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/price-lists/create-price-list)                                                | When creating price list for an item, `priceListId` is automatically generated and is used to identify different price lists. |
| [Create promotion](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/promotions/create-promotion)                                                   | If the `priceList` is eligible, a promotion is created for the item.                                                          |
| [Retrieve SKUs in a price list](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/priced-products/get-product-and-price-details-by-product-item-id) | In a given price list, all associated `sku` and `productItemId` values are returned in the response body.                     |
| [Retrieve priced products](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/priced-products/get-priced-products)                                   | If `priceListId` is sent in the request body, all items belonging to the price list are returned in the response body.        |

## Carts

### Stock keeping unit (SKU)

The Carts API allows you to add, update, and remove items, and those items can be identified by `sku`, from the storefront cart.

When creating a checkout, the system uses the `cartId` to identify all items using `sku` in the specific cart.

While `sku` isn't used in the path parameter for Carts endpoints, it's used in the request body. The following shows examples of operations where you use `sku` in the request body and view it in the response body:

| **Operations**                                                                        | **Descriptions**                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Create a line item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items)        | Adds a line item to the cart using `sku`.                                           |
| [Update a line item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/update-items) | Updates a line item in the cart to a new item by referencing the `sku`.             |
| [Retrieve a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/get-cart)        | In the cart details, you can view the line items and their associated `sku` values. |

### Item ID

The Carts endpoint creates a cart-specific `itemId`, also referred to as `lineItemId`. You can use the `itemId` to add an item to the corresponding `cartId` and adjust prices.

The following are some examples of operations in Carts that are supported using `itemId`:

| **Operations**                                                                                                                          | **Descriptions**                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Add an item into the specified cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items)                                         | Manually enter the `itemId`, which can then be used in other cart endpoints. |
| [Update an item in the specified cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items)                                        | Update item details within a specific cart using `lineItemId`.               |
| [Adjust price of the item in the specified cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/item-adjustments/create-item-adjustments) | Adjust the prices of an item in the specified cart.                          |

### Price list ID

The Carts API uses `priceListId` to calculate prices and evaluate discounts for individual products and carts. This ensures accurate pricing when items are added to a cart.

The following are some examples of how `priceListId` is utilized:

| **Operations**                                                                                   | **Descriptions**                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Add an item into the specific cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items)   | When a line item is added to the cart, the respective `priceListId` is included to identify the cart's price. |
| [Update an item in the specified cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) | When a line item is updated, the price is also adjusted.                                                      |

## Orders

### Stock keeping unit (SKU)

When creating or modifying an order, you can add one or more `sku` by selecting a network and channel, a network and channel, which enables browsing for all the available `sku`.
Only `sku` with an "Available" stock status and availability greater than or equal to one can be added to an order.
You can select more than one `sku` at once and specify the quantity for each.
Orders display `sku` information, including `sku`, price per unit, quantity, and availability.

`sku` is used as unique identifier for items in an order. Order details typically show `sku`, quantity, and total cost for each item.

The following are some examples of when `sku` is used to verify that orders contain the correct items:

| **Operations**                                                                                                                                           | **Descriptions**                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **[Create a new order](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/orders/create-new-order)**                                                          | When creating a new order, the item’s `sku` and `itemId` are used to verify that the correct item is processed.                |
| **[Search for backorders or preorders](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/backorders-preorders/search-for-backorders-or-preorders-by-query)** | After searching for backorders or preorders, you can use the `sku` to verify that the correct items are included in the order. |
| **[Search for allocation](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/allocations/search-for-allocations-by-query)**                                   | One of the filter criteria for searching inventory allocation is `sku`.                                                        |
| **[Create a new shipment](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/shipments/create-new-shipment)**                                                 | To fulfill an order and ship it, the items that are set to ship can be identified by `sku`.                                    |

### Item ID

When creating or modifying an order, you can add one ore more `sku` by selecting a network and channel, and then browsing available `itemId`.
Only `itemId` with an "Available" stock status and availability greater than or equal to one can be added to an order.
You can select more than one `itemId` at once and specify the quantity for each.

## Inventory

### Stock keeping unit (SKU)

When you create inventory, the `sku` is stored as a native value.
During network setup, you can apply conditional rules to include specific SKUs and configure safety stock levels to maintain optimal inventory availability.
Inventory networks also aggregate `sku` quantities across various locations. Even if `sku` isn't directly referenced in some endpoints, they play a crucial role in the background.

The following are some examples of operations in Inventory that are supported using `sku`:

| **Operations**                                                                                                                                           | **Descriptions**                                                                                                                 |

# Making your first API request
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/api-guides/making-your-first-api-request



When making calls to fabric APIs, you must use the following HTTP headers to provide context.

* **`--header`**: This flag is used to include headers in the request. The most commonly used headers in fabric APIs are:
  * **`x-fabric-tenant-id`**: This is a custom header used by the API to identify the tenant making the request. You can [find the tenant-id](/v3/platform/settings/account-details/getting-the-account-id) in Copilot.
  * **`Content-Type: application/json`**: This tells the server that the data being sent in the request is in JSON format.
  * **`Authorization: Bearer`**: This is the authorization token used to authenticate the request. You must pass the access token generated from the system app.
  * **`x-fabric-channel-id`**: This is a custom header, used to identify the channel through which the request is being made. This is primarily used for a multichannel use case. Usually, the default value is 12 (US).

fabric API responses are in JSON format.

#### Prerequisites

Before you can start using fabric APIs:

* Generate the access token by following the instructions in the [Getting Started with fabric APIs](/v3/getting-started/api-guides/getting-started-with-fabric-apis) section.
* Get the x-fabric-tenant-id by following the instructions in the [Getting the Account ID](/v3/platform/settings/account-details/getting-the-account-id) section.

#### Procedure

The following steps use [Create attribute](/v3/api-reference/product-catalog/attributes/create-attribute) as an example:

1. Log in to Postman client.
2. In the left menu, click **Import**
   The import window will display.
3. In the import window, copy and paste the following code:

```bash
   curl --request POST \
   --url https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-attributes \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
   --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: <tenant-id>' \
   --data '{
      "name": "Category datetime example",
      "isLocalizable": false,
      "target": "CATEGORY",
      "type": "DATETIME",
      "validation": {
         "isMandatory": false,
         "isManualOverwrite": false,
         "formula": "",
         "dateFormat": "MM/DD/YYYY"
      }
   }'  
```

4. To populate the headers, click the **Headers** tab and do the following:
   * To enter **`Authorization: Bearer`**, replace **Bearer \<token>** with the access token you generated from [Getting Started with fabric APIs](/v3/api-reference/getting-started/getting-started-with-fabric-apis) section.
   * To enter **`x-fabric-channel-id`**, replace **\<tenant-id>** with the tenant-id you obtained from [Getting the Account ID](/v3/guides/settings/account-details/getting-the-account-id) section.
5. Click **Send**.

# Security and Compliance
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/api-guides/security-and-compliance

Learn how we protect customer data, user data, and the reliability of our commerce services and applications.

We use an SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team to manage, maintain, and operate our security policies and procedures. We also use secure engineering and quality assurance practices to ensure ongoing security compliance.

fabric’s core product is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure that supports security standards and compliance certifications which could help our customers satisfy compliance requirements for virtually every regulatory agency around the globe. Additionally, fabric holds following compliance certifications / attestations and self assessment questionnaires:

* SOC 2 Type I
* SOC 2 Type II
* PCI DSS (SAQ - A)

fabric doesn't process / store credit card information directly. Instead, third party payment gateways (PCI compliant) are used to handle payment transactions. We can supply certificates, insurance policies, and security playbooks on request.

## Access Control Management

All access to fabric infrastructure is based on RBAC and the principle of least privilege. We manage access control logging at the user level for console and CLI actions. This log allows us to trace code-level commits and offers traceable and auditable protocols for code-level commits, along with actions to manage code between environments. Additionally, all access to the fabric AWS environment is only provided through Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

fabric leverages industry recognized hashing, encryption and salting mechanisms to protect all credentials stored in the environment. To secure user credentials, TLS is used to encrypt the requests and responses throughout the login process and credential information is encrypted at rest using server side encryption. Credentials are verified by the comparison of a salted hash of the password using a high-computational effort hashing algorithm (such as bcrypt) against a persisted value and calls to the login API are rate limited to protect against brute force attacks. User account is disabled after 10 unsuccessful login attempts.

Logged in users are provided with a JSON Web Token that proves the user’s identity and contains claims that will be used to authorize subsequent requests. The token is signed with fabric’s private key as described in [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519), allowing the integrity of the token to be evaluated by receiving systems.

## Data and Asset Protection

fabric leverages security tools, processes and cloud native services to protect the infrastructure, including:

* DDOS protection
* WAF protection
* Bot configuration and IP whitelisting
* Performing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) through tools integrated into the CI/ CD pipeline
* Code reviews to protect against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and more
* EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tool for user workstations and cloud instances

The SRE team at fabric has a data loss recovery plan for all systems in place. In addition to this, we:

* Store all customer-related information on secure cloud accounts
* Only allow SRE personnel to grant access to cloud accounts and all digital data
* Deploy the Storefront with a dedicated managed database as a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
* Employ secure, multi-zonal replication and encryption of data
* Protect data transfer with SSE (Server-Side Encryption)
* Retain data only for a month after the end of the contract
* Accept a request from you to delete your data
* Only work with third parties who meet our security and insurance conditions

## Incident Response Management

We actively monitor all logs, reports, and alerts to detect threats. Our incident response team is available 24/7/365 on an on-call schedule for global coverage. In case of an incident, the SRE team recreates or verifies the suspected issue. Then, we bring the appropriate resources together to address the incident.

Our standard priority-based incident response SLA is provided below. Here, P1 refers to the highest priority and P4 the lowest.

* First email response within 30 minutes
* Follow up responses every hour until the issue is resolved
* SLA: as soon as possible
* Report issue by phone
* First email response within 30 minutes
* Second follow up response within 6 hours
* SLA: 2-3 business days
* Report issue by email only
* First email response within 30 minutes
* Second follow up response within business 2-3 days
* SLA: 5-7 business days
* Report issue by email only

This policy may be customized at your request as part of the MSA and onboarding process.

## Vulnerability Assessment

fabric’s continuous vulnerability management program consists of two pillars:

* Deep integration into fabric’s CI/CD Pipeline
* Scheduled vulnerability scans of deployed code

We create and run automated security unit tests on each code change before the deployment. To identify vulnerabilities, we also perform a security scan every four weeks. We rate vulnerabilities as critical, high, medium, and low. Critical and high vulnerabilities are acted upon within 3 to 7 days, medium within 14 days, and low within 30 days.

Periodic secure coding audits and external penetration tests follow the security scan. During the security review, a trained reviewer analyzes the code for potential security flaws. The analysis is based on standards of the OWASP Security Knowledge Framework.


# Using Developer Portal
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/api-guides/using-developer-portal



[The developer portal](https://developer.fabric.inc/) provides API definitions that include working code examples and the ability to make authenticated API requests directly within the documentation. This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to make API calls from the developer portal.

#### Prerequisites

* Install the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) client.
* Generate the access token by following the instructions in the [Getting Started with fabric APIs](/v3/getting-started/api-guides/getting-started-with-fabric-apis) section.
* Get the `x-fabric-tenant-id` by following the instructions in the [Getting the Account ID](/v3/platform/settings/account-details/getting-the-account-id) section.

### Procedure

1. Go to the [fabric Developer Portal](https://developer.fabric.inc/).
2. To try an API endpoint, go to the corresponding page.\
   For example, to add an attribute go to the [Create Attribute](/v3/api-reference/product-catalog/attributes/create-attribute) page. You can click the **Examples** menu in the request field to view request examples with data.
3. To run the API request, do the following:
   * In the **Bearer** field in the right pane, enter the access token.
   * In the **BODY PARAMS** section, enter the required setting for each parameter.
   * In the **Headers** section, enter the required setting for each parameter.
   * In the right pane, click **Try it**.

The response is displayed in JSON format. You can also click the Examples menu in the right pane to see different response examples.

# Authorize user apps with and without PKCE
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/authentication-endpoints/authorize-user-app-with-and-without-pkce

authentication_v3 get /oauth2/default/v1/authorize
Use this endpoint to authenticate user apps using fabric Identity. When calling this endpoint, the immediate response will be a browser redirect to the hosted Login page configured in fabric Identity. After successful authentication of the user on the hosted Login page, fabric Identity will redirect back to the user app using the provided `redirect_uri`. This endpoint supports both authorization code flow with and without Proof of Code Exchange (PKCE). <br /> **Note**: This endpoint isn't required for system app authentication (refer to `/token` endpoint instead)



# Fetch access token
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/authentication-endpoints/fetch-access-token

authentication_v3 post /oauth2/{authServerId}/v1/token
This endpoint allows apps to fetch access tokens. For user apps, use this endpoint after the `/authorize` endpoint and the subsequent callback. For user apps this endpoint supports generation of access token from authorization code or from refresh token, sent in the previous `authorize` endpoint's callback. For system apps this endpoint can directly be used to get an access token, no prior `/authorize` end point call is needed.<br/><b><span style={{color: 'red'}}>NOTE: Fetching a token for a system app via the browser on our developer portal WILL NOT WORK as browser requests to the token endpoint must use PKCE.</span></b> Instead, send the request through a server side/native method and ensure the 'Origin' header isn't present.



# Authentication Endpoints
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/authentication-endpoints/overview



These APIs allow apps to authenticate themselves or their end users with fabric Identity. The objective of these APIs is to return an access token to apps, which can then be used to invoke other fabric APIs.

[Download Postman Collection](https://github.com/FabricCommerce/public-fabric-api-postman-collections/blob/main/v3/identity.json)


# Concepts
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/concepts



### App

All API clients calling any of the fabric platform APIs are logically defined within fabric Identity as **apps**. Each app needs to secure an access token from fabric Identity before invoking other fabric APIs.

### Authentication

**Authentication** is the mechanism of validating the identity of an app or its end user with fabric Identity. Once the app or end user is confirmed, fabric Identity generates and signs an access token. This access token is used by apps as a [bearer token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) to call fabric platform APIs.

### Authorization

**Authorization** is the mechanism that restricts access to certain APIs after successful authentication. fabric Identity supports role-based access control of all its platform APIs. This means applications and application end users can be assigned the necessary roles to access only required fabric platform APIs.

### Access Control

If users are who they say they're (authentication), and they have permission to access resources (authorization), **access control** verifies that the user has permission to access the requested resource.

### Authentication/Authorization/Access Control Example

Pat E. Smith and Sandy Beaches both have reservations at the fabric Arms hotel. Pat, however, is a member of the hotel’s loyalty program, and will have a deluxe room, with access to the fabric Lounge, while Sandy has reserved a regular room. Pat and Sandy show up at the same time to check in. The front desk agents ask them for their driver’s licenses to make sure they're who they say they are. This is **authentication**.

While preparing the key cards for the two guests, the hotel system **authorizes** Pat for access to a specific deluxe room, the fabric Lounge, and the hotel’s exercise room. It also **authorizes** Sandy for access to a specific standard room, and the hotel’s exercise room. Once made and programmed, Pat and Sandy receive their key cards.

Pat and Sandy go to their individual rooms, and their key cards provide access to their rooms. Pat goes down to exercise, and the key card reader on the exercise room acknowledges that the key card has been authorized for that room. Sandy, who is a bit of a rebel, tries to get into the fabric Lounge. The key card reader on the lounge door sends the card info to the **access control** server, which determines that Sandy doesn't have access, and Sandy isn't allowed in the lounge.

### App Types

App types help determine how apps authenticate with fabric Identity and use its features.

![User App vs System App](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fabric-demo/images/user-app-vs-sys-app.png "User App vs System App")

A **user app** uses fabric Identity to authenticate its end users. Based on the flow selected (*Authorization Code Flow* or *Authorization Code Flow with PKCE*), the app needs a client ID and optionally a client secret. A user app relies on the login page hosted by fabric Identity to log in its end users. This is suitable for e-commerce apps that direct their authentication and authorization needs to fabric Identity. fabric Identity provides several out-of-the-box features for such applications; this allows developers to focus on the user commerce experience, rather than on user login, authentication, and authorization.

A **system app** generates an access token to identify itself using a client ID and client secret. These apps don't use fabric Identity to authenticate their end users; rather they use system-to-system communications with fabric APIs. Typical use cases include applications like ERP, OMS, and WMS making calls to fabric APIs to update inventory, change pricing rules, refund orders, etc.

### User Pools

**User pools** help developers provide single sign-on capability to their applications' end users.

![User Pools](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fabric-demo/images/user-pools.png "User Pools")

Before using fabric Identity to implement single sign-on, it's important to define user pools and associate the pools with one or more user app. User apps in the same user pool can validate the access token of any logged-in pool user, allowing SSO within that pool.

New users registering themselves in a user app (for example, shopper self-registration in the ecommerce app) will be created in the user pools associated with the user app. Apps can then use the user's access token to switch between user apps within the same user pool.

As system apps don't authenticate any end users, they're not associated with user pools.

### Access Token

An **access token** is a [signed JWT token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON%5FWeb%5FToken) provided to an app after successful authentication by fabric Identity. After an access token that has been provided to a user app for an individual end user has been successfully authenticated, it will be referred to as a **user token**. An access token provided to a system app serves the app itself, rather than an end user, and is referred to as a **system token**.

User tokens and system tokens should be authentication Bearer tokens when invoking fabric platform APIs.

By default, user tokens are valid for 30 minutes. Once a user's access token is expired, a user app can get a new access token for the end user by using the refresh token. This avoids requiring the logged-in end user to go through the login page again.

By default, system tokens are valid for 10 minutes. Once expired, system apps must reauthenticate and generate a new access token. Refresh tokens aren't generated for system apps.

### Refresh Token

A **refresh token** is a [signed JWT token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON%5FWeb%5FToken) received by a user app, along with the access token. A user app uses the refresh token to get a new access token once the previous token expires, without having the end user go to a login page again.

Every time a refresh token is used to get a new access token, a new refresh token is also generated. This token should be stored by the app and should be treated as sensitive as an access token itself.

### OpenID Connect

**OpenID Connect** is an established standard based on OAuth 2.0, which defines authentication flows specific to the needs of cloud based applications. Please refer to [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) for further details.

fabric Identity supports the following flows within OpenID Connect:

* *Authorization Code Flow with PKCE*: Recommended for all **web app** apps
* *Client Credential Flow*: For all **headless** apps

For devices and applications that don't support PKCE, fabric Identity supports the regular *Authorization Code Flow (without PKCE)*. However, this option is recommended only when the app has a [backend for frontend](https://medium.com/mobilepeople/backend-for-frontend-pattern-why-you-need-to-know-it-46f94ce420b0) pattern implemented.


# Getting Started with System Apps
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/system-apps/getting-started-with-system-apps



Create a system app with fabric Identity and ensure the following details are available before starting the authentication flow.

`client-id` - A unique ID that represents the system app, and is required for OpenID Connect authentication flows.

`client-secret` - An app-specific secret that allows fabric Identity to validate the system app. This secret is mandatory for system apps to integrate with fabric Identity.

`Authorization Url` - The fabric Identity HTTP endpoint that the system app communicates with to get its access token. Every fabric merchant is provided with a unique URL.

<Note> Currently, fabric customers don't have a self-service capability to create the system app and get the `client-id`, `client-secret`, and `Authorization Url` by themselves. Contact [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new) for help in creating these. </Note>


# System App Authentication
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/system-apps/system-app-authentication



A system app uses OpenID Connect's [Client Credential Flow](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) to obtain an access token referred to as **system token**. Before starting, ensure the necessary app credentials and URLs are available as mentioned in the [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/authentication-endpoints/fetch-access-token) guide.

### Getting system token

In the [Client Credential Flow](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4), get an access token by calling the `/token` endpoint:

`curl --location --request POST '${Authorization Url}/v1/token' \ --header 'accept: application/json' \ --header 'authorization: Basic <base64(${client-id}:${client-secret})>' \ --header 'cache-control: no-cache' \ --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \ --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \ --data-urlencode 'scope=s2s'
`

The `authorization:` header in the request above is determined per [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic%5Faccess%5Fauthentication) where the `client-id` and `client-secret` are used as *username* and *password*, respectively. `Authorization Url` is a unique URL of each fabric merchant. It's common across all system apps defined for a single merchant.

fabric Identity returns the access token in the following response:

`{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiIt...",
    "scope": "s2s"
}
`

`access_token` is the system token generated by fabric Identity and is used by the system app for all subsequent fabric API calls. System token expiration is set to 10 minutes (600 seconds) by default. Once the token expires, the API client is expected to generate another access token using the same HTTP call shown above.

### Using system token

Upon receiving a valid access token, the API client can call any fabric API by specifying the `access_token` as the [Bearer token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) in the `authorization` header:

`curl --location --request GET '${fabric Endpoint Url}/v1/product' \ --header 'accept: application/json' \ --header 'authorization: Bearer ${access_token}' \ --header 'cache-control: no-cache' \
`


# Best Practices for Customizing Login Flows
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/user-apps/best-practices-for-customizing-login-flows



fabric Identity supports only the Okta hosted login page for customizing and styling. Here are some best practices that fabric recommends when customizing the login flows.

### Login page domain name

Use a subdomain of the user app's actual domain to host the login page. For example, if the user app is hosted on the domain `example.com`, use a subdomain such as `login.example.com` for the Okta org. Because the hosted login page is a redirect from the user app, making it appear under a subdomain increases the end users' confidence to provide their credentials on the login page.

The Okta org domain name is also used in email communications sent to the user (welcome email, forgot password email, etc.). Make sure you test these flows during development to ensure that they're redirecting the user to the intended login page.

### Common SSO branding

The hosted login page is the same for all user apps within a single user pool. Hence, if the same user pool allows single sign on for users across multiple brands, the login page should be styled and themed as a common entry point for all of the brands.

### Minimize non-login related customizations within the login page

Okta uses inline JavaScript to customize its hosted login page. This allows developers to customize the login page to implement custom functionality. fabric recommends that the customizations are limited only to the user app's login functionality. For example, while it's possible to have dynamic headers and footers on the login page (by making a `fetch` call), they're not recommended on the login page because they're not related to login functionality. Instead, use static headers and footers on the login page.

### Use a separate user pool for each environment served by the same fabric merchant

A single fabric Copilot merchant can support multiple user pools. If the development team is using a single sandbox for both development and staging environments of a user app, ensure that two separate user apps are created in separate user pools of the same merchant. By default, fabric Identity creates one user pool per fabric merchant. Additional user pools can be created upon request.

### Implement custom validation when extending the self-registration form

Okta allows extending the user registration form to request additional details from the user during signup. For these additional fields, ensure that you implement the necessary validations in the custom login page. While Okta supports designating which of these additional details are mandatory, it can't validate field format or value. For example, it can't, by itself, validate if an entered ZIP code is a valid ZIP code. Currently, the only field types allowed are `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `integer`.

### Understand how Okta's Sign-In Widget works

Most login customization can be done by setting the appropriate configurations on Okta's Sign-In Widget, or by providing callback handlers to this widget. The API for this is documented [here](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#api-reference). fabric strongly recommends that app developers read this documentation before creating custom login pages.


# Customizing Customer Login
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/user-apps/customizing-customer-login



fabric Identity uses [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) for managing users, login pages, and several account management flows. In fabric Identity, a separate [Okta organization](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/) (org) is created for every user pool. By default, a new Okta org is created for each merchant in fabric, associated with that merchant's default user pool. Upon request, additional user pools - and Okta orgs - can be created for any merchant.

Using Okta allows app developers to customize several aspects of user login and management. This section describes customizations to individual Okta orgs.

### Login Page

When using user apps, the user login page is hosted by the fabric-provisioned Okta org. This login page uses simple HTML that leverages the Okta sign-in widget, and allows app developers to add additional customizations. Customization examples include:

* Changing the host name of the login page to use a merchant's specific sub-domain.
* Styling the login page and the sign-in widget to any custom theme using CSS. As it's plain HTML, any additional headers and footers can also be included in the login page to align with the storefront.
* Including any additional login or remote calls by embedding JavaScript within the HTML page
* Writing hooks into the Okta sign-in widget, which further allows Okta to handle events within the login flow.

Currently, fabric supports only Okta's hosted login page.

See [this page](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Settings/custom-okta-hosted-sign-in-page.htm) for further details on customizations available.

### Password Policies

By default, fabric Identity applies the following password policy for end users of the user app:

* Minimum of 8 character length
* At least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one number
* The password shouldn't have any part of the user's name
* The password shouldn't be one of the last 4 passwords (when resetting)
* The user locks out by 10 unsuccessful attempts.

Okta allows defining custom password policies that can customized for password strength, password aging, and lockout behavior. All of these are possible with Okta's simple configuration. More details can be found [on this page](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/policies/configure-password-policies.htm).

### Self-Service Registration

Okta allows end users to register themselves through an email verification process. This can be enabled as a feature flag on Okta and is enabled by default for new merchants within fabric. Additional details of the end users can be requested by customizing the registration form. When using fabric customer APIs, these details are also available for the new customer record created for the self-registered user.

See [this page](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-self-service.htm) for further instructions on how to customize the registration form.

### Support for Social Login

Storefronts often need to support social logins using Meta (formerly Facebook), Google, etc. Okta's in-built support for all major social media logins makes it easy for app developers to include this in their designs.

See [this page](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/identity-providers/) for instructions on how to integrate social logins with the login page.

### Email Templates

Okta provides the ability to customize auth-related emails sent to end users according to a merchant's branding and styling. It allows simple branding changes by defining foreground and background color schemes, including merchant logos, and customizing the sender email ID. For extensive customizations, it also provides an HTML-based template editor for individual emails. fabric Identity supports the following emails sent through Okta:

* Registration
* Email verification
* User activation
* Forgot password

Please contact [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get access to Okta org in order to perform these customizations.


# Getting Started with User Apps
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-user-apps



fabric Identity provides a default user pool for all user apps created by a particular merchant. If the developers need to separate the user app end users, new user pools can be created and associated with the respective user apps.

Before integrating a user app with fabric Identity, determine the authentication scenario for the app by answering the following questions:

* Does this user app need to share end users with other apps? If so, have the necessary user pools been created?
* Which flow will the user app use?
  * *Authorization Code Flow with PKCE*: fabric recommends using this flow for all user applications unless there is no PKCE support available within a specific device or browser.
  * *Authorization Code Flow*: This is the classic [Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1%5F0.html#CodeFlowAuth) mentioned in the OpenID Connect specification. It should be used only if PKCE flow isn't supported in the app environment. This flow requires a [backend-for-frontend](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) layer within the user app that, in turn, integrates with fabric Identity.
* What's the user app's domain name? This is required for fabric Identity to whitelist the application's `redirect-url`, which is required as part of the authentication flow.

Once these questions are answered, create a user app to represent the actual app being built, and provide the user pool, authorization flow, and app domain details determined above. If you need new user pools, create them before creating the user apps. Before integrating with fabric Identity, ensure the following details are available for each user app :

`client-id` - A unique ID that represents the user app, and is required for OpenID Connect authentication flows.

`client-secret` - An app-specific secret that allows fabric Identity to validate the user app. This is required only if the user app will use the classic [Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1%5F0.html#CodeFlowAuth) defined in the OpenID Connect specification.

`Authorization Url` - The fabric Identity HTTP endpoint that the user app communicates with to get its access token.

Currently, fabric customers don't have self-service capability to create user pools and user apps by themselves. Contact [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new) for help in creating these.


# Migrate Existing Users to a User App
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/user-apps/migrate-existing-users-to-a-user-app



fabric's customers often need to migrate existing users from their current IDP solutions to fabric Identity. This can be achieved by using the *bulk user import feature* available in fabric Identity.

To help perform the import, provide fabric Identity with a CSV file containing the following details about each user.

| Column Name  | Is Mandatory | Comments                                |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | Yes          | Row identifier in the CSV               |
| `firstName`  | Yes          | User's first name                       |
| `lastName`   | Yes          | User's last name                        |
| `middleName` | No           | User's middle name                      |
| `email`      | Yes          | User's email address                    |
| `login`      | Yes          | User's login ID (usually email address) |

Note:

* Column names in the CSV file must match those above.
* User uniqueness is based on email.
* This process doesn't support passwords.

If users have additional fields to be imported, please refer to fabric's [Customer API documentation](/v3/api-reference/customers/customer-profile/add-a-new-customer).

### End user experience

Following successful bulk user import, the end users must use the forgot password flow (available from the login page) to reset their passwords.

fabric recommends that the login page be customized to prompt the users about the security solution change, and to use the forgot password flow to reset their passwords.

<Note> Currently, this bulk user import can be performed only by fabric, upon request. Contact [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new) for help with user imports. </Note>


# User App Authentication
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/user-apps/user-app-authentication



A user app can authenticate with fabric Identity in one of two ways:

* [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)
* [Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1%5F0.html#CodeFlowAuth)

### Using Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (recommended)

This flow requires the following parameters (for more information, see the [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-userapps) guide):

`client-id` - A unique ID that represents the user app, and is required for OpenID Connect authentication flows.

`Authorization Url` - The fabric Identity HTTP endpoint that the user app communicates with to get its access token.

Once these are available, you can build the authentication flow as depicted below:

![Authentication Flow with PKCE](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fabric-demo/images/auth-flow-with-pkce.png "Authentication Flow with PKCE")

**1. Generate PKCE `code-verifier` and `code-challenge`**

In this step, the single page app or mobile app, represented by the respective user app in fabric Identity, generates a `code-verifier`, which you will use to generate the `code-challenge`. These codes ensure that the access token returned by fabric Identity (step 8) is returned to the correct requestor.

`code-verifier`: Random URL-safe string of at least 43 characters. [Click here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4.1) for more details.

`code-challenge`: Base64 URL-encoded SHA-256 hash of the `code-verifier`.

The app should store the `code-verifier` securely to be used later (step 6). The `code-challenge` is sent earlier in the call to the `/authorize` endpoint (step 2).

**2. Authorization code request with `code-challenge` to `/authorize`**

In this step, the app should send a GET request to fabric Identity's `/authorize` endpoint and load the GET URL into the `window.location`. This allows fabric Identity to send a browser redirect, and take the end user to the hosted login page.

This is a representation of the URL that should be constructed and loaded into `window.location`:

```
https://${Authorization Url}/v1/authorize?client_id=${client-id}&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=${redirect-uri}&state=${state}&code_challenge_method=S256&code_challenge=<sha256(${code-verifier})>
```

* `Authorization Url`: The URL made available upon creating a user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-userapps) for more details.
* `client-id`: A unique ID that represents the user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-userapps) for more details.
* `redirect-uri`: The URI that fabric Identity redirects to after successful authentication. This should be a URI of the requesting user app and should contain a temporary authorization code (see step 5). The app should use the query parameters on the `redirect-uri` to complete the authentication flow with fabric Identity.
* `state`: An opaque value (can be a random string) the app uses to maintain state between the request and callback from fabric Identity. This parameter is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery. [Click here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1) for more information.
* `code_challenge`: An SHA256 hash of the `code-verifier`. [Click here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4.2) for more details.

**3. fabric Identity sends 302 redirect to authentication prompt**

As a response to step 2, fabric Identity sends a redirect to the client browser to bring up the hosted login page. This hosted login page can also be configured for social logins, sign-up, and forgot-password links.

**4. Enter credentials and provide consent**

End users provide their credentials for authentication. If requested to do so, they will also indicate consent to have fabric Identity share their basic profile information with the calling app.

**5. Authorization code response returned to the specified redirect URI**

After a successful login, fabric Identity redirects the end user to the `redirect-uri` defined in step 2. As part of this redirect, fabric Identity sends the following additional details as query parameters:

* `code`: A temporary authorization code which will be returned to fabric Identity along with `code-verifier` to get an access token.
* `state`: The same `state` sent by the app to fabric Identity in step 2.

**6. Send authorization code with `code-verifier`**

Once the app receives the redirect from fabric Identity, it validates that the `state` field matches the one sent in step 2. After validation, the app fetches an access token by using the `code` to make a POST request to fabric Identity.

Example of the POST request (represented as a curl command):

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://${Authorization Url}/v1/token \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code'
  -d 'client_id=${client-id}'
  -d 'redirect_uri=${redirect-uri}'
  -d 'code=${code}'
  -d 'code_verifier=${code-verifier}'
```

* `Authorization Url`: The URL made available upon creating a user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-userapps) for more details.
* `client-id`: A unique ID that represents the user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-userapps) for more details.
* `redirect-uri`: The same URI that the app originally sent to fabric Identity in step 2.
* `code`: The authorization code received by the app in step 5.
* `code-verifier`: The original `code-verifier` generated by the app in step 1.

**7. Validate `code-verifier`**

Once the POST request is received by the `/token` endpoint, fabric Identity validates the `code-verifier` by computing its SHA256 value, and verifying that against the `code-challenge` the app sent in step 2. If successfully validated, the endpoint returns the response, which includes the access token (next step).

**8. Respond with access token**

Upon successful `code-verifier` validation, fabric Identity returns the response with the access token:

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJ...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJI...",
    "refresh_token": "cBMrwDsXRwPqVmCQx7I5IX0jQ9-Lc_zHOgYeab1xZm4"
    "scope": "openid offline_access",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

The `access_token` returned in the response above is a [user token](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/concepts#access-token) that has a default expiration of 30 minutes (3600 seconds). This token is used by the app as a [bearer token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) to access fabric APIs.

The response also contains a `refresh_token`, which the app can use to fetch a new `access_token` when previous one expires.

**9. Request fabric platform API access using access token as bearer token**

The app can now invoke any fabric API using the `access_token` received in the previous step. This token is sent in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token, which is then validated by the fabric API.

App developers can use third-party libraries ([Click here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-pkce) for an example) to achieve the authentication flows described above.

### Using Authorization Code Flow

fabric recommends using authorization code flow only when lacking browser support for PKCE. Also, as this flow needs the user app to pass the `client-secret`, it's essential that the app implements a backend for frontend (BFF) layer to exchange tokens with fabric Identity.

Ensure the following parameters are available before getting started with this authentication flow (for more information, see the [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-user-apps) guide):

`client-id` - A unique ID that represents the user app, and is required for OpenID Connect authentication flows.

`client-secret` - An app-specific secret that allows fabric Identity to validate the user app.

`Authorization Url` - The fabric Identity HTTP endpoint that the user app communicates with to get its access token.

Once these are available, you can build the authentication flow as depicted below:

![Authentication Flow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fabric-demo/images/auth-code-flow.png "Authentication Flow without PKCE")

**1. Authorization code request to /authorize**

In this step, the app should send a GET request to fabric Identity's `/authorize` endpoint and load the GET URL into the `window.location`. This allows fabric Identity to send a browser redirect, and take the end user to the hosted login page.

This is a representation of the URL that should be constructed and loaded into `window.location`:

```
https://${Authorization Url}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize?client_id=${client-id}&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=${redirect-uri}&state=${state}
```

* `Authorization Url`: The URL made available upon creating a user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-userapps) for more details.
* `client-id`: A unique ID that represents the user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-userapps) for more details.
* `redirect-uri`: The URI that fabric Identity redirects to after successful authentication. This should be a URI of the requesting user app and should contain a temporary authorization code (see step 4). The app should use the query parameters on the `redirect-uri` to complete the authentication flow with fabric Identity.
* `state`: An opaque value (can be a random string) the app uses to maintain state between the request and callback from fabric Identity. This parameter is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery. [Click here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1) for more information.
* `code_challenge`: An SHA256 hash of the `code-verifier`. [Click here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4.2) for more details.

**2. fabric Identity sends 302 redirect to authentication prompt**

As a response to step 1, fabric Identity sends a redirect to the client browser to bring up the hosted login page. This hosted login page can also be configured for social logins, sign-up, and forgot-password links.

**3. Enter credentials and provide consent**

End users provide their credentials for authentication. If requested to do so, they will also indicate consent to have fabric Identity share their basic profile information with the calling app.

**4. Authorization code response returned to the specified redirect URI**

After a successful login, fabric Identity redirects the end user to the `redirect-uri` defined in step 1. As part of this redirect, fabric Identity sends the following additional details as query parameters:

* `code`: A temporary authorization code which will be returned to fabric Identity. This code would be used in step 5 and 6 to finally fetch the access token.
* `state`: The same `state` sent by the app to fabric Identity in step 1.

**5. Send authorization code to BFF**

The browser component of the user app sends the `code` (received in step 4) to the BFF (backend for frontend) component of the app. This is done so that browser loading JS files can avoid having the `client-secret` visible to the end user. This is a custom implementation done by the developer, as it's a call between the browser and the BFF layer of their user app.

**6. Send `client-secret` to fetch access token**

The BFF layer of the user app sends the `code` (received in step 5) along with the `client-secret` to authorization server. Upon validating the `client-secret`, the authorization server sends the access token in the response of this call.

Following is an example of the POST request that's made by the BFF layer to the authorization server:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://${Authorization Url}/v1/token \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Authorization: <base64(${client-id}:${client-secret})>
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code'
  -d 'redirect_uri=${redirect-uri}'
  -d 'code=${code}'
```

* `Authorization Url`: The URL made available upon creating a user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-user-apps) for more details.
* `client-id`: A unique ID that represents the user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-user-apps) for more details.
* `client-secret` - An app-specific secret that allows fabric Identity to validate the user app.
* `redirect-uri`: The same URI that the app originally sent to fabric Identity in step 2.
* `code`: The authorization code received by the app in step 5.

Upon successful validation of `client-secret`, fabric Identity returns the response that includes the access token:

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJ...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJI...",
    "refresh_token": "cBMrwDsXRwPqVmCQx7I5IX0jQ9-Lc_zHOgYeab1xZm4"
    "scope": "openid offline_access",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

The `access_token` returned in the response above is a [user token](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/concepts#access-token) that has a default expiration of 30 minutes (3600 seconds). This token is used by the app as a [bearer token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) to access fabric APIs.

The response also contains a `refresh_token`, which the app can use to fetch a new `access_token` when previous one expires.

**7. Send the access token to save in session storage**

This is a custom implementation done by the developer ensuring that the access token is saved on the end user's session store within the browser so that it can be used by the user app in all subsequent calls to fabric APIs.

**8. Request fabric platform API using access token as bearer token**

The app can now invoke any fabric API using the `access_token` received in the previous step. This token is sent in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token, which is then validated by the fabric API.

### Refresh Access Token

User tokens generated by fabric Identity have a default expiration of 30 minutes. Refresh tokens, on the other hand are longer-living tokens and can be used to retrieve new access tokens without asking the end user to login again. For security reasons, every time a refresh token is used to get a new access token, the previous refresh token is discarded and a new one is created. Refresh tokens are also discarded if not used for seven days. If a refresh token expires, the app can follow the previous authentication flow and have the end user login again.

Sample call to get a new access token from a refresh token:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://${Authorization Url}/v1/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=${redirect-uri}' \
--data-urlencode 'scope=offline_access openid' \
--data-urlencode 'refresh_token=${refresh-token}' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=${client-id}'
```

* `Authorization Url`: The URL made available upon creating a user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-user-apps) for more details.
* `client-id`: A unique ID that represents the user app. See [Getting Started](/v3/api-reference/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-user-apps) for more details.
* `redirect-uri`: The same URI that the app originally sent to fabric Identity in step 2.
* `refresh-token`: Refresh token received by the app along with the access token.

Sample response sent from fabric Identity for the refresh request:

```json
{

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/copilot/fabric-ai/overview



fabric AI is an innovative business assistant that analyzes real-time data, identifies issues, and offers tailored solutions to provide actionable insights for retailers to streamline operations, optimize workflows, and improve decision-making.

fabric AI's natural language interface in Copilot allows users to ask their own questions, or select from prompts, such as *Which locations could be impacting my margins?* or *Which products need improved SEO descriptions?* to uncover and address potential issues before they escalate.

## Transforming Workflows

fabric AI's interface is accessible directly from Copilot's homepage. After navigating to modules such as **Product Catalog**, **Orders**, or **Inventory**, fabric AI shifts to the right panel. With fabric AI as an assistant through every phase of operational workflows, users can:

* **Interact with operational data:** Access and explore data to gain insights and implement changes directly within the system.

* **Analyze and optimize workflows:** Gain actionable insights to improve fulfillment performance, product content, order, and inventory management.

* **Automate repetitive tasks:** Reduce manual effort with recommendations and content generation.

* **Respond in real time:** Address issues and make informed decisions quickly, using real-time data and insights to minimize disruptions and improve outcomes.

## Use Case

A home furnishings retailer uses fabric to manage their product catalog, inventory, and fulfillment operations across its network of stores and distribution centers.

The retailer specializes in high-quality furniture and decor. Their business success depends on optimizing product visibility, maintaining efficient inventory levels, and ensuring seamless order fulfillment to meet customer expectations.

### Identifying challenges

During a weekly review, the merchandising team notes lagging SEO performance for several products, affecting site traffic and sales. At the same time, the fulfillment team observes an uptick in canceled orders and delayed deliveries, particularly in one region.

### Using fabric AI

The teams begin by using Product Catalog AI to analyze the SEO performance of their products by asking *Which products need SEO improvements?* Product Catalog AI evaluates their products and identifies a list of under-performing products with issues such as generic descriptions, missing keywords, and inconsistent metadata.

Next, they use Fulfillment AI to investigate the causes behind fulfillment inefficiencies by asking *What’s driving fulfillment issues this week?* Fulfillment AI pinpoints a cluster of stores in one region contributing to high bounce rates due to inventory shortages and performance inconsistencies.

fabric AI provides tailored recommendations for both areas:

* **Catalog optimization:** Product Catalog AI uncovers a popular dining table SKU identified as having poor SEO. It generates an optimized description aligned with the retailer’s branding and provides actionable metadata corrections to improve visibility. These updates are approved and published immediately.

* **Fulfillment rule updates:** Fulfillment AI suggests creating a new inventory rule to prioritize high-performing locations and adjusting order orchestration rules to prevent delays. The new rule is applied with a single click, ensuring orders are routed more efficiently.

### Unlocking new opportunities

With the immediate challenges addressed, fabric AI proactively identifies additional opportunities for growth. For example, it suggests expanding the product offering by adding matching chairs to the dining table category. It also recommends ongoing monitoring of fulfillment performance metrics to ensure continued optimization and identify future improvements.

It also helps the retailer overcome operational hurdles while unlocking strategic opportunities. By combining insights from Catalog AI and Fulfillment AI, the teams improve product visibility, enhance fulfillment efficiency, and ensure customer satisfaction.

These capabilities enable the retailer to maintain seamless operations, boost revenue, and uncover new growth opportunities—all while saving time and resources through AI-driven automation.

## fabric AI Rules

fabric AI uses a rules-based framework to govern operational processes such as inventory allocation, fulfillment logic, and product data optimization. By leveraging AI-driven insights and predefined logic, fabric AI dynamically updates rules to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance performance.

The fabric AI rules framework operates through a structured process:

* **Data Analysis:**
  fabric AI collects and evaluates operational data to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. Metrics and sub-metrics are tailored to each domain, such as fulfillment performance or product content quality.

* **Rule Evaluation and Suggestion:**
  Existing rules are assessed against operational performance and predefined thresholds. fabric AI provides actionable updates to enhance efficiency and maintain consistency.

* **Implementation:**
  Users can review and apply fabric AI’s suggestions directly in Copilot. Changes are validated for accuracy and implemented in real time, ensuring seamless integration into workflows.

# Product Catalog AI
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/getting-started/copilot/fabric-ai/product-catalog-ai



Product Catalog AI is [fabric AI’s](/v3/guides/get-started/fabric-ai/overview) specialized functionality for **Product Catalog**, designed to help retailers optimize and maintain high-quality product data.

By providing targeted insights and recommendations, Product Catalog AI enables merchandisers to enhance product visibility, align content with brand and SEO standards, and ensure accurate, engaging product information across channels.

## Key Capabilities

### Product description analysis

Product Catalog AI evaluates product descriptions using a set of proprietary criteria to surface content to users that's non-optimized. Some of the evaluation criteria used includes: accuracy, clarity, SEO, and unique merchant preferences such as tone of voice. A detailed analysis is shown to the user with a score of 'Good' or 'Poor' for each criteria, as well as a written explanation for how each score was determined. This analysis of descriptions is done in real time, reduces manual efforts by days, if not weeks, and helps merchandising teams focus on products that need optimization.

### Content generation

Product Catalog AI generates optimized product descriptions tailored to your industry, brand voice, and SEO requirements. For example, if you sell home decor, Product Catalog AI can update a generic description, such as "A stylish lamp for your living room" into "Elevate your living space with this modern table lamp featuring a sleek brushed metal finish and adjustable brightness—perfect for creating a cozy ambiance." These improvements help you create compelling content more efficiently.

### Automated Workflows

Product Catalog AI gives the user quick actions such as 'Apply Suggestion' to automatically navigate the user to the appropriate page to implement the recommended content. It makes analyzing, generating, and updating descriptions a breeze so merchandising teams can push their updated product data to all sales channels immediately.

## Use Case

A merchandiser at a home furnishings retailer receives a report that shows sales for the *decorative mirrors* category of products are under-performing, particularly in regards to SEO. They suspect the issue might lie with the product descriptions and metadata, but lack the time for a manual review.

### Using Product Catalog AI

The merchandiser uses Product Catalog AI to analyze the decorative mirrors category.

1. The merchandiser sends a custom query:
   *How can I improve the SEO and conversion rates for decorative mirrors?*
2. The Product Catalog AI evaluates the category’s product descriptions and provides actionable insights in the following areas:

* Product descriptions are too generic and lack relevant keywords.
* Product Catalog AI generates custom descriptions that match the retailer’s brand voice and are optimized for SEO best practices.

1. After reviewing the recommendations, the merchandiser applies the updates with a single click.
   The updated descriptions are published to sales channels in real-time to boost the category’s SEO rankings, driving more organic traffic to the retailer’s site. Improved product visibility might lead to increased customer engagement and higher conversion rates, addressing the initial issue efficiently.

# Inventory Setup
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/inventory-setup



This document is intended for merchants and their SI (System Integrator) partners who want to set up inventory. It describes the rules and procedures to set up inventory as per the business need.

To set up inventory:

1. [Create Location](#create-location)
2. [Update Product Information](#update-product-information-optional)
3. [Create a Network](#create-a-network)
4. [Create or Update Inventory](#create-or-update-inventory)

Refer to the following sections for additional information:

* [Search Inventory](#query-inventory)
* [Rules for Updating Counter Quantity](#rules-for-updating-counter-quantity)

**General Rules:**

* If you are using a third-party product information management system other than fabric’s Product Catalog, you must provide product details to fabric in a `.csv` file. For details, see the [Update Product Information](#updateproductinfo) section. If you are already using fabric’s Product Catalog to maintain product information, ignore this step.
* To create or update inventory, you must provide `sku`, `itemId`, `location`, `channelId`, and `counters`. You can provide other details to configure the inventory based on your requirements. For details, see the [Create Inventory](#create-or-update-inventory) section.
  * If you are using only the *Inventory service* of fabric (not the entire OMS service), you must mention allocated and shipped counter quantities to update inventory. If you are using fabric’s OMS to manage inventory and order fulfillment, allocated and shipped counter quantities will be taken care of automatically.
* Use the `onHand` counter to represent the inventory quantity that's currently in stock for selling. Per the `onHand` counter value passed in the request body, `availableToPurchase` (the virtual counter) quantity is calculated, based on the formula `onHand - allocated - shipped - safetyStock`. `safetyStock` is also subtracted if you include `safetyStock` value while creating inventory.
* Subscribe to any of the inventory webhook events to get a notification for inventory updates. For sample curl and other details, see [List of Webhook Events](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/list-of-webhook-events).

### Create location

**API Mapping:** POST/v3/locations

Using the `POST/v3/locations` endpoint, you can create records for your stores, with details including postal code, hours of operation, BOPIS enabled, and other custom attributes that are applicable to your business.

**Request Sample:**

```JSON
{
  "locationNumber": 23,

**API Mapping:**

* Use the `PUT/products/{id}` endpoint for updating a single product by ID.
* Use the `PUT/products` endpoint for updating multiple products.

**Sample request to update a single product:**

```JSON

1. Set the `infiniteInventory` parameter to `true` to configure unlimited quantities of inventory.
2. Use `customAttributes` to define any custom attribute that suit your business use case. For example, you can set BOPIS (Buy Online Pickup In Store) to `true` if you are willing to allow shoppers to buy online and pick up an item from the store (based on location number).
3. If you provide values for `backOrderLimit` and `preOrderLimit` while creating inventory, `availableBackorder` and `availablePreorder` virtual-counters are displayed in the response object with the same values as provided in the request body.
4. Configure values for `safetyStock` and `lowStock` fields while creating or updating inventory for better inventory management.

**Rules for updating counter quantity:**

* Use the `onHand` counter to represent the inventory quantity that's currently in stock for selling. Based on the `onHand` counter value as passed in the request body, `availableToPurchase` quantity is calculated based on the formula `onHand - allocated - shipped` and displayed in the response object.
* (Not required if you are using the Order module of fabric OMS) Use the “allocated” counter to represent inventory that's sent to warehouses for fulfillment (only the warehouse can cancel the order at this point).
* (Not required if you are using the Order module of fabric OMS) Use the “shipped” counter to represent inventory that's marked as shipped by the warehouse (at this stage in the life-cycle the order can only be returned).
* Use “backorderReserve” and “preOrderReserve” counters (under counter object) to represent inventory quantity that's permitted for backorder (reserve for restock) or pre-order (inventory quantity on launch date).

**Sample request to create or update inventory:**

```JSON

### Query inventory

After you successfully create an inventory, you can query for inventory information either using the Copilot user interface or using the `POST/v3/inventories/actions/find` endpoint.

* While searching for inventory information, you must include SKU and network code (if you have created a network) as query parameters to get the “Available to Purchase” information.
* While searching for an inventory of type BOPIS (Buy Online Pickup In Store), you must include SKU, `locationNum`, and `channelId` to get information for BOPIS.

**Sample request:**

```JSON
{
  "skus": [
    "SKU1"
  ],
  "itemIds": [
    127122871
  ],
  "locationNumbers": [
    12

      "virtualCounters": {
        "availableToPurchase": 60
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rules for updating counter quantity

* **In stock:** Use the `onHand` counter in the request body to represent inventory that's currently available in the location to sell.
* **In Stock for BOPIS (Buy Online Pickup In Store) for an SKU in a specified radius of zip code or postal code:**
  * Use the `onHand` counter to represent in-stock inventory.
  * Define BOPIS using the `customAttribute` field while creating or updating inventory.
  * Zip code or postal code is identified based on the location number. A location number is generated for a location for which you provide all details such as name, address, type, zip or postal code, and more information while creating the location using the `create location` endpoint.
* **In Stock for BOPIS in a specified store:**
  * Use the `onHand` counter to represent in-stock inventory.
  * Define BOPIS using the `customAttribute` field while creating or updating inventory. A specific store is identified by the location number.
* **Adjust inventory records by increasing or decreasing counter quantity:**
  * Use the `onHand` counter to represent in-stock inventory.
  * Use the `POST/v3/inventories/actions/find-and-adjust-inventory-counters` endpoint to adjust counter quantity. You can provide the SKU, location, and counter quantity in the request payload to adjust the `onHand` counter quantity. Counter quantity accepts both positive and negative values. Based on the value you specify in the request payload for the counter quantity, the original counter quantity is either decreased or increased. For example, if the original counter quantity is 100, and you specify the counter quantity as "-10" in the request payload, then the updated `onHand` counter becomes 90.
* **Displaying Backorder, Preorder, Safety Stock, and Low Stock on Website:**
  * If the `availableToPurchase` value is greater than zero, then calculate if the `availabletoPurchase` quantity is greater than the `safetyStock` value.
    * If `availableToPurchase` quantity is greater than 0, then display the item as **in-stock**.
    * If `availableToPurchase` quantity is equal to 0 and `availableBackorder` is greater than 0, then display the item as **in-stock-for-backorder**.
    * If *Available* and *Backorder* are both out of stock, and `availableToPreorder` is greater than 0, then display the item as **in-stock-for-preorder**, else display the item as **out-of-stock**.
    * If the item is a `Backorder` or `Preorder` item, then display the expected restock date (backorderDate) or expected product launch date (preOrderDate)


# List of Webhook Events
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/list-of-webhook-events



## Overview

Webhooks are a mechanism for an application to send automated, real-time notifications without the need to call REST API endpoints. fabric's Order Management System (OMS) provides a list of webhook events using which you can create event subscriptions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations that take place in fabric OMS (also called fabric Orders). As a merchant, you can configure specific webhook events, such as inventory creation, order creation, order cancellation, and more to receive event-specific information.

# Importing order and inventory data
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/order-and-inventory-import



This document is intended for merchants and System Integrator (SI) partners who want to migrate or import inventory and order data.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Administrator** privileges to fabric Orders. For more information, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.
* Ensure that you have a valid [Authorization Token](/v3/getting-started/api-guides/getting-started-with-fabric-apis) to provide in the header. When generating an authorization token, ensure that the API System App that you are using to generate the token has the correct role assigned. If a token doesn't have the correct role, the following error is returned:

```json
{
not a valid key=value pair (missing equal-sign) in Authorization header: {token}
}
```

* If you have fabric **Products Catalog** enabled for your organization, ensure that you [create and update the product catalog](https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/api-reference/product-catalog/developer-guide#import-product-data-through-bulk-import) before importing inventory. If you are using product management software other than fabric’s Product Catalog, you must import your product data using the [Products endpoint](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/general-product-operations/add-products).
* Ensure that you have at least one [fulfillment location](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/inventory-setup#create-location), such as a Distribution Center (DC).

## Process

To import inventory, you must create an inventory CSV file. Once you have filled in the CSV file, you can upload it to the `inventory-imports` endpoint. With the file uploaded, fabric process's the CSV file and populates your inventory. With your baseline inventory populated, you're ready to update the counters onHand, allocated, and shipped for each location. This populates your total available to purchase amount for each product and populates the inventory for each location.

* [Import Inventory](#importing-inventory)

To import orders, you must create an orders JSON file. Once you have completed the JSON file, you can upload it to the `oms-imports` endpoint. With the file uploaded, fabric process's the JSON file and populates your orders.

* [Import Orders](#importing-orders)

## Importing Inventory

Before using the `inventory-imports` endpoint, you must download and update the **Update** CSV file template. This file is uploaded in a subsequent API call.

### Step 1: Download the CSV template file

1. Log in to fabric Copilot.

2. In the left menu, click **Inventory**.

   The **Manage inventory** tab is displayed.

3. Click **Import**.

   The **Import CSV file to add or edit your inventory** window is displayed. Two templates are provided.

4. Click **Template: Update**.

The **inventory\_update.csv** file is downloaded.

### Step 2: Update the CSV template file

The **inventory\_update.csv** file contains a number of columns with optional fields, such as preorder and backorder dates. These fields are set to **Null** by the system if left blank. The following values are required:

| Field               | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SKU**             | The stock keeping unit.                                                                                                          |
| **Item ID**         | The fabric item ID generated after a successful import of a product. This is required only if you use fabric Product Catalog.    |
| **Location Number** | A unique value used to identify the location such as a DC. Products can have multiple locations associated with their inventory. |
| **Channel ID**      | The sales channel ID.                                                                                                            |

### Step 3: Create the `importId`

The `inventory-imports` endpoint is used to create the `importId` and returns a `uploadFileUrl`. The `uploadFileUrl` is used to upload the CSV file from [step 2](#step-2-update-the-template-csv-file) that populates your inventory levels.

**POST Request**:

```Bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.fabric.inc/api/v3/inventory-imports/' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: {tenantId}' \
--header 'x-fabric-channel-id: 12' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: {authToken} \
--data '{
    "fileName": "C:/Users/Fabric/Downloads/Inventory_Import.csv",
    "type": "INVENTORY"
}'
```

**Response**:

```Bash
{
    "importId": "1716414052775_CUsersFabricDownloadsInventory_Import",
    "uploadFileUrl": "{AWS S3 upload URL}"
}
```

### Step 4: Upload the template file

Use the `uploadFileUrl` value, which is returned in [step 3](#step-3-create-the-importid), and send a **PUT** request with the template file.

Note: No authorization token is required for this step. If you use Postman, click the URL to automatically open the request in a new tab. Remember to change the request from GET to PUT and in the body of the request click the binary option followed by providing your inventory CSV file.

```Bash
curl --location --request PUT '{AWS S3 upload URL}' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/csv' \
--data '@/C:/Users/Fabric/Downloads/Inventory_Import.csv'
```

A successful response returns a 200 status.

### Step 5: Check the upload status

Ensure that you have the `importId` value from the response in [Step 3](#step-3-create-the-importid).

You can check your inventory upload status by making a **GET** request to the `inventory-imports/{importId}` endpoint.

**GET Request**:

```Bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.fabric.inc/api/v3/inventory-imports/1716408181352_Inventory_Import' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: {tenantId}' \
--header 'x-fabric-channel-id: 12' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: {authToken}'
```

**Response**:

```Bash
{
    "importId": "1716414052775_CUsersFabricDownloadsInventory_Import",
    "type": "bulk",
    "statusCode": "COMPLETED",
    "attributes": {
        "isTrueUp": false
    },
    "createdAt": "2024-05-22T20:03:01Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-05-22T20:03:02Z",
    "originalFileUrl": "{AWS S3 upload URL}",
    "importCount": {
        "uploaded": 1,
        "processed": 1,
        "error": 0
    }
}
```

On the **Manage inventory** page mentioned in [step 1](#step-1-download-the-template-csv-file), the **Available To Purchase** column for each SKU is updated. Note that you may need to refresh your browser to see the update.

### Step 6: Update inventory counters

After importing your inventory, update the default counters for **onHand**, **allocated**, and **shipped** for each product. Custom counters are supported and can be created using the [Counters API](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/counters/create-counter) endpoint.

**PUT Request**:

```Bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/inventories/actions/find-and-adjust-inventory-counters' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {authorizationToken}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-fabric-channel-id: 12' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: {tenantId}' \
--data '{
  "inventoryId": "664fabec0f0853fe68e2bea8",
  "sku": "123456",
  "itemId": 12332,
  "locationNumber": 90012,
  "counters": {
    "allocated": 50,
    "onHand": 200,
    "shipped": 20
  }
}'
```

**Response**:

With the inventory counters updated, the fabric virtual counter also updates the SKU's **Available To Purchase** value. In the following example, the value is updated to 130:

```JSON
{
    "inventoryId": "664e51c60f0853fe681fc3e6",
    "sku": "123456",
    "itemId": 12332,
    "locationNumber": 90012,
    "channelId": "12",
    "createdAt": "2024-05-22T20:12:54.082+00:00",
    "updatedAt": "2024-05-24T22:03:51.903+00:00",
    "backorderLimit": 0,
    "preorderLimit": 0,
    "safetyStock": 0,
    "lowStock": 0,
    "counters": {
        "allocated": 50,
        "onHand": 200,
        "shipped": 20
    },
    "customAttributes": {},
    "networkCounters": {}
}
```

## Importing orders

Before using the `oms-imports` endpoint, you must create a JSON file containing all your order information in a specific format.

The JSON file is used to provide a centralized source for order, inventory, and warehouse information, enabling you to receive, track, and fulfill customer orders.

### Step 1: Create the JSON file containing your orders

Note that each line in the JSON file represents one order. If you want to import 1000 orders , the file should have exactly 1000 lines with each line representing an order object. If you save the JSON file with an extension that makes it more readable or expands the object to more than one line, the upload fails.

<Accordion title="JSON order example">
  This section provides a JSON example that shows a single order object formatted to be readable. The following sample code includes examples of potential custom attributes and is designed to illustrate the best-case scenario, offering a comprehensive order view:

  }
  ```
</Accordion>

### Step 2: Retrieve the `importId` and upload URL

The `oms-imports` endpoint is used to create the `importId` and returns a `uploadFileUrl`. The `uploadFileUrl` is used to upload the JSON file from [step 1](#step-1-create-the-json-file-containing-your-orders).

```Bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.fabric.inc/api/v3/oms-imports' \
--header 'X-Fabric-Tenant-Id: {tenantId}' \
--header 'X-Fabric-Channel-Id: 12' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {authorizationToken}' \
--data '{
    "fileName": "C:/Users/Fabric/Downloads/example_order.json",
    "module": "ORDER",
    "type": "BULK"
}'
```

**Response**:

```Bash
{
    "importId": "6650def0104f907ac98275de",
    "uploadFileUrl": "{AWS S3 Upload URL}",
    "fileName": "example_order.json",
    "module": "ORDER",
    "type": "BULK",
    "statusCode": "INITIATED",
    "createdAt": "2024-05-24T18:39:44Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-05-24T18:39:44Z"
}
```

### Step 3: Upload the JSON file

Use the `uploadFileUrl` value, which is returned in [step 2](#step-2-retrieve-the-importid-and-upload-url), and send a **PUT** request with the template file.

Note: No authorization token is required for this step. If you use Postman, click the URL to automatically open the request in a new tab. Remember to change the request from GET to PUT and in the body of the request click the binary option followed by providing your inventory CSV file.

```Bash
curl --location --request PUT '{AWS S3 upload URL}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '@/C:/Users/Fabric/Downloads/example_order.json'
```

A successful response returns a 200 status.

### Step 4: Check the status of the import

Ensure that you have the `importId` value from the response in [Step 2](#step-2-retrieve-the-importid-and-upload-url).

You can check your order upload status by making a GET request to the `oms-imports/{importId}` endpoint.

**GET Request**:

```Bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.fabric.inc/api/v3/oms-imports/{importId}' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: {tenantId}' \
--header 'x-fabric-channel-id: 12' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {authorizationToken}'
```

**Response**:

Depending on the number of orders being imported, this process can take up to 20 minutes to complete. Batches of up to 1 million imports are supported at a time. The `statusCode` value is set to **INITIATED** until the process completes.

```JSON
{
    "importId": "6670898e85d8c162c403f4d3",
    "fileName": "example_order_2.json",
    "module": "ORDER",
    "type": "BULK",
    "statusCode": "COMPLETED",
    "createdAt": "2024-06-17T19:07:58Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-06-17T19:11:30Z",
    "originalFileUrl": "{AWS S3 Upload URL}"
}
```

### Step 5: Use the order number to retrieve an order

To verify the orders are imported, make a GET request to the `orders/order-number/{orderNumber}` endpoint using one of the imported order numbers.

**Request**:

```BASH
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.fabric.inc/api/v3/orders/order-number/{orderNumber}' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: {tenantId}' \
--header 'x-fabric-channel-id: 12' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {authorizationToken}'
```

A successful response returns a 200 status with an order object in the payload.

# Order Exchange
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/order-exchange



Using the exchange functionality of fabric's Orders service, the Customer Service Representatives (CSR) can exchange an order item. Exchange is essentially `a return + a new item shipment`, and this phase integrates the *returns service* with the *exchange service*.

**General Rules:**

* Exchange functionality doesn't have a separate endpoint, and uses the return service for performing order exchanges.
* Exchange for an item is identified by the `exchange` `boolean` field on the return payload.
* For an exchange, if the item can't be shipped due to being out of stock, but the item returned for the exchange is processed, then the amount for the returned line items must be refunded.
* Refunding and payment due to the price difference between the original and replacement items aren't handled by the returns or exchange service. This information must be sent by the requester during the pending return flow.

**Workflow:**

The exchange functionality has two flows:

* [Exchange items are shipped when the return is received](#exchange-items-are-shipped-when-the-return-is-received)
* [Exchange items are shipped irrespective of the item being received](#exchange-items-are-shipped-irrespective-of-the-item-being-received)

### Exchange items are shipped when the return is received

* The `returnType` parameter is set to ` Received`
* The `exchange` parameter is set to `true`
* The `initiateReshipment` parameter is set to `true` for items
* The returns service gets a “PENDING” return request flagged as an exchange.
* The returns service notifies the exchange service about the exchange.
* The exchange service broadcasts that the exchange is pending.
* The returns service gets a “RECEIVED” return request.
* The exchange service updates the order document by changing the status of the replacement item to be shipped.
* The exchange service broadcasts that the exchange is sent to the Shipment service.
* Allocation service handles inventory updates and shipping.
* If the client POSTs the return received, then:
  * ship the new item
  * disable refunding for the original item
* If the client initiates an exchange for a *pending return*, then the network inventory is reserved at the time the exchange is created. From there, fabric OMS awaits until the item `returnType` “RECEIVED” is posted by the client. If the client receives the item to be returned then,
  * ship the new item
  * disable refunding for the original item

### Exchange items are shipped irrespective of the item being received

* Exchange for an item is identified by the `exchange` boolean field on the return payload.
* The requester sets `initiateReshipment` to `true` at the first moment of the exchange, indicating the immediate shipping of the replacement item regardless of the return status (received or pending). In this case, the allocation service will be triggered at the end of the pending return flow.
* The administrator ships the new item without the distribution center receiving the item and disables refunding for the original item.

# Order Fulfillment
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/order-fulfillment



fabric’s Orders service simplifies complex order management and fulfillment processes after an order is created either by using any checkout service or at the Point of Sale (POS).

With fabric's Orders service, merchants can:

* Create a unified commerce experience by importing all orders in real time to a single application.
* Cancel, return, and exchange orders.
* Handle tasks such as invoicing, shipment tracking, backorders, and other use cases.
* Use the endpoints to create orders, initiate post-order process workflows, and manage order-related data, such as setting the estimated delivery date and ship-by date. Additionally, merchants can set fulfillment location information to view what facility orders were allocated for the fulfillment.

### Workflow

The following provides a basic workflow of fabric's Orders service for the orders created using a checkout service:

1. Merchants create an Order and upload details to fabric's Orders service after shoppers complete the payment process at the checkout stage.
2. fabric Orders sends a notification for different order updates, using the Notification APIs, to shoppers and merchants.
3. fabric Orders allocates the order, using allocation APIs, to the shopper's nearest warehouse or facility for inventory confirmation, and shipping of the product.
4. Order is then picked, packed, and shipped.
5. Merchant and shopper are notified of the delivery being shipped.
6. The order is completed when it reaches the shopper’s delivery address.

### Set up Order Tracking for an Order Created Using a Checkout Service

After an order is created, for the order to drop to the warehouse, merchants must set up webhook subscriptions to fabric's Orders events for better order management.

* [Workflow](#workflow)
* [Set up Order Tracking for an Order Created Using a Checkout Service](#set-up-order-tracking-for-an-order-created-using-a-checkout-service)
  * [Step 1: Set up a webhook subscription to OMS events](#step-1-set-up-a-webhook-subscription-to-oms-events)
  * [Step 2: Create an Order and Upload it to fabric OMS](#step-2-create-an-order-and-upload-it-to-fabric-oms)
  * [Step 3: Integrate OMS with Warehouse Management System (WMS)](#step-3-integrate-oms-with-warehouse-management-system-wms)
  * [Step 4: Integrate OMS with Fraud Service](#step-4-integrate-oms-with-fraud-service)
  * [Step 5: Create Shipment for the Allocations](#step-5-create-shipment-for-the-allocations)
  * [Optional Steps:](#optional-steps)

#### Step 1: Set up a webhook subscription to OMS events

1. Use webhook endpoint (`POST/v3/oms-webhooks`) to set up webhook subscriptions to [various order events](/v3/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/list-of-webhook-events#order-service) so that when an order is created or updated, fabric OMS automatically starts the post-order processes, and sends notifications for the subscribed events.
2. Once an order is allocated to a warehouse, the webhook that you have configured, sends a notification mentioning an allocation ID.

Following is a **curl example** for subscribing to allocation events:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/oms-webhooks' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
--header 'x-site-context: {"account":"63310842f37ee100111e9fe3"}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "target": "https://webhook.site/83834d4c-9736-4cba-b32b-e6b6d75a6683",
    "protocol": "HTTP",
    "source": "ORDER_SERVICE", // This will change based on service to be subscribed
    "apiVersion": "1.0.0",
    "format": "application/json",
    "requestType": "POST",
    "events": [
        "ORDER_CREATE"
        "ORDER_SHIPPED" // List of events to subscribe
    ]
}'
```

To subscribe to any other events of fabric Orders, mention the respective source name and events that you want to subscribe for. For details, see [List of Webhook Events](/v3/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/list-of-webhook-events#order-service).

#### Step 2: Create an Order and Upload it to fabric OMS

Use the `POST/v3/orders` endpoint to create an order through any integrated checkout service that you are using.

* The `orderNumber` field that's passed during order creation is a string.
* For Cash On Delivery (COD) orders, provide `paymentMethod` as ‘CASH\_ON\_DELIVERY’, and `chargedAmount` as ‘0’ under the payment object while creating an order.

#### Step 3: Integrate fabric OMS with Warehouse Management System (WMS)

Integrate fabric OMS with the WMS that you use to check the movement of inventory to fulfill orders. By integrating OMS with WMS, you allow the WMS to listen to allocation events that you created in the first step. Based on the shopper's location, fabric OMS allocates orders to the nearest warehouse. To integrate OMS with the WMS you use, either:

1. You (retailers) develop the integration software to communicate with fabric OMS, and maintain the integration layer on your own.
2. Or, you (retailers) use a third-party integration software that's developed to communicate with fabric OMS. For example, Bascom develops integration software for fabric OMS.

#### Step 4: Integrate OMS with Fraud Service

Use fraud endpoints to integrate OMS with Fraud service

#### Step 5: Create Shipment for the Allocations

Configure integration service with fabric OMS in such a way that integration service uses the create shipment endpoint (POST/v3/allocations/search) to ship the order to the shopper's address after a warehouse is allocated with order details.

#### Optional Steps:

Search [orders](/v3/api-reference/orders/orders/find-orders) or [allocation](/v3/api-reference/orders/allocations/search-for-allocations-by-query) for additional information.

**Get Allocations by orderId**

You can get allocations by orderId using the [POST/v3/allocations/search](/v3/api-reference/orders/allocations/search-for-allocations-by-query) endpoint.

**curl example:**

```JSON
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/allocations/search?offset=0&limit=10' \
--header 'Authorization: {{accessToken}}' \
--header 'x-site-context: {"account":"63310842f37ee100111e9fe3"}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '
    {
  "sort": "-allocation.createdAt",
  "filters": [
    {
      "field": "allocation.items.orderId",
      "value": "Order_*",
      "condition": "EQ"
    },
    {
      "field": "allocation.items.itemId",
      "value": [
        "Item_1122",
        "Item_2233"
      ],
      "condition": "IN"
    }
  ]
}'
```

**Search Order allocation by allocationId**

Use the [`GET/allocations/{allocationId}`](/v3/api-reference/orders/allocations/get-allocation-by-id) endpoint to get order allocation details by `allocationId`.


# Order Return
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/order-return



An order or portion of an order is eligible for return if:

* It's fulfilled.
* The items to be returned aren't previously returned.
* The item’s `eligible` property is set to `false` in [check order return eligibility](/v3/api-reference/orders/returns/order-return-by-order-number) API response.
* The item aligns with fabric's return policy.

**General Rules:**

* Return for an item is identified by the `exchange` boolean (`exchange` is set to `false`) field on the [return payload](/v3/api-reference/orders/returns/order-return-by-order-number).
* Return for an order is validated for eligibility based on the orderId and lineItemId.
* Charged amount in the [payments object](/v3/api-reference/orders/orders/create-new-order) of the order document shouldn't be null to process the refund.
* Use the [`POST/v3/orders/{orderId}/actions/submit-return-request`](/v3/api-reference/orders/returns/order-return-by-order-id) endpoint to initiate order return by order ID.
* You can also use the [`POST/v3/orders/order-number/{orderNumber}/actions/submit-return-request`](/v3/api-reference/orders/returns/order-return-by-order-number) endpoint to initiate order return by order number.
* Order status should be one of: `ORDER_DELIVERED`, `ORDER_SHIPPED`, `ORDER_PARTIALLY_SHIPPED`, `ORDER_PARTIALLY_DELIVERED`, `ORDER_PARTIALLY_RETURNED`,\
  `ORDER_PARTIALLY_CANCELLED`, `PICKUP_COMPLETE`.
* The `lineOrderStatus` should be one of: `PENDING_EXCHANGE`, `RETURN_PROCESSING`, `PARTIALLY_CANCELLED`, `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`,`PARTIALLY_CANCELLED_REFUNDED`,`VALID`, `PENDING_RETURN`, `ORDER_LINE_VALID`, `SHIPPED`, `PARTIALLY_SHIPPED`, `PARTIALLY_ALLOCATED`, `DELIVERED`, `PARTIALLY_DELIVERED`, `PARTIAL_RETURN`.
* [Initiate a return when an item is pending to be received at the distribution center](#initiate-a-return-request-when-an-item-is-pending-to-be-received-at-the-distribution-center)
  * [Item reaches the distribution center and is processed for return](#item-reaches-the-distribution-center-and-is-processed-for-return-or-reject)
* [Create a return when the item is received at the distribution center for return](#create-a-return-when-an-item-is-received-or-accepted-for-return)

### Initiate a return request when an item is pending to be received at the distribution center

When a shopper or a customer service agent creates a return request, but the item isn't received at the distribution center:

1. Set `returnType` to `PENDING` in the request payload while using the `POST/v3/orders/{orderId}/actions/submit-return-request` endpoint to create a return.

* `lineOrderStatus` will be updated to `RETURN_PENDING` for the line item of an order ID. Merchants can get the order details, along with the order status, by calling the `GET/v3/orders/{orderId}` endpoint.
* `RETURN_PENDING` webhook event is triggered if the merchant has subscribed to the event. The target URL of the subscription payload is notified.

#### Item reaches the distribution center and is processed for return or reject

* When an item reaches the distribution center, use the `POST/v3/orders/{orderId}/actions/submit-return-request` endpoint to set `returnType` to `PROCESSING` in the request payload.
* `lineOrderStatus` will be updated to `RETURN_PROCESSING` for the line item of the order ID. You can get the order details, along with the order status, by calling the `GET/v3/orders/{orderId}` endpoint.
* At this stage, the customer service agent at the warehouse or the distribution center does the quality checks such as, if the item is in good condition to return if the item matches the original order, etc. After a thorough inspection, the CSR can accept or reject the return request.
* `RETURN_PROCESSING` webhook event is triggered if the merchant has subscribed to the event. The target URL of the subscription payload is notified about the event.

### Create a return when an item is received or accepted for return

* Use `POST/v3/orders/{orderId}/actions/submit-return-request` endpoint, and set `returnType` to `received`.
* The amount received for return will be validated based on the invoiced amount for the item. If validation fails for any reason, an error message will be returned.
* If a refund for returned item is successful, the response for the order return endpoint (POST/api/v2/order/return) will display `refundStatus` as `SUCCESSFUL`.
* If all the quantity of line items are returned:
  * `lineOrderStatus` (return status at item level) will be updated to `RETURNED`.
  * `statusCode` (return status at order level) will be updated to `ORDER_RETURNED`.
* If some of the quantities of line items are returned:
  * `lineOrderStatus` (return status at item level) will be updated to `PARTIALLY_RETURNED`.
  * `statusCode` (return status at order level) will be updated to `ORDER_PARTIALLY_RETURNED`.
* If the refund failed for any reason, the response for the order return endpoint (POST/api/v2/order/return) will display `refundStatus` as `REFUND_FAILED`.
* `RETURN_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` and `REFUND_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` webhook events are triggered if the merchant has subscribed to the events, and details are sent to the merchant.

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/overview



fabric's Order Management System (OMS), also referred to as fabric Orders, is a distributed order management (DOM) platform that helps retailers manage the order fulfillment process and provide inventory details, order fulfillment, and customer service. As retailers, not only can you receive, track, and fulfill customer orders across sales channels, you can allow customers to track their orders, route orders through warehouses based on the customer’s location, and more.

This document provides details related to inventory creation, management, rules to configure inventory that suits your business needs, order orchestration, order exchange logic, and more information about fabric's Orders service.

**Note:** In this document, the terms 'fabric Orders' and 'fabric OMS' are used interchangeably.

### Workflow

The following workflow diagram illustrates how fabric's Order Management System (also called fabric Orders) works:

![OMS Workflow Diagram](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fabric-demo/images/oms-workflow-diagram.jpg)

### Getting Started

fabric's Orders service supports modern distributed commerce models, including buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS), ship-to-store (for store pick up or replenishment), and store fulfillment (as mini distribution centers) models. It not only offers network aggregation for enterprise-level inventory visibility but also enables retailers to modify order fulfillment logic without the need for coding, thereby reducing the burden on developer resources.

### Core Concepts

fabric OMS consists of two independent data orchestration modules: **Inventory** and **Orders**. The following are some of the other core concepts that are used while creating or updating inventory:

#### Location

Create a location, using [location APIs](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/locations/overview), for which you want to create an inventory or update inventory. You must provide a unique location number while creating a location. Use this location number to manage inventory.

You can also create custom location attributes for a location by location number while creating or updating inventories. The following are two examples of location attributes:

* BOPIS- to enable buy online and pick up in-store policy for a specific location.
* Return- to enable inventory return policy for a warehouse in a specific location.

#### Inventory

Inventory refers to the goods and products for sale. Inventory endpoints let you:

* Bulk import inventory from other sources to fabric OMS using the bulk import feature in Copilot or using the bulk import endpoint.
* Create or update inventory records, set up inventory availability rules, and set inventory quantities (using the counter object) to display an accurate available-to-purchase quantity using the Copilot UI or by using API. See Create Inventory section for more information.
* You can query the inventory of a specific item (by itemId), and in a specific region by SKU and postal code.

For details, refer to the [Inventory](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/locations/overview) endpoints.

#### Network

A Network is a group of locations that share inventory. Using [network APIs](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/networks/delete-network-by-code), you can create custom networks (for example, ‘shipToHome’) to manage inventory within a specified set of locations. Use network endpoints to aggregate the quantity of the SKU in the “On Hand” and “Reserved” counter for a specified set of locations (warehouses or stores). You can specify “Safety Stock” inventory values for a network.

#### Counter

Counter refers to the position of the inventory, such as on-hand, allocated, shipped, etc. Using counter APIs, you can create any custom counter to suit your business needs. As per the on-hand counter quantity you pass in the request body while creating or updating inventory, `availableToPurchase` virtual-counter quantity is calculated based on the formula `onHand - allocated - shipped`. If you create a custom counter and mention it while creating or updating inventory, those custom counter quantities are also subtracted to calculate the `availableToPurchase` virtual counter quantity.

From the left-side navigation pane, refer to *Orders > Developer Guide > Inventory Setup > Rules for Updating Counter Quantity* for more information on how to use counters while creating or updating inventory.

#### Virtual Counter

Virtual Counter refers to the inventory quantity that's available to sell by calculating the difference between available inventory and reserved for-purchase inventory. It helps prevent over-promising of inventory by subtracting the reserved-for-purchase inventory count from the in-warehouse inventory count.

Use the “availableToPurchase” virtual counter with the formula `On Hand - Reserved - Backordered - Ordered - Acknowledged - Safety Stock` so that the virtual counter returns your physical inventory minus the reserved quantity.

### Inventory Features

The inventory module of fabric OMS lets merchants:

* Bulk imports inventory from all external sources of truth such as Warehouse Management System (WMS), Inventory Management System (IMS), or any other Point of Sale (POS).
* Get the real-time quantity that's readily available to sell.
* Create a network (group of locations) to aggregate inventory at different locations for a group of SKUs.
* Create location attributes, such as `isReturn` (indicates if the location supports the return of sold items) or BOPIS (indicates if shoppers can buy the item online and pick it up in-store). These attributes represent inventory availability at a location level for omnichannel use cases.
* Create safety stock to prevent overselling.
* Flag stock levels of the item on the Product Description Page (PDP).
* Set a backorder date that indicates the expected date of restocking.
* Set a pre-order date that indicates the expected product launch date.

### Order Features

Using fabric's Orders service, merchants can:

* Integrate the order creation with any external 3rd party checkout service or POS.
* Validate the order using integrated product and fraud services. Uses fraud endpoints to validate orders.
* Automatically reserve products for the created order, and decrements inventory as orders are updated.
* Allocate orders to locations (warehouses) that are nearest to the customer location.
* Allocate orders to facilities in the order of the assigned facility rank.
* Check if the order is a gift card or donation type, based on how merchants configure orders during the order creation.
* Create shipment using POST `/api/v3/shipments` endpoint to write split allocations into distributed records for each parcel fulfilling the order.
* Create invoices related to shipments capturing the payment at the time of order shipment and recording the transaction details.
* Cancel orders to release the payment intent authorization for order lines in eligible statuses.
* Return the order and refund the payment capture for order lines that are returned, excluding fees and shipment.
* Create order appeasements, by manually refunding an arbitrary amount less than the captured amount per order line.
* Exchange orders, by creating a zero-dollar order for a sku variant related to the return of an order line.
* Audit Trails, by recording all actions (updates) on each of the 4 records- order, allocation, shipment, and invoice.
* Set up webhooks, by subscribing to event types for third-party workflow triggering.
* Create notifications, by triggering 18 different customer notification event types from order events.
* Track packages, by posting updates from shipment tracking services to fabric OMS.

### Using fabric OMS

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Generate Authorization Token](#generate-authorization-token)

#### Prerequisites

1. **Authorization token:** You must provide an access token while making an API request. fabric OMS supports both Identity v1 and Identity v2 approaches to getting access tokens. See the [Generate Authorization Token](#generateauthtoken) section to generate an authorization token using Copilot.
2. **Product data(optional):** You must provide product details if you are using a 3rd party product management system other than fabric’s Product Catalog, also referred to as fabric Product Catalog. fabric OMS needs product details such as name, description, image, and other related details for which you want to create inventory.
3. **Inventory data:** You must provide sku, itemId, location, channelId, and counters indicating factual quantities of products across all locations. Location includes physical stores, warehouses, in transit, and any third-party suppliers.

#### Generate Authorization Token

To generate an authorization token:

1. Log in to Copilot with your fabric credentials.
2. Navigate to Orders.
3. Right-click, and then click **Inspect**.
4. Navigate to the **Application** tab.
5. Under **Session Storage**, click the Copilot URL and find a value for `accessToken`.
6. This `accessToken` value is the authorization token you must use while calling fabric Offers APIs.

**curl example:**

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/locations' \
--header 'x-site-context: {"date":"2021-11-11T21:48:47.769Z","channel":12,"account":"5f689caa4216e7000750d1ef","stage":"stg02"}' \
--header 'Authorization: eyJraWQiOiItOWxOcTZVcmR3bl9tNFJ2bDd1a2RMN0NUOUNndXIya3VJXzNjUnhnaG…' \
--data-raw ‘’

```

**Note:** In the above example, `account` refers to the Copilot account ID.

Orders Support: [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new) | URL: [https://www.fabric.inc](https://www.fabric.inc) | License: [fabric API License](https://fabric.inc/api-license)

fabric Orders enable you to receive, track, and fulfill customer orders across sales channels, allow customers to track their orders, route orders through warehouses based on the customer’s location, and more.

Orders is designed to streamline and simplify order management and fulfillment processes during and after an order is created.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

fabric Copilot provides the ability to restrict the access of different users to information and actions available to them through roles. For more information and instructions on how to set up these controls, see the [RBAC](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) documentation.

## Integration Examples

**Allocation with fabric Orders:** After creating an order using fabric Orders service, the orders service sends a request to fabric’s Allocation module for order allocation. Allocation calls Order Fulfillment Logic (OFL) and OFL rules to get the location number where the inventory is available based on the currently defined OFL rule system. After completion, OFL provides the necessary information to the Allocation service, and Allocation calls the inventory service to reserve items as needed, adjusting your inventory counters in real-time.

The Order fulfillment process is set up by integrating your existing fulfillment systems, such as a Warehouse Management System (WMS), with fabric's Allocation APIs. This integration enables allocation-related events to start fulfillments in external systems, and allows external systems to make callbacks to the fabric Allocation APIs.

**Shipments & Tracking with fabric Orders:** fabric's Shipment APIs ensure that shipments are created for allocations. These APIs enable the warehouse or any external fulfillment system to generate shipments associated with the allocated orders.

Additionally, you can set up shipment tracking updates for orders by integrating your carrier tracking service with the Shipment Tracking APIs. These APIs enable the external carrier tracking service, such as ParcelLab, to post shipment events. With the order created, shipped, and tracking enabled, you can manage the order. This includes Cancellations, Appeasements, Exchanges, Credits, Returns, and more using the Orders APIs or [Manage Orders in Copilot](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-management/overview) UI as needed.

**Notifications with fabric Orders:** Optionally, you can configure email updates for order transactions by integrating your preferred email service with the Notification APIs. This integration enables fabric Orders to deliver real-time email notifications for specific order update events.

**Fraud with fabric Orders:** To establish fraud prevention, you can integrate your preferred fraud service with the Fraud APIs. These APIs primarily allow for hold and release actions on the order, providing an effective means of preventing fraudulent activities.

## Benefits

* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**: Manage the customer lifetime vale through omnichannel orders. With all your data in one place, improve customer service by reducing call volume, average handle time, and increase support satisfaction. Improve order orchestration by reducing split shipments, OOS cancellations, and increasing on time delivery rate. As a multi-brand and multi-channel retailer, improve order processing time, reduce inventory cancellations, and subsequently increase support satisfaction.

* **Sell-through Rate (STR)**: You can increase sell-through rate by unifying and improving the Buy Online and Pickup in Store (BOPIS) experience, ship from store experience, and improved store inventory management.

* **Storefront Conversion Rate (CVR)**: Using real-time inventory coupled with backorder and preorder capabilities, you can increase sell-through rate, website conversion, and site merchandiser operational efficiency. Additionally, you can optimize your inventory and fulfillment by reducing split shipments, OOS cancellations, and increasing on time delivery rate.

## Example Use Cases

* **Exporting Sales and Reports Data**: Using fabric Orders export API, you can export data to be utilized for business intelligence or store the data externally as needed. The exports service flattens the JSON structure into columns, so that an external columnar database, such as an SQL database, can easily ingest the data. Exports can also be generated in fabric Copilot for ad-hoc analysis.

* **Fulfilling Backorders & Preorders**: During the order creation process within fabric Orders service, backorders and preorders are identified and flagged accordingly. This enables the backorder and preorder service to store these orders in a dedicated backorder queue. Fulfillment of these orders follows a *first in, first out* approach as inventory becomes available for the backorders.

  Additionally, consent to delay operations are implemented based on your configuration of backorder settings. Orders that exceed the specified backorder service level require customer consent to proceed with the delay. fabric triggers the consent to delay notification based on your configuration, and updates regarding consent to delay are managed through the consent to delay API endpoint.

* **Omnichannel Store Fulfillment**: You can maximize return on existing investments in physical locations, such as brick and mortar stores, by connecting ecommerce sales to store inventories that are eligible for direct-to-consumer shipments. By bringing store inventory into the fulfillment network, you can expand capacity for ecommerce sales and increase the available assortment for online shoppers.

* **Optimized Order Fulfillment Logic**: Using fabric's Order Fulfillment Logic (OFL) you can configure how orders are handled for different items, locations, sales, shipping types, and more. For example, multi-location fulfillment allows you to allocate orders to specific fulfillment locations based on factors, such as shipping type, geographic distance, and inventory availability. This flexibility enables efficient order processing and reduces shipping times. For same-day delivery optimization, fabric's geolocation feature can be utilized. It considers the customer's location and searches for inventory networks within a set distance that can fulfill the order the fastest. This feature can be configured with specific boundaries and inventory balancing options to ensure the fastest possible delivery. Split shipment management is another key feature, allowing orders to be fulfilled from multiple locations when necessary. This can be set up at both the order and item level, with options to allow partial fulfillment. This functionality is particularly useful when dealing with complex inventory situations or when aiming to optimize delivery times for multi-item orders.

# Orders FAQ
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/orders-faq-s



#### How can I insert fees, discounts, and taxes at the order level and item level?

* To insert fees, discounts, and taxes at item level, include the details in the `_items_ array` while creating an order.
* To insert fees, discounts, and taxes at order level, include the details outside the *items* array while creating an order. For details, see the request payload of [Order Create](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/orders/create-new-order).

#### How does the fabric Orders module manage customer data security and privacy?

fabric’s REST APIs are protected with OpenID Connect (OIDC) along with the identity introspector mechanism. In OIDC, identity information is communicated using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The data in fabric is stored in both MongoDB and S3. The MongoDB data is isolated per tenant in fabric Orders (also called OMS).

You must create an [AWS configuration rule](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-aws-config-to-monitor-for-and-respond-to-amazon-s3-buckets-allowing-public-access/) to ensure that the AWS S3 Bucket doesn't have public access. For example, one shouldn't be able to run:

```shell
curl https://inventory-oms-refresher-prod01.s3.amazonaws.com/chicosprod/export/store/FabricStoreInventorySync%5FCHO%5F2023-06-15T08-31-00-827090592Z.csv
```

Whenever data is requested, fabric will generate a S3 presigned URL to ensure secure access.

#### What's the primary use case of the fabric Orders service?

The fabric Order service is designed to streamline and simplify order management and fulfillment processes during and after an order is created either by using a checkout service or at the Point of Sale (POS). It contains features to simplify advanced configurations in addition to the standard post order operations and fulfillment workflow rules engine capabilities common to the functionalities and jobs supported by most Enterprise Order Management and Distributed Order Management Systems.

#### What are the key features of the fabric Orders module?

Backorder and Preorder, simplified configuration interfaces for setting post order validation and customer service policies, Customer Service and Returns Management operational interfaces, Digital Security and Role based access, Dropship integration and fulfillment, Incident Management, Fulfillment Rule Setting.

#### How can I get started with the fabric Orders module?

If you are using fabric Orders with fabric Store Fulfillment and fabric Inventory, you can start creating orders using the [order create endpoint](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/orders/create-new-order) after inventory is set up. Alternatively, you can disable inventory reservation for order fulfillment by contacting [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new).

#### How does fabric Orders (also called OMS) handle the order fulfillment process?

Once order is created using fabric Orders service, it sends request to fabric’s Allocation module for order allocation, then Allocation calls Order Fulfillment Logic (OFL), OFL rules get the location number where the inventory is available, and responds back to Allocation, and Allocation calls inventory to reserved items for the location number received from OFL.

Order fulfillment process is set up by integrating your existing fulfillment systems, such as the Warehouse Management System (WMS), with the Allocation APIs of the fabric Orders module. This integration enables allocation-related events to start fulfillments in external systems, and it allows external systems to make callbacks to the fabric Allocation APIs.

Shipment APIs ensure that shipments are created for allocations. These APIs enable the warehouse or any external fulfillment system to generate shipments associated with the allocated orders.

You can establish the configuration for transactional email updates regarding orders by integrating your preferred email service with the Notification APIs of the fabric Orders module. This integration enables fabric Orders to start real-time email notifications for specific order update events.

To establish fraud prevention of orders, you can integrate your preferred fraud service with the Fraud APIs of fabric’s Order module. These APIs primarily allow for hold and release actions on the order, providing an effective means of preventing fraudulent activities.

You can set up shipment tracking updates for orders by integrating your carrier tracking service with the Shipment Tracking APIs of fabric’s Orders module. These APIs enable the external carrier tracking service, such as ParcelLab, to post shipment events.

#### Can fabric Orders handle orders from multiple channels?

Yes, the order create API can be integrated with systems such as web storefront, POS, and other sales channels. This integration enables the posting of orders to a centralized application database, ensuring a single source of truth for all orders.

When dealing with multi-brand orders that require separation of customer service and operational workflows, the `channel` field in the `order.channel` and `order.items.channel` JSON objects allows creating orders with separate groupings.

#### How does fabric’s Orders service manage returns and exchanges?

When processing returns using fabric’s Orders module, the result can be either a pending return for tracking purposes or an immediate completion of the return process for the order.

An order or items of an order are eligible for return if:

1. It has been fulfilled
2. The items to be returned haven't been previously returned
3. The item's eligible property isn't set to false in the check order return eligibility API response, which is configured using the Return Policies interface.

Return requests can be initiated using either the order ID or the order number as identification. The response object specifies refund amount, return fees to subtract from the refund, and reason codes for the return. If a refund for a returned item is successful, the response for the order return endpoint will display `refundStatus` as SUCCESSFUL. If the refund fails for any reason, the response for the order return endpoint will display `refundStatus` as REFUND\_FAILED. Order details can be accessed by calling the [return endpoints](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/returns/overview).

Exchange requests within fabric are initiated using the same [return endpoints](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/returns/overview) provided that the `isExchange` flag must be set to `true`.

#### How does fabric’s Orders module handle payment processing?

fabric Orders module can either be used to orchestrate payment operations, or payments can be disabled for the system. This is currently only configured by fabric Support during the onboarding process.

#### How does fabric’s Orders module manage tax calculations for different regions?

fabric Orders doesn't manage tax calculation. Taxes must be calculated by the client by using tax calculation services external to fabric, during update operations to the order.

#### Can I customize the interface and workflows within fabric’s Orders module to fit my business needs?

Yes, fabric provides the flexibility to customize the interface and workflows to support your business needs. An use case is creation of an order after shoppers complete the checkout process involves minimal data validation.

* You can configure data validation settings in the [attributes interface](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/order-attributes), so that orders with invalid attributes or values can be flagged immediately after order placement.
* You can also configure the validation process for post-order updates, such as returns, exchanges, cancellations, appeasements, and pickups, using Policies in Copilot. This enables you to obtain eligibility information for these operations on a per-order basis and customize the workflow associated with these operations.\
  **Note:** For information on the process of returning and canceling orders, refer to the guide that explains [canceling SKUs](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-management/cancel-skus) and the Orders [Cancellation API](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/cancellations/overview).
* You can manage backorder fulfillment settings such as the consent to delay workflow using the [backorder settings API](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/backorders-preorders/overview).
* Setting up integrations using the webhooks and integration-related APIs enables the notification of various order updates to shoppers, efficient allocation of orders to the most suitable warehouse or facility for inventory confirmation and product shipping, as well as the provision of shipment tracking updates.

#### How does fabric’s Orders module support my customer service team?

fabric’s customer service operations can be used either in the Copilot interface or within your existing customer service and relationship management application. fabric Orders doesn't currently offer native support for case management. However, retailers using a customer service application can choose to use fabric Copilot alongside their existing customer service application, or embed fabric Orders APIs for handling cancellations, returns, exchanges, appeasements, and other supported order updates directly within their CSR application.

#### Does fabric’s Orders module help generate sales and performance reports?

Yes, you can perform export operations using the export API, which can be utilized through integration for business intelligence and storing the data in external data warehouses. The exports service flattens the JSON structure into columns such that an external columnar database such as an SQL database can ingest the data. Exports can also be generated using Copilot for ad-hoc analysis.

#### How does fabric’s Orders module handle international orders and shipping?

fabric Orders module includes the Crossborder API with basic hold and release functions for your external applications to manage the crossborder fulfillment process. The fabric databases also support all UTF-8 languages and support ISO 4217 currency codes during order create and update operations. These currencies and languages will reflect in any read operation through API or Copilot. There are no additional international order functions than these.

#### How's customer information stored and managed in the fabric Orders module?

Customer information is stored within the order JSON, and any bulk updates to customer data must be performed using the standard order update functions. The fabric Orders module doesn't maintain customer data in a separate collection. Additionally, a customer [edit API](/v3/platform/api-reference/customers/customer-self/overview) is available for client web applications, simplifying the process of updating customer data within orders.

#### Does fabric’s Orders module support order migration from my existing platform?

Yes, fabric Orders provides a set of [import APIs](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/developer-guide/order-and-inventory-import) to manage the order import process, primarily to support post-order operations on orders that may be required after transition from your current order services to fabric Orders.

#### How does fabric’s Orders module manage backorders and preorders?

During the order creation process within fabric Orders, backorders and preorders are identified and flagged accordingly. This enables the Backorder and Preorder service to store these orders in a dedicated backorder queue. Fulfillment of these orders follows a "first in, first out" approach as inventory becomes available for the backorders.

Additionally, consent to delay operations are implemented based on the configuration of backorder settings. Orders that exceed the specified backorder service level require customer consent to proceed with the delay. fabric triggers the consent to delay notification based on the merchant's configuration, and updates regarding consent to delay are managed through the consent to delay endpoint.

#### How does the fabric Orders module integrate with fabric Inventory?

By default, fabric Orders is designed to seamlessly integrate with fabric Inventory module for new users. Users of both modules get the advantage of real time updates ensuring that inventory availability is automatically updated as orders are fulfilled.

fabric provides the flexibility to its customers to disable fabric Orders and use fabric Inventory as a standalone module, as well as disable fabric Inventory and use fabric Orders as a standalone module. To disable or re-enable a module, please contact [fabric Support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new).

The benefits of using modules independently are primarily for the purpose of implementing the strangler pattern, where the transition process occurs gradually on a service-by-service basis.

# Orders & Inventory
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/homepage



With fabric Orders, you can receive, track, and fulfill customer orders across sales channels and enable customers to track their orders.

Order fulfillment logic allows you to create fulfillment rules that route orders through different fulfillment locations based on characteristics such as customer location, warehouse location, item price, order attribute type, and more.

Orders and Inventory are accessible through fabric’s cloud-based application [Copilot](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/overview), or through fabric's [Order APIs](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders) and [Inventory APIs](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory).

## Use Case

As a retailer today, its no secret that you might be struggling with rising order fulfillment and shipping costs due to the complexities of modern fulfillment networks. Many retailers find that existing systems struggle to handle the intricacies of split shipments, geo-location based fulfillment, and custom item rules. This often leads to increased costs and the need for time-consuming, expensive custom rulesets.

Using fabric's Order Fulfillment Logic (OFL) you can configure how orders are handled for different items, locations, sales, shipping types, and any other custom defined attributes.

For example, multi-location fulfillment allows you to allocate orders to specific fulfillment locations based on factors such as shipping type, geographic distance, and inventory availability. This flexibility enables efficient order processing and reduces shipping times.

For same-day delivery optimization, the geolocation considers the customer's location and searches for inventory networks within a set distance that can fulfill the order the fastest. This feature can be configured with specific boundaries and inventory balancing options to ensure the fastest possible delivery.

Split shipment management is another key feature, allowing orders to be fulfilled from multiple locations when necessary. This can be set up at both the order and item level, with options to allow partial fulfillment. This functionality is particularly useful when dealing with complex inventory situations or when aiming to optimize delivery times for multi-item orders.

# Create a Network
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/inventory/create-a-network



This topic covers the process for creating a new network used to fulfill orders and sort inventory.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Administrator** privileges to fabric Orders. For more information, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.

## Creating a Network

1. In the left menu, click **Inventory** > **Networks**.

   The **Manage Networks** page is displayed.

2. Click **Create Network**.

   The **Create Network** page is displayed.

### Adding basic information

1. In the **Network Name** field, enter a name.

   fabric suggests that you provide a descriptive and unique name for each network. For example, *NA Fulfillment STH Network*.

2. (Optional) In the **Description** field, provide a description.

3. In the **Select type of Network** field, select one of the following:

   * [Single Network](#creating-a-single-network): To create conditional rules, products, and locations for an individual network.
   * [Multiple Networks](#creating-a-new-multi-network): To group existing networks together to form a new network.

### Creating a single network

In the **Setup your Rules** section, you must create rules. These rules are used to match items and locations to a network.

1. In the **Attribute type** field, select one of the following:

   * **Product**: Applies rules that search for product attributes in your product catalog and adds matching products to your network.
   * **Location**:  Applies rules that search for locations based on the defined location attributes and adds matching locations to your network.

2. In the **Attribute name** field, select an attribute name.

3. In the **Contains** field, select a condition.

4. In the **Add Value** field, enter an attribute value.

   To add values, type the value and press enter. Multiple values are supported.

For example, if you want to add only *North America* locations to a network, you can select the **Attribute type** `Location` to add locations to your network. To filter what locations are going to be added, select an **Attribute name** such as `channelId` with the operator `Contains`, and the value `NA`. This adds any locations with a `channelId` containing `NA` to the network.

1. (Optional) You can add an additional rule condition by clicking **Add condition**. This condition is an **AND** condition. To add an **OR** condition, click **Add Rule**.

2. In the **Add Inventory Availability** section, use the **Safety Stock Quantity** field to enter the number of units you want to reserve.

   Safety stock is a quantity of inventory kept on hand to protect against uncertainties in demand or supply. The actual safety stock for a network is the sum of the network-level safety stock plus the aggregated safety stock for every location in the network.

The low stock level field is used to trigger alerts or actions when inventory for a product or in a location falls below the specified threshold. This prevent stockouts and helps maintain optimal inventory levels.

1. In the **Define low stock level** section, enter the number of units to trigger a low stock alert.

### Creating a new multi network

The **Multiple Networks** option allows you to add multiple **Single Networks** together to form a new network. For example, if you recently expanded to ship international, you can differentiate North America, Asia, Europe and other continents by combining them into a new network. This network can then be referenced during inventory and order fulfillment instead of needing to individually list each single network.

1. In the **Single Network** field, select a network.

2. Click **Add**.

   The network is added to the table. Continue to add networks as needed.

<Note> If you want to edit a network's **Safety Stock** or **Low Stock** levels, you must select the network from the **Manage Networks** page and edit it. Editing a **Single Network** that's apart of **Multiple Networks** will update its settings and rules across networks. </Note>


# Creating a Location
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/inventory/create-location

Locations are used to fulfill orders

This topic covers the process for creating a new location used to fulfill orders.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Administrator** privileges to fabric Orders. For more information, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.

## Creating a Location

1. In the left menu, click **Inventory** > **Locations**.

   The **Locations** page is displayed.

2. Click **Create Location**.

   The **Create Location** page is displayed.

By default, all new locations are assigned **Active** status. Locations with an **Active** status are part of your inventory network, while those with an **Inactive** status aren't.

1. You can remove a location from your inventory network by changing the **Active** toggle setting to **InActive**.

### Adding basic information

1. In the **Location Name** field, enter a name.

   fabric suggests that you provide a descriptive and unique name for each location. For example, *Washington large item warehouse*.

2. In the **Location Number** field, enter a location number.

3. In the **Location type** field, select one of the following options:

   * **Store**
   * **Distribution Center** (DC)

   Two different location types are available, **Store** and **Distribution Center** (DC).

4. In the **Coordinate 1** and **Coordinate 2** fields, enter the location's longitude and latitude coordinates.

   The coordinates are used for geolocation during order allocation. The longitude value must fall between *-180* and *180*, and the latitude value must be between *-90* and *90*. For example, Coordinate 1 can be set to *-122.3493* and Coordinate *2* set to *47.6205*.

### Adding an operating schedule

The **Operating Schedule** sections contains an **Operating Hours** tab, where you can add the location’s hours with the option with separate hours for store operation and curbside pickup.

1. (Optional) To enable specific operating hours, click the **Enable specific operating hours (optional)** field.

   The **Select working days** and **Store hours and curbside pickup are the same** fields are displayed.

2. In the **Select working days** field, choose the days you want to set as working days.

   For each selected day, **Operating hours** and **Operation location** fields are displayed.

3. In the **Operating hours** fields, select the opening and closing hours.

   Clicking the operating hours field opens a menu with increments of 30 minutes starting at 12:00 AM.

4. In the **Operating location** field, select one of the following options:

   * **Store and Curbside Pickup**
   * **Store only**
   * **Curbside pickup only**
   * **Closed**

5. (Optional) To have separate hours for **Curbside** and **Store**, click the plus (`+`) icon.

   A new blank day is added where you can select different **Operating hours** and a different **Operating location**. Selecting the copy icon clones the day, and selecting the delete icon deletes the row.

### Capacity limits

You can optionally set the maximum number of allocations that a location can process at one time. By default, capacity limits are disabled. Disabling the capacity limit allows the location to be assigned unlimited allocations for fulfillment, until inventory is unavailable.

1. To set a capacity limit, click **Enable capacity limit (optional)**.

   The **Default Capacity Limit** field is displayed.

2. Enter the capacity limit.

### Contact & address

In the **Contact & Address** section, fill out the information for a primary contact for the location, as well as, the location’s physical address.

All fields are optional except for **Region** which is required.

After updating the capacity limits, you can click **Create** to create the location or proceed to adding **Custom Attributes**.

## Custom Attributes

Clicking the **Custom Attributes** tab opens the **Additional Attributes** section for the **Create Location** page.

When you want to reference locations in network rules during fulfillment, you can assign attributes, such as a region, to each location. This prevents fulfillments from taking place in the wrong region. For example, a retailer might have warehouses in the United States, Europe, and Mexico. This retailer can create a *North America* network that references all locations in North America using the *location* attribute. When fulfilling orders, the fulfillment ruleset will ensure that the region matches the location with inventory preventing costly fulfillments outside North America.

1. To add custom attributes, click the **Add custom attributes** field.

   A list of location attributes is displayed. When creating an order attribute, you are asked to provide a section. Only the attributes for the location section are displayed. You can create a new location attribute by following the instructions in the [Order Attributes](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/order-attributes) section.

2. Select the attributes that you want to add.

   Clicking an attribute displays a checkmark next to it and adds it to the **Add custom attribute** field.

3. Click **Add**.

4. Depending on the attributes that are selected, enter the required attribute value.

   For example, if you select **location**, a **location** field is displayed, and you can enter your location’s address. This attribute can then be referenced when creating an [order fulfillment ruleset](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-fulfillment-logic/create-a-new-rule-set-ui).


# Exporting Locations
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/inventory/export-locations



The export record CSV files consist of locations, scheduled outages, and temporary capacity override data. The exported data is based on the filters currently applied to the **Locations** table, which consists of the location number, name, address, status, and capacity. You can export records for particular locations by applying the necessary filters to refine the results before exporting. These records can be used by your internal systems or third-party tools.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Administrator** privileges to fabric Orders. For more information, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.

## Exporting Location Records

1. In the left menu, click **Inventory** > **Locations**.

   The **Locations** page is displayed.

2. Click **Export**.

   The **Export** window is displayed. Each export type displays how many locations, scheduled outages, or temporary capacity plans are available. The results depend on the filters applied and the locations displayed based on those filters.

3. Select one of the following export types:

   * **Locations data**: Displays the number of locations found within your filter parameters. Select this option to export data containing all location attributes and store hours.
   * **Scheduled outages**: Displays the number of locations with scheduled outages found within your filter parameters. Select this option to export all outage attributes such as `outageId`, `OutageNumber`, `locationNumber`, schedule dates, and the `reasonCode`.
   * **Temporary capacity plans**: Displays the number of locations with temporary capacity overrides found within your filter parameters. Select this option to export all temporary capacity override attributes such as `capacityOverrideId`, `capacityOverrideNumber`, `locationNumber`, schedule dates, and the `reasonCode`.

4. Click **Export**.

   The export is downloaded as a .ZIP file that contains a CSV file and saved to your computer. Additionally, a window is displayed with a link to the **Activity Log** page. This page allows you to re-download the export and view its status.

# Locations Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/inventory/locations-overview



Locations in fabric provide a centralized way to manage store and warehouse information. Each location contains essential information, such as an address, operating schedule, support for scheduled closures, and capacity limits to ensure efficient operations. You can also define custom attributes to capture unique location-specific data, tailoring the system to your needs.

## Key Features

* **Operating Schedules**: Allows businesses to define a location’s operating hours, including separate schedules for in-store operations and curbside pickup. It also supports scheduled closures to ensure accurate order fulfillment availability.

* **Capacity Limits**: Set optional limits on the number of orders or inventory allocations a location can process simultaneously. This helps manage workload and prevent overcommitment.

* **Custom Attribute Support**: Allows businesses to assign custom attributes to locations, such as region, fulfillment priority, or special handling requirements. This helps optimize order routing and supports network-based fulfillment rules.

## Use Case

### Scheduled closures

During the *Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade* in New York City, several retail locations and fulfillment centers in the area experience road closures, heavy foot traffic, and restricted access. To prevent inventory allocation requests and order fulfillment delays, scheduled closures are set up for affected locations. This ensures that online orders are automatically rerouted to other nearby stores or distribution centers that remain accessible.

For example, a store in *Midtown Manhattan* might be temporarily unavailable for fulfillment, redirecting orders to a warehouse in *New Jersey* instead. This prevents logistical bottlenecks, ensures accurate delivery timelines, and allows local store staff to focus on in-person customers attending the event.

# Networks Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/inventory/networks-overview



A network is a collection of available locations that simplifies Available-to-Promise (ATP) visibility for the storefront. Networks can be structured based on item types, such as hazardous materials, geographic regions, or country/region-specific availability. By combining multiple store locations into a single network, you can create an aggregate inventory view that displays accurate ATP numbers without requiring additional calculations. This provides you with real-time inventory availability, improving efficiency and customer experience.

## Use Cases

### Item filtering

Networks ensure customers see accurate product availability based on inventory status. When your storefront uses a network to fetch categories such as in-stock, safety stock, backorder, and preorder, fabric can provide the correct purchasing options. For example, if a popular pair of sneakers is in high demand, customers will see whether their size and color are available for immediate purchase, on backorder with an estimated restock date, or open for preorder before the next release. This improves transparency, manages customer expectations, and helps prevent overselling.

### Region-based networks

As an international retailer operating in multiple countries, you must account for variations in inventory availability due to regional restrictions, supplier agreements, and demand differences. By structuring inventory networks by country, customers browsing your online store will only see products that are available for purchase in their region. For instance, an item available in the U.S. but restricted in Canada would not appear for Canadian shoppers, preventing order fulfillment issues and improving the shopper experience.

# Creating a Rule Set
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-fulfillment-logic/create-a-new-rule-set-ui



The following guide contains examples and field descriptions for the Order Fulfillment Logic (OFL) user interface.

## Basic Information

| Field name                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Values |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Fulfillment Rule Set Name (Required)** | The name of the rule set. This name is displayed in the table on the Fulfillment Rules page.                                                                                                                                                                     | String |
| **Description (optional)**               | A description of the rule set. It's best practice to include a detailed description describing the purpose of the rule set for anyone viewing the rule set. If this is a cloned rule set with minor differences, describe the differences between each rule set. | String |

### Field descriptions

**Order Level Rule Groups** are run in order from the top down. If one of the rule conditions are met, this rule is executed and subsequent rules aren't run. If you wanted to move a rule up, you can drag and drop rules to change their order.

Item level rules runs in parallel and execute all rules even if a previous rule condition is met (including order level rules). This means item level rules override order level rules for the specified item.

### Condition fields

When creating any new rule, a condition is required. The condition is used to determine if a rule should be executed. A condition is used as the prerequisite to take an action.

Each condition you create executes from the top down. This means the order of your defined conditions matter. If you wanted to move a condition up, you can drag and drop conditions to change their order.

The following table outlines the available fields and their values for conditions.

| Field name    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Only supported expressions are displayed for an attribute.                                                                                                                 | • Equals  <br /><br />   • Doesn't equal  <br /><br />   • Contains  <br /> <br />  • Doesn't contain  <br /> <br />  • Less Than  <br /> <br />  • Less Than or Equal To <br /> <br />  • Greater Than  <br /> <br />  • Greater Than or Equal To                                                                          |
| **Value**     | The value of an attribute. For example, an online order can have the attribute *type* with a value equal to *STH* (Ship to home). This value can also be *SDD* (Same day delivery). Multiple values are supported.                                                   | String                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Action fields

Each action you create executes from the top down. This means the order of your defined actions matters. If you wanted to move an action up, you can drag and drop actions to change their order.

There are 3 different **Fulfillment Rule Type** options. These rule types determine which additional action field options are made available.

* **Provided location:** Buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS). The order itself has the location and it doesn't need to be provided.
* **Static Location:** Use this method if you want to predefine where all your orders will be fulfilled from when meeting a rule/condition. This can be any location that you provide along with the associated location number. For example, as a retailer you can choose to ship all web ship orders from the `DC 975` location. Additionally, you can use this method for item level rules to assign fulfillment locations for particular SKUs. For example, you can provide a SKU that starts with 1122 and set this SKUs specific fulfillment location.
* **Location Prioritization** Location prioritization allows for multiple inventory networks and additional features such as geo-location, split shipments, and item exclusions. This method is best used for retailers who have a lot of store presence or multiple warehouses in a particular region. It also provides the most flexibility if you want to split shipments from different locations for a single order.

Once an **Fulfillment Rule Type** is selected, depending on the selected type, different fields outlined in the table below are made available.

| Field name                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Value                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Location Numbers**                 | Used to configure the distribution location number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | String                                                                                                                    |
| **Allows Partial Fulfillment**       | Set this value to Yes if you want to allow the order to be partially filled if one or more of the SKU’s aren't available at a particular location. For example, if an order had 5 table lamps and 1 chair but you did not have the chair available, the 5 table lamps are shipped and the chair is ignored. Setting this value to No cancels the order if it can't be fully fulfilled.                                                                                                                                                        | Yes/No                                                                                                                    |
| **Included Location Types**          | A dropdown containing all the available configured inventory networks. This option is only available for the Location Prioritization action type. All the locations that are selected will be checked for inventory availability based on the additional geo locations, split shipment, and exclude fields selected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Value is based on your available fulfillment locations. All configured locations are listed. For example: StoreDropshipDC |
| **Geolocation**                      | Enable this field if you want to fulfill shipments based on the customers shipping location. If this field is set to No, Initial Boundary, Increment Size, and Maximum Boundary aren't used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Yes/No                                                                                                                    |
| **Initial Boundary**                 | The initial circumference boundary when determining geo-location. For example, if the value 100 is provided, fabric will look to see if any Included Location Types can fulfill the order within 100 miles of the shipping location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Number                                                                                                                    |
| **Increment Size**                   | Incremental Boundary In Miles is the number of miles you want to add every time search is performed. This means if the Initial Boundary was unable to fulfill an order, the incremental circumference is increased by the number specified here. For example, we can set this value set to 50. If no stores were in the first 100 miles entered in Initial Boundary, the search boundary is increased to 100-150, then 150-200, until it reaches the Maximum Boundary value.                                                                  | Number                                                                                                                    |
| **Maximum Boundary**                 | The maximum search radius. Once the Increment Size reaches this number and the order can't be fulfilled, the order is canceled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Number                                                                                                                    |
| **Inventory Balancing**              | The Inventory Balancing dropdown has two values, Distance and InventoryAvailability. Selecting Distance means the order fulfillment is completed by the nearest store with the items in stock. Selecting InventoryAvailability, means fabric looks at each of the eligible stores within your boundary and chooses the store with the most inventory. For example, if a store had 1 item remaining and another store had 5 of the same item within the search boundary, the order fulfillment would default to the store with more inventory. | DistanceInventoryAvailability                                                                                             |
| **Order Level Split Shipments**      | Setting this value to Yes enables orders to be fulfilled through multiple stores if the SKU’s or items aren't available at a single location. Setting this value to No means that fabric must find a location that has every item for an order at a single fulfillment location. If fabric is unable to find all the items in the order at a single location, the entire order is canceled.                                                                                                                                                   | Yes/No                                                                                                                    |
| **Item Level Split Shipments**       | Set this value to Yes if you want to look between locations to meet the item quantity request of an order. For example, if an order for 20 of the same office chair came in, and a location only had 15 available, the remaining 5 chairs would be sourced from another location. With this set to No, the remaining quantity of chairs are canceled and only the 15 at the first location are allocated.                                                                                                                                     | Yes/No                                                                                                                    |
| **Maximum Splits allowed per order** | The maximum number of locations that a split order can be fulfilled from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Number                                                                                                                    |
| **Item exclusions**                  | Allows you to create an additional condition based on an item attribute. For example, if an item is less than \$10, you can create a condition to ship it from a retail store near the customer to save on shipping costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Yes/No                                                                                                                    |

## Creating a Fulfillment Rule Set

Requirements:

* Allocate orders to different fulfillment locations based on a the selected shipping type during checkout.
* Configure geographic distance rules for same day shipping.
* Configure rules around split shipments.
* Configure a price/margin rule for items under a certain cost.
* Configure an auto cancel rule for shipments that can't be fulfilled.
* Create a default dropship rule to ship directly from the factory for orders that can't be fulfilled from the main fulfillment locations.

Using the above requirements, the examples outlined in this document assume that both a web store and retail locations are available. The web store allows customers to select two different types of shipping: default and expedited. In the `Order` attribute are the attribute types `STH` (ship to home) and `SDD` (same day delivery). The rules that are created must automatically send an order to a specific location based on the shipping type selected during checkout.

The following examples outline how to create a rule set for each requirement. Although the conditions and requirements are separate examples in this document, note that all of the following examples make up a single **Fulfillment Rule Set** and that only one rule set can be active at any given time.

All of the examples below build upon one another.

## Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Administrator** privilege for fabric Orders. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles.mdx).

### Create a new rule set

1. Using the left navigation, click **Orders** > **Fulfillment**.
   * The **Fulfillment Rule Set** page is displayed.
2. To create a new rule, click **Create Rule Set**.
3. In the **Basic Information** section, provide a **Fulfillment rule set name**, and optionally a **description**.
   * It's best practice to always provide a description indicating what the rule is doing and its purpose.

### Example 1 - Allocate orders to specific fulfillment locations

This example fulfills the following requirements:

* Allocates orders to different fulfillment locations based on a the selected shipping type during checkout.
* Geographic distance rules for same day shipping.
* Creates rules for split shipments.

To create a rule, you must first define the condition for when the rule should be executed.

1. In the **Setup your set of rules** section, a default rule is provided in the subsection for **Order Level Rule Group**. Click the edit icon to rename the default rule.
   * In this example, the first rule is called **Allocate to fulfillment locations \[ STH ]**.
   * Expanding the field reveals the **Add condition** and **Add action** buttons. A blank default condition and action are provided. The fields populated for **Attribute** are all based on your **Attribute type** which is automatically set to `Order`. This can't be changed.
2. In the **Attribute** field, select `type`.
3. In the **Operator** field, select `Equals`.
4. In the **Value** field, enter `STH` as the value.
   * This condition makes it so an action is triggered when the condition for an order is `STH`. Note that in your instance, ship to home may not be equal to the value `STH`. For example, the value could be `Ship_To_Home`. It's suggested that you check your `Order` schema to determine what values are allowed/expected.

Once a condition is created, the **Fulfillment Rule Type** needs to be set. The **Fulfillment Rule Type** determines what happens when a condition is met. In this example, the action needs to direct `STH` orders to the `DC` fulfillment warehouse.

1. In the **Fulfillment Rule Type** field, select **Multi Location Single Ship Fulfillment**.
   * Additional fields appear. If you only have a single fulfillment location and aren't expecting additional conditions, you can use **Configured Location** and enter the location number without needing to follow the remaining steps.
2. Set the **Included Location Types** field to where you want to fulfill `STH` orders.
   * In this example, `STH` orders need to be fulfilled in `DC`.
3. The remaining available options aren't needed in the `STH` use case. For more information on each of these fields, visit the [Action fields table](#action-fields). The following list is an example of what the default values look like:
   * Set **Geolocation** to `No`.
   * Set **Order Level Split Shipments** to `No`.
   * Set **Item Level Split Shipments** to `No`.
   * Set **Allows Partial Fulfillment** to `Yes`.
   * Set **Maximum Splits allowed per order** to `3`.
   * Set **Item exclusions** set to `No`.

This creates our first rule which is executed when the shipping method `STH` is selected during checkout. However, in order to create a same day delivery `SSD` condition, an additional rule is needed.

1. Click **Add Rule**.
2. In the **Attribute** field, select `type`.
3. In the **Operator** field, select `Equals`.
4. In the **Value** field, enter `SDD` as the value.
   * This condition makes it so an action is triggered when the condition for an order is `SDD` (same day delivery). Note that in your instance, same day delivery may not be equal to the value `SDD`. For example, the value could be `expedite` or `same_day_delivery`. It's suggested that you check your `Order` schema to determine what value is expected.
5. Set the **Included Location Types** field to the main warehouse `DC` and retail locations `Store`.
   * If we had additional distribution methods, they could be selected here.
6. Set the **Geolocation** field to `Yes`.
   * The **Geolocation** feature looks at the customer's location and sees if any of our inventory networks within a set distance are able to fulfill the order.
   * Unlike `STH`, `SDD` requires that we take into consideration where the items are located in relation to the shipping location. This is because we want to fulfill the order as quickly as possible and ship from the closest location to the customer.
7. Set the geolocation boundaries.
   The following settings look for a store from 0-100 miles from the customer's shipping address that can fulfill the order. If the order can't be fulfilled, it then searches between 100-200 miles and finally, 200-300 miles.
   * Set the **Initial Boundary** field to `100`.
   * Set the **Increment Size** field to `100`.
   * Set the **Maximum Boundary** field to `300`.
8. Set the **Inventory Balancing** field to one of the following values:
   * **Distance**: The order fulfillment is completed by the nearest store with the items in stock.
   * **InventoryAvailability**: Looks at each of the eligible stores within the geo-location boundary and chooses based on maximum available stock. For example, if multiple stores had the items in stock and one store had 1 item remaining, whereas another store had 5, the order fulfillment would default to the store with 5 inventory.
9. Split shipments are used to fulfill orders from multiple fulfillment locations. Each split shipment method changes how an order is fulfilled. Depending on your individual needs and logistics, one or more of these methods may not be feasible. Visit the [Action fields table](#action-fields), for more information on each of these fields and examples.
   * Set the **Order Level Split Shipments** field to `Yes`.
   * Set the **Item Level Split Shipments** field to `Yes`.
   * Set the **Allows Partial Fulfillment** field to `Yes`.
   * Leave the **Maximum Splits allowed per order** field as the default value of `3`.
10. Set the **Item exclusions** field to `No`.

### Example 2 - Create a price rule for items under a set cost

This example fulfills the following requirements:

* Creates a price/margin rule for items under a certain cost.
* Configures an auto cancel rule for shipments that can't be fulfilled.

There are three ways to create price rules. If you must ship certain items from certain locations, it's recommended you use the third method described below:

* Create a new rule with the condition specifying a price.
* Add an item exclusion to an existing condition.
* Use item level rules to provide a condition and action for all items within a certain price range.

If you wish to follow along, please review the following example [Allocate Orders to Specific Fulfillment Locations](#example-1---allocate-orders-to-specific-fulfillment-locations). The example below builds upon this example.

The allocate orders to a specific fulfillment location rule set allocates ship to home `STH` orders to a `DC` fulfillment location. Same day delivery `SDD` orders are fulfilled based on geographical location and can be shipped from retail stores or the `DC` fulfillment location.

1. Using the Allocate to fulfillment locations \[ STH ] rule, set the **Item exclusions** field to `Yes`.
   * Enabling **Item exclusions** creates a new **Item Exclusion** condition above your action with the **Entity** default set to `Item`.
2. Set the **Attribute** field to `price.itemUnitPrice`.
3. Set the **Operator** field to `Less Than or Equal To`.
4. In the **Value** field, enter `5`.
   * This condition now checks to see if any item is less than or equal to 5\$. If an item meets this condition, it's excluded from that action. In other words, if **Item exclusions** is `Yes`, fabric looks at the next action in a rule that has been specified.

At this point, if you don't configure a default condition or add an additional action, the items that fall under the exclude condition are never added to an order. This means those items are canceled and depending on if you have **Allows Partial Fulfillment** enabled or not, the shipment is cancelled.

There are two options for making sure small items are shipped.

* Create another action within the same rule where the exclusion exists.
* Create an item level rule.

In this example an item level rule is created.

1. Rename the default item rule from the **Item Level Rule Group** section to `Items under 5$`.
2. Set the **Attribute** field to `price.itemUnitPrice`.
3. Set the **Operator** field to `Less Than or Equal To`.
4. In the **Value** field, enter `5`.
5. In the **Fulfillment Rule Type** field, select **Multi Location Single Ship Fulfillment Method**.
6. Set the **Included Location Types** field to include `Store`.
   * If instead of using retail stores you had specific warehouses to ship smaller items from, you could instead use **Configured Location Fulfillment Method** and enter the location numbers.
7. Set the **Geolocation** field to `Yes`.
   * The locations should be limited based on shipping costs and logistics.
   * Set the **Initial Boundary** field to `200`.
   * Set the **Increment Size** field to `100`.
   * Set the **Maximum Boundary** field to `400`.
8. Set the **Inventory Balancing** field to `Distance`.
   * This ensures the item is shipped from the closest store.
9. Set all of the split shipment options to `No`.
   * It would be too costly to ship items under \$5 from multiple different locations for a single order.
   * Set the **Order Level Split Shipments** field to `No`.
   * Set the **Item Level Split Shipments** field to `No`.
   * Set the **Allows Partial Fulfillment** field to `No`.
     * You can choose to enable partial fill if you want to partially fill an order.
   * Leave the **Maximum Splits allowed per order** field as the default value of `3`.
10. Set the **Item exclusions** field to `No`.

This item level rule accounts for all items under 5 dollars and ships items under 5 dollars from the nearest retail location.

### Example 3 - Create a default dropship action

Sometimes, you are unable to fulfill an order from any of your available fulfillment locations. When this happens, you can create an action to fulfill the order directly from a factory dropship location. With this type of action in place, orders with partially filled SKUs and items not currently in stock can still be fulfilled.

If you wish to follow along, please review the following example [Allocate Orders to Specific Fulfillment Locations](#example-1---allocate-orders-to-specific-fulfillment-locations). The example below builds upon this example. The allocate orders to a specific fulfillment location rule set allocates ship to home `STH` orders to a `DC` fulfillment location. Same day delivery `SDD` orders are fulfilled based on geographical location and can be shipped from retail stores or the `DC` fulfillment location.

In this example, an additional action is added to backfill orders with no inventory. If an order can't be fulfilled, the remaining items are sent to a dropship location to be fulfilled at a later time.

1. In the **Allocate to fulfillment locations \[ STH ]** rule, click the **Add action**.
   * You will already have an action to fulfill orders from `DC` from the previous example. A new action must be created under it.
2. In the **Fulfillment Rule Type** field, select **Location Prioritization**.
3. Set the **Included Location Types** field to include `Dropship`, `store`, and `DC`.
   * Every fulfillment location is selected to ensure the order is fulfilled if possible.
4. In the first action, set the **Allows Partial Fulfillment** field to `Yes`.
   * If this is disabled, the order will be canceled because it can't be fulfilled in the first action. Actions execute from the top down.
   * Alternatively, if you wanted to guarantee that an order is fulfilled, you would also set **Item Level Split Shipments** and **Order Level Split Shipments** to `Yes`. However, this can complicate shipping logistics making it so certain orders might have multiple shipping locations for different SKUs. Check with your team to determine what settings should be enabled based on your individual needs.
5. All remaining fields can be left as their default values.

# Updating a Rule Set
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-fulfillment-logic/manage-rule-sets



To prevent fulfillment or distribution from breaking due to changes, direct editing of rule sets is disabled. Instead, once you have completed your edits, the **Clone** option is enabled. A cloned rule set acts as a entirely new rule set allowing you to set it as the primary active rule set.

Note that only one rule set can be active at a time.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Administrator** privileges to fabric Orders. For more detailed information on these settings, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.

## Procedure

1. Using the left navigation, select **Orders** > **Fulfillment**.

   * The **Fulfillment Rule Set** page is displayed.

2. Using the **ID** or **Name**, find the rule set you want to update.

   * The fulfillment rule set table alphabetically sorts your rule sets (A-Z) with your active rule set at the top.

3. Click the **ID**.

   * The **Edit Fulfillment Rule Set** page is displayed.

4. Click **Clone**.

   * Editing is disabled until you clone the rule set.

5. In the **Basic Information** section, provide a new **Fulfillment rule set name** and **description**.

   * Because this is a clone of the previous rule set, it can be confusing if you don't change the name.

6. In the **Setup your set of rules** section, click an order level or item level rule to expand and reveal the conditions and actions for that rule.

7. Make edits to the fields you want to change.

   * For more detailed information on each of the fields, see the [Creating a Rule Set](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-fulfillment-logic/create-a-new-rule-set-ui#field-descriptions) field descriptions section.

8. Click **Save**.

The edited rule set is added to the **Fulfillment Rule Set** table.

# Order Fulfillment Logic Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-fulfillment-logic/order-fulfillment-logic



The order fulfillment feature allows you to create fulfillment rule sets. Fulfillment rule sets are used to direct orders to different fulfillment locations based on characteristics, such as geo-location, warehouse location, item price, order attribute type, and more.

## Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Administrator** privilege for fabric Orders. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](../../settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles.mdx).

## Rule Setup

When creating a new fulfillment rule set, you must provide some basic information along with the rules in the [order level rule group](###order-level-rule-group) or [item level rule group](###item-level-rule-group) sections. Ensure that you create all your rules in a single fulfillment rule set because only one rule set can be active at a time.

### Order level rule group

When you create rules in the **Order Level Rule Group**, they're executed in the order that they're sorted. This means rules are executed from the top down. You can drag and drop rules to execute in any order as needed. Its important to note that when a rules condition is met, the additional rules defined below it aren't executed. If no rule conditions are met and no default condition is provided, the rules are all ignored.

#### Example

Let's assume 2 rules are defined. One for fulfilling online orders at a specified fulfillment warehouse, and one for packaging specific online orders (based on the shipping location) at a different warehouse equipped to package unique orders. If the order of the rules contains the first rule at the top and the second rule below, the second rule can't run because the first rules condition is always met before the second rule has executed. However, if we were to swap the rules order and run the second rule first, it would guarantee that the rule is run. If fabrics rules condition isn't met, fabric proceeds to run the next rule below. This means the last rule (as a best practice) should be a default catch-all and very specific rules with unique conditions should be run first.

### Item level rule group

Item level rules run in parallel and execute all rules even if a previous rule condition is met (including order level rules). This means item level rules override order level rules. The **Attribute type** is limited to the `Item` attribute type and only allows you to create conditions based on item attribute values such as `price.ItemUnitPrice`. This allows item level rules to control where certain items are fulfilled from and guarantees a static fulfillment location regardless of the order level rules you have implemented.

Item level rules are often used when you set up certain item exclusions. This could be specific SKUs that ship from a particular warehouse, items under a certain price point, items that weigh a lot, and more.

### Frequently asked questions

What happens if more than one condition is met for an order?

* If the rules are within the **Order Level Rule Group** section, the rules are executed from the top down. For example, if the first rules condition is fulfilled, subsequent rules aren't run on that order. Rules defined within **Item Level Rule Group** always execute. This is because the rules are run on specific item conditions rather than order conditions.

What happens if an item level rule conflicts with a order level rule?

* Because item level rules run at the item level, they always take priority over order level rules. For example, an order level rule specifies shipping an order with 5 items and one of the items in the order fulfills the condition for an item level rule. In this event, 4 of the items are shipped based on the action defined in the order level rule. The item that meets the item level rule condition is shipped based on the action defined in the item level rule.

Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-management/exchange-orders



You can exchange an entire order or the individual products in an order. The system automatically calculates any price differences for the exchanged products. The exchange option for an order is enabled only after the payment process is initiated for the order. Orders with the **Fraud** status can't be exchanged.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Administrator** privileges to fabric Orders. For more information, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.

## Procedure

To exchange an item, the return process is initially followed.

1. In the left menu, click **Orders**.

   The **Orders** tab is displayed on the **Manage Orders** page.

2. To find the order, use the [search or filter options](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-management/filtering-orders) on the **Manage Orders** page.

3. In the orders table, click the **Order Number**.

   The order details are displayed on the **Basic details** tab.

4. In the top-right of the page, click **Return Order**.

   The **Return order** page is displayed.

5. In the **Select SKUs to return** section, do one of the following:

   * To exchange an entire order, select the **Refund entire order** checkbox.
     This automatically checks all items in the order and sets the maximum exchange quantity for each SKU.

   * To exchange specific items, click the checkbox next to the SKU you want to exchange and use the **+** or **-** buttons to set the quantity.

   The **Refund summary** is updated.

6. Click **Next**.

7. If multiple exchange reasons exist for each SKU, clear the **Same reason code for all SKUs** field.

8. In the **Action** field, select **Exchange**.

9. In the **Reason code** field, select a reason code.

   You can add additional information for the exchange by selecting **Add sub-reason code** and by providing the information in the **Sub-reason code** field.

10. Click **Next**.

    The **Items to send customer in exchange** section is displayed.

11. In the **Your network** field, select a network.

    After selecting a network, which is a group of locations sharing inventory, the available products for browsing are filtered accordingly.

12. In the **Your channel** field, select a channel.

13. Click **Browse SKUs**.

    The **Browse SKUs** window is displayed with a product table.

14. To find the product in the **Browse SKUs** window, in the search bar, enter the search keywords and press **Enter**.

    You can use the filters to refine the search results and find a specific product.

    The Stock status for a product must be **Available** and **Availability** must be greater than or equal to one to process the exchange. If you add an unavailable product, an error message is displayed.

15. Select **Product title** checkbox for the products that you want to exchange.

16. Click **Add SKUs**.

    You can remove SKUs by clicking **Remove SKUs**. This option is only displayed if a SKU is added to the exchange.

17. In the **When should exchange items ship** field, select one of the following:

    * **Ship upon receiving return:** This option prevents the new exchanged items from shipping until the previous items are received and processed.

    * **Ship exchange items immediately:** This option immediately sends the exchange request to the nearest fulfillment location to ship. fabric recommends that you only use this option for specific loyalty tiers.

18. Click **Next**.

    The **Confirm** section is displayed with an overview of the exchange.

19. Click **Confirm**.

The order status is updated to **Exchanged**.

### Refund Summary

The **Refund summary** section displays a breakdown of the total amount being refunded. Selecting more than one item to refund or exchange updates the summary accordingly. The following table describes each field in the **Refund summary** section.

# Exporting Orders
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-management/exporting-orders



The Export feature provides you with the ability to export all your order-related data. This topic covers the process of exporting order data.

Previous exports can be viewed in the **Orders > Activity Log** page. You can download previous export files from this page.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the **Orders & Inventory Editor** or **Admin** privilege for fabric Orders. For more information, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.

## Export logic

Exporting downloads a zip folder containing a JSON source file or multiple CSV files depending on the option you select.

### JSON

The JSON zip folder contains a single JSON file. The JSON file contains objects for each `orderId`. Each order object contains the entire history and information of an order including the SKUs for each item in the order.

### CSV

The CSV zip folder contains CSV files for orders (exported by item), adjustments, appeasements, discounts, logs, notes, payments, and shipInfo.

Each row in the order CSV file represents a product in the order. If an order contains multiple products, duplicate `orderId` rows are displayed for each product.

The following table outlines each column in the order CSV file and provides example values. Values in the CSV file are populated only if the data is available.

| Column name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                | Example value                        |

# Filtering Orders
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-management/filtering-orders



The **Manage Orders** page displays a list that includes every order. This list can be filtered by **Order Status**, **Order Date**, **Order Total**, and **Channel** so that the list only displays orders that match the filter parameters.

To view additional filters, click the **More** button. The additional options allow you to filter by most data points associated with an order, such as the customer’s name, contact information, currency, payment statuses, and more.

You can apply any combination of standard filters and additional filters from the **More** menu simultaneously.

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-management/overview



fabric Orders is a distributed order management (DOM) platform that helps you manage the order fulfillment process and provide inventory details, order fulfillment, and customer service.

The **Manage Orders** feature helps you to create real-time orders in the orders database, unify order data, get existing order information, track orders, update orders, add additional products to an order, process cancellations, returns, and exchanges. Additionally, you can use this feature to flag fraudulent orders, which then can be either released from hold or canceled.

### Order Statuses

You can find the order status on the **Orders** and **Orders > Basic details** page. These statuses describe the current status of an individual order within the order lifecycle. The following table describes each order status:

| Order Status                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Allocation Statuses

Allocations serve as fulfillment location records and are used by Warehouse Management Services (WMS) or Point of Sales Services (POS). If an allocation is not acknowledged, you can use the [acknowledge shipment](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/shipments/acknowledge-shipment) endpoint to set up alerts to warn operators of the issue.

You can find the **Allocation Status** on the **Allocation** and **Orders > Allocations** page. This status describes the current allocation status of each individual SKU. The following table describes each allocation status:

| Allocation Status                | Description                                                                                                                                             |

### Shipment Statuses

You can find the **Shipment status** on the **Shipment**, **Orders > Shipments**, and **Orders > Basic details** pages. When shipping multiple items from different locations or carriers, each group of items in an order is assigned a separate shipment status.

The **Allocations** tab displays all the allocations associated with a specific order number. This includes the allocation date, SKU, status, and additional allocation attributes.

## Allocation Details

Each allocation has its own **Allocation ID** and you can have multiple allocations for a single order. Allocations are sorted by the most recent allocation request.

By default, each allocation displays **Allocation ID**, **Parent allocation ID**, **Allocation request ID**, and **Allocation date**. Clicking **View more attributes** displays the allocation attributes window with additional attributes.

The following table describes the different allocation attributes in the **View more attributes** window:

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/overview

Build a centralized source of order, inventory, and warehouse information with fabric Orders.

fabric Orders enable you to receive, track, and fulfill customer orders across sales channels, allow customers to track their orders, route orders through warehouses based on the customer’s location, and more.

Orders is designed to streamline and simplify order management and fulfillment processes during and after an order is created. When an order is created, a soft-reservation is made by the system at the network level. After making a sourcing decision, the soft-reservation is reversed and a hard reservation is made at the location level, such as a warehouse or fulfillment center.

## Key Features

Orders is divided into five separate sections accessible from the left column in fabric Copilot:

* [Manage orders](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-management/overview) allows you to create orders in the database in real-time, unify order data, get existing order information, track orders, update orders, add additional products to an order, process cancellations, returns, and exchanges.
* [Fulfillment](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-fulfillment-logic/order-fulfillment-logic) allows you to create fulfillment rule sets, which are used to direct orders to different fulfillment locations based on characteristics, such as geo-location, warehouse location, item price, order attribute type, and more.
* [Activity Log](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/activity-log) displays your order import and export history.
* [Alerts](/v3/platform/home/alerts/alerts-overview) notifies you of potential issues using the data within your account.
* [Settings](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/overview) contains additional features and configurations such as Order Attributes, Shipping Methods, Backorder & Preorder, Policies, and Alerts.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

fabric Copilot provides the ability to restrict the access of different users to information and actions available to them through roles. For more information and instructions on how to set up these controls, see the [RBAC](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) documentation.

## Integration Examples

**Allocation with fabric Orders:** After creating an order using fabric Orders service, the orders service sends a request to fabric’s Allocation module for order allocation. Allocation calls Order Fulfillment Logic (OFL) and OFL rules to get the location number where the inventory is available based on the currently defined OFL rule system. After completion, OFL provides the necessary information to the Allocation service, and Allocation calls the inventory service to reserve items as needed, adjusting your inventory counters in real-time.

The Order fulfillment process is set up by integrating your existing fulfillment systems, such as a Warehouse Management System (WMS), with fabric's Allocation APIs. This integration enables allocation-related events to start fulfillments in external systems, and allows external systems to make callbacks to the fabric Allocation APIs.

**Shipments & Tracking with fabric Orders:** fabric's Shipment APIs ensure that shipments are created for allocations. These APIs enable the warehouse or any external fulfillment system to generate shipments associated with the allocated orders.

Additionally, you can set up shipment tracking updates for orders by integrating your carrier tracking service with the Shipment Tracking APIs. These APIs enable the external carrier tracking service, such as ParcelLab, to post shipment events. With the order created, shipped, and tracking enabled, you can manage the order. This includes Cancellations, Appeasements, Exchanges, Credits, Returns, and more using the [Orders APIs](/v3/api-reference/orders/orders--3-0-0) or [Manage Orders](/v3/guides/orders/order-managment/overview) UI as needed.

**Notifications with fabric Orders:** Optionally, you can configure email updates for order transactions by integrating your preferred email service with the Notification APIs. This integration enables fabric Orders to deliver real-time email notifications for specific order update events.

**Fraud with fabric Orders:** To establish fraud prevention, you can integrate your preferred fraud service with the Fraud APIs. These APIs primarily allow for hold and release actions on the order, providing an effective means of preventing fraudulent activities.

## Benefits

* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**: Manage the customer lifetime vale through omnichannel orders. With all your data in one place, improve customer service by reducing call volume, average handle time, and increase support satisfaction. Improve order orchestration by reducing split shipments, OOS cancellations, and increasing on time delivery rate. As a multi-brand and multi-channel retailer, improve order processing time, reduce inventory cancellations, and subsequently increase support satisfaction.

* **Sell-through Rate (STR)**: You can increase sell-through rate by unifying and improving the Buy Online and Pickup in Store (BOPIS) experience, ship from store experience, and improved store inventory management.

* **Storefront Conversion Rate (CVR)**: Using real-time inventory coupled with backorder and preorder capabilities, you can increase sell-through rate, website conversion, and site merchandiser operational efficiency. Additionally, you can optimize your inventory and fulfillment by reducing split shipments, OOS cancellations, and increasing on time delivery rate.

## Example Use Cases

* **Exporting Sales and Reports Data**: Using fabric Orders export API, you can export data to be utilized for business intelligence or store the data externally as needed. The exports service flattens the JSON structure into columns, so that an external columnar database, such as an SQL database, can easily ingest the data. Exports can also be generated in fabric Copilot for ad-hoc analysis.

* **Fulfilling Backorders & Preorders**: During the order creation process within fabric Orders service, backorders and preorders are identified and flagged accordingly. This enables the backorder and preorder service to store these orders in a dedicated backorder queue. Fulfillment of these orders follows a *first in, first out* approach as inventory becomes available for the backorders.

  Additionally, consent to delay operations are implemented based on your configuration of backorder settings. Orders that exceed the specified backorder service level require customer consent to proceed with the delay. fabric triggers the consent to delay notification based on your configuration, and updates regarding consent to delay are managed through the consent to delay API endpoint.

* **Omnichannel Store Fulfillment**: You can maximize return on existing investments in physical locations, such as brick and mortar stores, by connecting ecommerce sales to store inventories that are eligible for direct-to-consumer shipments. By bringing store inventory into the fulfillment network, you can expand capacity for ecommerce sales and increase the available assortment for online shoppers.

* **Optimized Order Fulfillment Logic**: Using fabric's Order Fulfillment Logic (OFL) you can configure how orders are handled for different items, locations, sales, shipping types, and more. For example, multi-location fulfillment allows you to allocate orders to specific fulfillment locations based on factors, such as shipping type, geographic distance, and inventory availability. This flexibility enables efficient order processing and reduces shipping times. For same-day delivery optimization, fabric's geolocation feature can be utilized. It considers the customer's location and searches for inventory networks within a set distance that can fulfill the order the fastest. This feature can be configured with specific boundaries and inventory balancing options to ensure the fastest possible delivery. Split shipment management is another key feature, allowing orders to be fulfilled from multiple locations when necessary. This can be set up at both the order and item level, with options to allow partial fulfillment. This functionality is particularly useful when dealing with complex inventory situations or when aiming to optimize delivery times for multi-item orders.

* [Editing Shipping Methods](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/shipping-methods#editing-shipping-methods)

## Backorder & Preorders

Backorders are defined as orders for products that aren't currently available for fulfillment.

Preorders are defined as orders for products that aren't yet released.

* [Enable Backorders](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/backorder-preorder#allow-backorders)
* [Enable Preorders](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/backorder-preorder#allow-preorders)

## Policies

Policies enable you to define how your business handles returns, cancellations, and exchanges.

* [Creating Policies](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/policies#creating-a-policy)

* [Editing Policies](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/policies#managing-policies)

## Alerts

The Order Alerts setup page displays an overview of the currently configured order alerts. Order alerts are used to monitor trailing metrics that can affect revenue and efficiency such as returns, cancellations, reorder rates, payment failures, and more.

* [Creating Order Alerts](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/order-alerts#creating-order-alerts)
* [Editing Order Alerts](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/order-alerts#editing-an-alert)


# Order Policies
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/settings/policies



Policies allow you to define how your business processes returns, cancellations, and exchanges.

Any number of policies are supported, however, you can only have a one default policy each for returns, cancellations, and exchanges. Default policies apply when no other policy condition is met. For example, the default return policy might have a 5\$ return fee. However, for items with the `Overweight` attribute, the return fee should be higher. By creating a policy that looks for the product attribute `Overweight`, returns and exchanges with this attribute can be handled differently.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have **Administrator** or **Editor** privileges to fabric Orders. For more detailed information on these settings, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.

# Inventory FAQ
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/inventory-faq-s



#### How can I upload inventory if I have more than one POS, WMS, or other sources of truth for inventory?

1. Prepare a `.csv` file with the inventory details.
2. Create a URL by using the bulk operation endpoint `POST/api/v2/inventory/aws/upload-url`.
3. Upload the `.csv` file to the URL.

#### What are counters and how can I update them?

Counters are inventory positions, such as on-hand, allocated, shipped, and other customized positions. The types of counters are:

1. **Base Counter:** Base counters refer to `onHand`, `Allocated`, `Shipped`, and any other custom counters that are created using the counter endpoint. Allocated counters are automatically calculated during the order workflow. Merchants can update all base counters, except `Allocated`, by using the following endpoints:
   * Adjustment endpoint (`POST/v3/inventories/actions/find-and-adjust-inventory-counters`): Adjusts the counter quantity. Using this endpoint, you can only adjust the counter quantity, not other inventory details. You can increase or decrease the counter quantity by specifying the required quantity in the payload. For example, if the original counter quantity is 100 and you want to increase the quantity to 110, set the counter quantity as '+10' in the payload. The counter quantity is now updated to 110.
   * Update inventory endpoint(`POST/v3/inventories/action/find-and-update`): Updates counter quantity and other inventory details.
2. **Virtual Counter:**. Virtual counters refer to the counters available to purchase, `availableToPurchase`, which are calculated or updated during the order workflow. When an order is placed, the Order Management System (OMS) automatically allocates the order for shipping. After the order is allocated and shipped, the counters available to purchase is calculated based on the formula `onHand - allocated - shipped`.

#### How's data security or privacy managed for fabric’s Inventory module?

fabric’s REST APIs are protected with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and the identity introspector mechanism. In OIDC, identity information is communicated using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The data in fabric is stored in both MongoDB and S3. The MongoDB data is isolated per tenant in fabric Orders (also called OMS). You must create an [AWS configuration rule](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-aws-config-to-monitor-for-and-respond-to-amazon-s3-buckets-allowing-public-access/) to ensure that the AWS S3 Bucket doesn't have public access. For example, one shouldn't be able to run the following command:

`curl <https://inventory-oms-refresher-prod01.s3.amazonaws.com/chicosprod/export/store/FabricStoreInventorySync_CHO_2023-06-15T08-31-00-827090592Z.csv>
`

Whenever data is requested, fabric will generate a S3 presigned URL to ensure secure access.

#### What's the primary use case for fabric’s Inventory module?

The primary use case for fabric Inventory is to prevent *overselling* during transactions by providing real-time inventory data via REST API and event-driven integrations, for the storefront and other downstream applications to accurately display available products for sale.

#### What's the primary interface for user operations?

fabric Copilot is the Graphical User Interface where users may log in to manage their data via interactive web pages. Copilot provides an easy way for users to manage recurring operational workflows such as updating data where the solution architecture requires manual intervention. Copilot is also an easy way for implementation specialists to manage test data creation, updates, and configurations.

#### What's the primary interface for setting up integrations with Storefront and other applications?

fabric’s Inventory service provides over 30 OpenAPI 3.0 compliant REST API endpoints, documented under the API Reference at [https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/reference/about-inventory](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/inventory/overview), for users to manage data. These APIs are the same ones used in Copilot and can be integrated into the retailer's enterprise systems such as the storefront, inventory management systems, search, marketing platforms, and more. Not all APIs are available in Copilot, and some are required to use fabric Inventory for getting inventory in real-time from the storefront for use cases such as Ship-to-home, Omnichannel, and 'Buy Online Pickup In-Store' order placement.

#### How can I begin using fabric's Inventory module?

fabric’s Inventory module is typically packaged with fabric Orders (also called OMS). It provides enterprise-level inventory visibility with network aggregation and enables updating of order fulfillment logic without coding.

To get started using fabric’s Inventory module, follow these steps:

1. Sign up or log in to your fabric account.
2. Get an access token from fabric Copilot or using the [fetch access token](/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/authentication-endpoints/fetch-access-token) endpoint.
3. Familiarize yourself with the core concepts such as [Location](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/locations/overview), [Inventory](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/inventory/overview), [Network](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/inventory/networks), Counter, Virtual Counter, and other available features and options as described in the guide.
4. [Import](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/inventory/overview#importing-inventory) or add your initial inventory data.
5. Set up any additional configurations or preferences specific to your needs.

#### What are the differences between counters and virtual counters in fabric?

**Counters**, also called base counters, refer to inventory positions such as `onHand`, `Allocated`, `Shipped`, and any other counters that are configured using the counter endpoint. These values can be updated through the **Inventory detail** page in fabric Copilot or using the adjustment endpoint- POST/v3/inventories/actions/find-and-adjust-inventory-counters. This lets you increase or decrease the counter quantity, but it doesn't allow you to change other inventory details. Alternatively, you can use the update inventory endpoint- POST/v3/inventories/action/find-and-update, which allows you to update both the counter quantity and other inventory details.

**Virtual counters** refer to the aggregation of real-time inventory availability. The inventory virtual counters are viewable on the inventory landing page in fabric Copilot. Their calculation from counters is configured in the virtual counter calculation. Basically, these are computed from counters at runtime. For example, `availableToPurchase = onHand - allocated - shipped`.

#### What's the significance of inventory-imports in fabric’s Inventory module?

For most retailers with a warehouse, point of sale, or other inventory source of truth system, the first step to begin using fabric Inventory (after generating your access token) is importing your inventory. As a user of fabric Inventory, you should integrate your one or many inventory systems of record, such as WMS, ERP, or POS, with fabric Inventory. This allows fabric Inventory to manage a SSOT ('Single Source of Truth') for reference of inventory in your commerce applications including storefronts, search functionalities, and other areas within your ecommerce solution architecture.

#### How can retailers integrate existing inventory systems with fabric Inventory?

**Single Inventory Management System**

If retailers have a single system of record for inventory, the inventory-import process doesn't require any configuration for multiple file groups. If retailers don't have a need to manage inventory aggregation, order fulfillment, or location data in fabric OMS (also called Orders), they can start importing inventory against the default location using the Import API. To import your inventory data to fabric, you must upload a CSV file with all inventory details. You can download sample CSVs from Copilot within the inventory import modal, for your reference.

**Multiple Inventory Management Systems**

If retailers have multiple systems of record for inventory, they can use the "file groups" feature to configure their inventory feeds in fabric. This feature ensures that inventory updates are limited to the specific group of locations corresponding to the inventory system performing the upload

**Inventory updates in real-time with event-driven data streaming**

If retailers want a more real time approach than relying solely on CSV-driven bulk imports, we recommend to directly update inventory levels on a single-inventory basis using the update [inventory API](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/inventory/adjust-inventory-counters). To create or update inventory, you must provide the necessary fields including SKU, item ID, location, channel ID, and counters. If you are exclusively using the fabric Inventory module without the fabric Orders (OMS) module, you must manually update the reserved, allocated, and shipped counter quantities as orders are fulfilled.

#### Why should I use fabric Inventory as a Single Source of Truth for my Inventory?

For retailers with distributed inventory, fabric Inventory is an optimal solution for effectively managing the aggregation of real-time inventory into a Single Source of Truth (SSOT). For each location you want to manage inventory for, a location with a unique location number must exist. In addition, you can configure networks of locations sharing inventory using Network APIs.

For testing purposes, fabric Inventory is pre-configured with a default location where all inventory is initially assigned. To manage inventory for each specific location, it's necessary to have a unique location number to every SKU during bulk upload. You can configure networks of locations that share inventory, by using the Networks interface.

#### How do I manage Inventory aggregation in fabric?

Inventory aggregation rules can vary from simple to very complex. This is possible through the Network service of fabric’s Inventory module, which facilitates a real-time inventory aggregation functionality.

**Simple Aggregation**

If you manage inventory aggregation in an external system and don't plan to manage it within fabric, or if you don't have complex distributed fulfillment and inventory requirements, then the Simple Aggregation approach within fabric Inventory's Network feature may be suitable for your usage.

Your default network configuration is simple and requires no additional configuration to automatically aggregate all inventory in your “Sandbox” environment instance of fabric. This is possible because the rules in your default “starter” Network contains a rule for your default Location which dictates that, as long as the location `isActive` flag is set to “TRUE,” all inventory uploaded for your default location will be included in the aggregated inventory availability.

**Complex Aggregation**

Your network configuration can also be very complex. fabric’s Inventory Networks support the ability to create groups of inventory by defining “Inventory Networks” with inclusion and exclusion rules for inventory aggregation. Inventory Networks can aggregate inventory across groups of fulfillment centers for different selling requirements such as channels, brands, or fulfillment method eligibility. For example, you may want to create “Network C,” for domestic selling which includes all stores and warehouses, and “Warehouse Network,” for International selling which only includes warehouses. This can be achieved with the following two steps:

* First, create the rules ([https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/reference/createnetwork](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/networks/create-inventory-network))for how inventory is aggregated in stores and warehouses. You may want to set up a rule set for “Network A” called “Store Network” and another rule set for “Network B” called “Warehouse Network,” each of which can have different inclusion and exclusion parameters based on the attributes of your location and product data.
* In the second step, you may want to set up “Network C,” naming it “Domestic Selling,” and making it a “Multiple Network” type which is created by selecting the store inventory and warehouse inventory through the Multiple Network setup process. Now, you have a way to combine inventory pools for Domestic, while simply relying on the “Warehouse Network” for International selling. For both networks, you can call the Inventory API to look up inventory in real-time on the storefront, such as the Product Display Page (PDP) and other use cases, by passing the network code in the request object.

Before utilizing Complex Aggregation to use product data in fabric’s Network rule-setting interface, you must decide whether to use fabric's Product Catalog or a third-party product information management system. If you are using a third-party system, you must provide product details to fabric’s Catalog Connector.

To use product data in the Network rule-setting interface, decide whether you are using fabric’s Product Catalog or a third-party product information management system. If using a third-party system, you need to provide product details to the Catalog Connector.

Also, define your location details using the Locations service through either [Copilot](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/backorders-preorders/overview) or the [APIs](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/locations/overview). You may also configure custom attributes on the location model if you want to extend the JSON data model to support more fields.

**Note:** Custom attributes only support key-value data in a single “attributes” object of the service collection response format. Once a custom attribute is configured, it will apply for all data in the service collection.

#### What are the advanced configurations and features of fabric’s Inventory service?

**1. Backorder and Preorder**

Managing backorder and preorder inventory follows the same workflows as regular inventory, allowing seamless management through both [Copilot](/docs/orders-pre-order-and-backorder) and [API interfaces](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/backorders-preorders/overview). In the fabric Inventory module, the primary feature of Backorder and Preorder is the ability to reduce the available quantity of backorder or preorder products so that the inventory remains balanced even when orders are placed, and the inventory is marked as `OnHand` for availability.

**2. Safety Stock and Low Stock Setting**

In addition to the import-inventory and network features, you may configure values for `safetyStock` and `lowStock` fields while creating or updating either networks or inventory.

**3. Infinite Inventory Flag**

If you want to represent an inventory in unlimited quantities, you may set `infiniteInventory` to 'true' and reference that attribute on the storefront and other downstream systems consuming inventory from fabric.

#### Can I use fabric Inventory without using the fabric Orders module. If so, how?

Yes, fabric provides the flexibility of using only Inventory service independently without implementing the whole of fabric’s order management system into your business.

If you're not using the fabric Orders module, you must manually update the 'allocated' and 'shipped' counters using the [adjust inventory endpoint](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/inventory/adjust-inventory-counters) every time an order is created, allocated, and shipped. Similarly, you will have to update inventory records using the [update inventory endpoint](/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/inventory/inventory/update-inventory-by-adding-new-property). When updating the `onHand` counter, remember that the 'availableToPurchase' quantity is calculated based on the default formula `onHand - allocated - shipped - safetyStock`. Note that the `availableToPurchase` quantity can be customized based on requirement. Contact fabric Support to customize `availableToPurchase`.

#### How can I upload inventory data from multiple sources?

To upload inventory data from multiple sources, you must create an upload URL by using the bulk operation endpoint. Prepare a .csv file with all the inventory details from your POS, WMS, or other sources, then upload this file to the URL you have created.

fabric **Exports** API supports exporting data of different modules such as Orders, Locations, Allocations, Inventory, Invoices, Networks, Shipping\_Methods, and Aggregated\_Networks. fabric's Exports API lets you export module-specific data (saved in JSON format in the database) to a zip file. These zip files contain different CSV files where:

* Each field of a single JSON schema is a file header (also called column title) in the CSV file
* Each item of the JSON schema is a row in the CSV file

The data, in the database, are arranged as nested objects and arrays which are complex to use. fabric's Exports API simplifies the data of a single object by segregating them into multiple CSV files (by specific identifiers) for ease of use.

The following are the module (fabric service) names and its generated CSV files:

1\. Orders: order (exported by item), discount, logs, notes, payments, shipInfo\
2\. Allocations: allocation, logs\
3\. Shipments: shipment\
4\. Shipping\_Methods: shipping\_methods\
5\. Locations: location\
6\. Invoices: invoice, appeasements, discounts, payments\
7\. Inventory: inventory.

# Acknowledge shipment
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/orders-and-inventory/api-reference/orders/shipments/acknowledge-shipment

shipments.openapi post /shipments/{shipmentId}/acknowledge
For users of fabric Webhook Service, Shipment related events can trigger HTTP callbacks to notify web clients through a merchant-defined URL/URI, typically an API Gateway for a middleware. While the response to fabric Webhook service HTTP call-back may occur, a secondary call-back can use this Acknowledge Shipment endpoint to indicate that a secondary external system has acknowledged this shipment event. Middleware receives the event, transforms it in a suitable format, and sends a success response back to fabric, confirming it received the event. It also sends the transformed event to an external merchant system (typically in XML or JSON).<p>With this endpoint, middleware immediately sends an asynchronous acknowledgement to fabric, based on shipping ID, to indicate whether the call was successful. This acknowledgement is used for learning, auditing, and taking any necessary action.</p>

# API Authentication and Data Sync
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/api-authentication-data-sync



To ensure secure access to merchant data, fabric requires [authentication](/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/concepts) for all API requests. API apps generate API keys that validate permissions and define access rights, authorizing interactions between external applications and fabric services. There are two types of API apps:

* [System Apps](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/creating-system-app): Used for system-to-system authentication without requiring user credentials.

* [User Apps](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/creating-user-app): Used to authenticate end users through fabric Identity.

For more details on authentication and app types, see the [API Apps documentation](/v3/platform/settings/webhooks/overview).

Merchants can set up webhooks for real-time notifications on product updates, category changes, and collection assignments. These automated alerts enable seamless synchronization between fabric and external systems such as CMS platforms, third-party marketplaces, or ERP systems. Webhooks must be explicitly enabled and require an HTTP endpoint to receive event data. For details on configuring webhooks, see [Webhooks](/v3/platform/settings/webhooks/overview).


# Get Attribute Mapping
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attribute-mapping/get-attribute-mapping

attribute.openapi get /product-attribute-mappings
Before adding an item (with or without variants) to fabric **Product Catalog**, you must map merchant-specific attributes to fabric-specific attributes. <br /> Once mapping is created, this endpoint is used to get the mapping details.



# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attribute-mapping/overview



fabric has a predefined set of mandatory attributes for `Items` and `Categories`. However, as merchants, you may have your own naming conventions for these attributes. For instance, a mandatory attribute 'unique item identifier' may be referred to as `SKU` by fabric and as `productId` by merchant. To address this inconsistency, merchant-defined attributes are mapped to fabric attributes as productId -> fabric SKU. These endpoints are used to get and update mapping of attributes.


# Create an Attribute
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attributes/create-attribute

attribute.openapi post /product-attributes
In fabric **Product Catalog**, both products (Items, Variants, and Bundles) and categories have attributes. For products, they may be technical specifications like size, weight, etc., design specifications like color, material, etc. For Categories, they may be basic specifications such as name, description, ID, etc. This endpoint creates attributes that can be assigned to a `target` - Product or Category.

**Product Catalog** supports two types of attributes: Item Attributes and Category Attributes. Within fabric, a product could be an item, variant, or bundle. Product attributes are factual and objective descriptions that shoppers see when browsing through an e-commerce platform (website or mobile app). These attributes may include technical specifications such as size and weight, design specifications such as color and material, as well as basic details like name, description, and ID. Similarly, Category attributes define the characteristics of parent and children categories. They're essential for organizing products in logical groups, making it easier for shoppers to browse and find products on your platform with minimal cognitive load.

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/overview



Product Catalog APIs enable merchants to efficiently manage large-scale operations, such as importing thousands of products, updating attributes in bulk, and handling complex category assignments. By automating data updates through API-driven batch processing, merchants can maintain accuracy and consistency while significantly reducing manual workload.

Through these APIs, developers can integrate Product Catalog with external systems, streamline data management, and maintain accurate, up-to-date product information across sales channels. Product data can be created, modified, and retrieved efficiently using API calls, offering full feature parity with fabric’s Copilot interface.

## Workflow

The steps below highlight the core endpoints for integrating and managing Product Catalog. While they provide the foundation for catalog operations, there are numerous additional APIs to support custom use cases.

1. [Create Attributes](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attributes/create-attribute): Create the required attributes for the products. You can also use attribute groups to group relevant attributes and assign to products or categories.
2. [Map Attributes](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attributes-mapping/overview): Map the mandatory attributes of fabric, such SKU, title, image, and active status to the corresponding names provided by the merchant.
3. [Add Categories](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/categories/create-category): Arrange items, bundles, and variants into a hierarchical tree structure based on common attributes to logically group products.
4. Create Items, Variants, and Bundles: Add your products, which can consist of [items](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/general-product-operations/add-products), [bundles](/v3/guides/product-catalog/list/bundles/adding-a-bundle), [API documentation](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/product-operations-by-id/add-products-to-bundle-by-id), and [variants](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/product-operations-by-id/add-variants-to-products-by-id). Before adding any products, fabric recommends the following:
   * Maintain a list of attributes for products and categories.
   * Organize products within a hierarchical tree structure of categories.
   * Compile a products list, along with their variants and bundles, to display on the storefront.
5. [Create Collections](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/create-collection): Organize products according to marketing needs for display on your storefront. Collections are optional.

Once these steps are complete, basic setup is finished. You may proceed to use the features and capabilities available to you.


# Data Ingestion
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/data-ingestion



Optimized data management is at the core of every successful e-commerce operation. For fabric users managing extensive product catalogs, finely tuned data ingestion is paramount.

Adhering to fabric’s best practices will ensure the fastest processing speed, optimum resource management, and enhanced accuracy when importing your data.

This topic covers subjects such as file size restrictions, types of import actions, reconciling errors, and most importantly, the best method of data ingestion: **delta updates**.

## File Size and Upload Best Practices

Before you upload your first file, it's important to understand file size restrictions and how fabric handles files that exceed those restrictions.

* **No files larger than 300MB**
  Limit the size of your uploads to 300MB.
* **Split files larger than 300MB into smaller ones**
  Splitting large files into smaller ones before uploading them is the quickest way to import large amounts of data. For fastest processing, the ideal file size is between 80-100MB.
* **Parallel processing**
  fabric can process multiple files in parallel. The number of parallel files depends on your package. When the limit has been reached, subsequent files will be in a “scheduled” status until moved into the queue. Reach out to your account representative to learn more.
* **Automatic file chunking is available**
  fabric can automatically chunk files larger than 300MB into smaller files to improve performance. This feature is only available in select packages. Reach out to your account representative to learn more.

## Delta Updates

A delta update involves transmitting only the changed data fields when making an update. This is in contrast to the more traditional “full feed” updates that send the entire dataset. By sending only the changed data fields, fabric can process updates without reprocessing unchanged data.

**Delta updates are the preferred method for all uploads.**

### Delta updates vs. full feed updates

|                            | Full Feed Data Updates                                          | Delta Data Updates                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resource Usage**         | Requires more resources                                         | Requires fewer resources                                      |
| **Processing Time**        | Longer processing time                                          | Shorter processing time                                       |
| **Data Transmission**      | Transmits entire dataset                                        | Transmits only modified data fields                           |
| **Network Bandwidth**      | Consumes more network bandwidth                                 | Requires less network bandwidth                               |
| **Storage**                | Requires more storage space                                     | Requires less storage space                                   |
| **Error Handling**         | Prone to errors during full data transmission                   | Less prone to errors due to focused updates                   |
| **Scalability**            | Less scalable for large datasets                                | More scalable, especially for large datasets                  |
| **Data Accuracy**          | Potential for data redundancy and inconsistency                 | Enhances data accuracy by focusing on changes                 |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Lower operational efficiency due to higher resource consumption | Higher operational efficiency due to optimized resource usage |
| **Incremental Updates**    | Updates entire dataset each time                                | Updates only modified data fields incrementally               |

## Ways to Import Data

You can import data into fabric using the following methods:

* CSV import using API
* Import using RESTful APIs
* CSV import using the Copilot interface

The import method you choose is up to you, but in each case, uploading smaller files and using the delta update method will result in quicker processing, better resource management, and a higher degree of accuracy.

## Data Formatting

It's crucial to make sure your dataset is accurate and compatible with fabric’s formatting before initiating the upload process. Validate your data to avoid errors by reviewing the file to identify any changes since the last upload and confirm that the data structure and format are correct. See the following pages for formatting guidelines:

* [Importing Items](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/importing-items#csv-file-guidelines)
* [Importing Bundles](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/bundles/importing-bundles#csv-file-guidelines)
* [Importing Product Attributes](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/importing-product-attributes#attribute-data-formatting)
* [Importing Categories](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/importing-categories#csv-file-guidelines)

## Import Actions

The actions you use when importing items, bundles, categories, and collections tell fabric how you are modifying your data. The following actions are available:

* **UPSERT:** Creates a new product if the product doesn't exist, or it updates an existing product.
* **CREATE:** Creates a new product.
* **UPDATE:** Updates existing product.
* **PUBLISH:** Publishes an existing product that was in draft state. The product is published to the storefront.
* **UNPUBLISH\_KEEP\_DRAFT:** Unpublishes an existing product. If the product already has a draft version, the live version is unpublished and discarded. If product doesn't already have a draft version, the live version is unpublished and saved as a draft.
* **UNPUBLISH\_KEEP\_LIVE:** Unpublishes an existing product. If the product already has a draft version, the draft version is discarded.
* **DELETE:** Deletes the existing product.
* **ATTACH\_VARIANT:** Adds variants to an existing parent product. The variant column holds the variant to be attached to the SKU.
* **DETACH\_VARIANT:** Detaches existing variants. The variant column holds the variant to be detached from the SKU.
* **CHANGE\_CATEGORY:** Updates the category of existing product.
* **ATTACH\_CHANNELS:** Appends listed channels to the product, allowing it to be available across various sales channels. You can specify the channels to be attached in the Channels column. After attaching channels, users should verify the attachment post-action to confirm the successful addition of channels to the product.
* **DETACH\_CHANNELS:** Removes listed channels from a product. Users specify the channels to be detached in the Channels column. This action is useful when a product needs to be removed from specific sales channels while remaining available on others. Users should verify the detachment of channels post-action to ensure the desired channels are removed from the product.

## Reconciling Errors

If there are errors during processing, download the error file and review each error to identify the problem. Correct the errors by updating the CSV file with the necessary changes and validate the corrected CSV file before re-importing.

* [Troubleshooting Item Imports](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/importing-items#troubleshooting)
* [Troubleshooting Bundle Imports](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/bundles/importing-bundles#troubleshooting)


# Getting Started
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/getting-started



fabric Product Catalog is a data organization tool that enables merchants to build a centralized source of product information. This information can include technical specifications such as size and weight, design specifications such as color and material, and generic details such as name, description, and ID.

Product Catalog has out-of-the-box integrations with fabric services such as [Orders](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/overview) and [Offers](/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/overview) that enable merchants to add base prices and promotions to any products available in Product Catalog, including categories and collections.

Product Catalog is accessible through fabric’s cloud-based application [Copilot](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/overview), or through fabric's [APIs](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/overview).

## Use Case

Consider a furniture distributor with an extensive catalog that includes living, dining, and bedroom pieces who wants to display their products for sale on their storefront.

The merchant can upload each item they sell, either individually or in bulk with a CSV file. Attributes of each piece, ranging from physical characteristics such as dimensions and weight to construction characteristics such as materials and finishes can all be included. Variants of items are also supported, so that a coffee table available in mahogany, oak, and pine can all be considered different versions of the same item. In addition, items frequently sold together can be grouped into bundles so that the coffee table can be sold along with a pair of matching end tables.

The merchant can then create a hierarchy of relationships among the items in the catalog that make the most sense to their business. That means the coffee table could be in a category with all living room furniture, or a category of all tables, or both.

The merchant can group items from different categories into themed collections to boost the sales or marketing campaigns. For example, for a Black Friday promotion, merchant can assemble a living room set collection that includes a coffee table, end tables, sofa, loveseat, and lamps.

After adopting fabric Product Catalog:

* Real-time APIs serve live product data to all channels.
* Webhooks automatically update search and recommendation engines when product data changes.
* Export APIs populate CMS and promotional content with up-to-date product info.
* Launching in a new region requires only a new export config—no custom code.

This reduces engineering costs, improves product consistency across channels, and speeds up time to market.

## Outcome

* **Storefront API throughput:** Real-time endpoints ensure high performance and availability under load.
* **Software cost reduction:** Fewer custom integrations to build and maintain.


# Enrich Product Data for Optimized Sales Channel Performance
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/use-cases/enrich-product-data



## Problem

As a retailer, you may be enriching product data manually by copying and pasting between systems, reformatting content, and relying on team-specific processes. This results in inconsistent listings, slower time-to-market, and higher error rates across sales channels.

Common limitations include:

* No standardized validation of required fields.
* Manual processes prone to human error.
* Lack of a centralized system for enrichment across teams.
* Difficulty optimizing product content for different sales channels.

## Solution

With fabric Product Catalog, you can enrich product data with precision and scale. Using structured schemas, validations, formulas, and AI-powered content, you can ensure every product is channel-ready before publishing.

### Key capabilities

* Configure attributes globally, by category, or by individual product.
* Attribute formulas that auto-generate values like product names, weights, and sizes.
* Update multiple products in bulk with CSV imports.
* Tailor product descriptions for SEO, channel standards, and brand voice with Product Catalog AI.

## Example Scenario

A home goods retailer sells through three channels: a branded ecommerce site, Amazon, and regional marketplaces in North America. Each channel has unique requirements:

* Amazon: Structured specs with character limits.
* DTC site: SEO-optimized, brand-aligned copy.
* Marketplaces: Localized content and unit conversions.

Previously, the team managed product content through spreadsheets, resulting in frequent listing rejections, inconsistent messaging, and long lead times.

With fabric Product Catalog:

* A global data structure supports both universal and channel-specific attributes.
* Calculations populate attributes, such as volume or weight.
* AI tools generate channel-specific descriptions.
* Validations ensure required fields are completed before publishing.
* Bulk tools streamline mass edits and updates.

## Outcome

* **Higher data accuracy:** Fewer errors across channels.
* **Reduced manual work:** Bulk and AI tools speed up enrichment.
* **Improved conversion:** Optimized listings drive better customer engagement.
* **Lower return rates:** Accurate, tailored content reduces buyer confusion.


# Merchandising Products through Automated Collections
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/use-cases/merchandise-products



## Problem

Manually managing product collections for site navigation, seasonal campaigns, and sales efforts is time-consuming and error-prone. You may often rely on spreadsheets and manual tagging, which disconnects collections from real-time product updates and slows down execution.

Common challenges include:

* Manually applying merchandising rules for each campaign.
* Pulling product data from multiple, inconsistent sources.
* Repeating work for every seasonal update.
* Increased risk of outdated or miscategorized listings.

## Solution

With fabric Product Catalog, you can create automated, rule-based collections. These collections dynamically update based on product data, reducing the need for manual changes and ensuring accurate, timely merchandising across storefronts.

### Key capabilities

* Build collections with rule-based logic using attributes like category, brand, availability, or season.
* Collections refresh automatically as product data changes.
* Use flexible targeting to fine-tune inclusion criteria.
* Export collections to CMS, search engines, and other platforms.

## Example Scenario

A lifestyle retailer frequently runs seasonal campaigns such as “Spring Refresh” and “Back to School.” Previously, merchandisers pulled SKUs from ERP into spreadsheets, manually tagged them, and relied on developers to upload and configure listings in the CMS—a process that was slow and error-prone.

With fabric:

* Merchandisers create a dynamic “Spring Refresh” collection using the rules `season = spring` and `availability = true`. As new products are added or inventory updates roll in, the collection stays current automatically.
* For site navigation, they create collections like “Dining Room Essentials” by filtering products with `room = dining` or `use_case = outdoor`.

These collections are synced to the CMS and used for banners, homepage curation, and navigation menus without requiring custom code or manual updates.

## Outcome

* **Faster time-to-launch:** Rule-based logic eliminates repetitive setup work.
* **Improved product discovery:** Targeted, dynamic groupings improve visibility.
* **Higher conversion:** Relevant collections lead to more shopper engagement.

# Category Attributes Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/category-attributes-overview



## Overview

Category attributes define specific characteristics of a category or collection, such as images and SEO tags. Category attributes added to higher-level categories are inherited by subcategories. Category attributes are inherited by default, meaning sub-collection nodes automatically adopt attribute values from their parent categories. However, users can override these values as needed, allowing for customization at different hierarchy levels.

## Attribute Types

fabric supports the following attribute types for storing category information:

* **Text:** A sequence of characters. You may store any combination of text, numbers, or special characters. Text attribute has three subtypes:
  * Small text: For single-line text attributes.
  * Text Area: For multi-line text attributes.
  * HTML: For text area attributes that support HTML.
* **Number Only:** An attribute type for values that are always a number.
* **Date:** All date-related formats. Bulk import of the date attribute uses the date format selected when the attribute was created. Once selected, the date format can't be changed. If the format needs to be changed, you must delete the attribute and create it again using the required format.
* **Boolean:** A Boolean value (true/false) for a category attribute. While importing attributes from an external system, make sure the true or false values are specified for all Boolean attribute types.

For each attribute type, certain fields are optional, while others are required. Failure to provide required fields will result in an "Unable to create attribute" error message.

The following table shows the attribute types and their properties. This will help you determine the mandatory and optional properties of an attribute type. To ensure data quality, set up one or more validations based on the selected attribute type.

| Attribute Type | Localize this attribute | Attribute title | Description | Use JavaScript to calculate value | Validations | Is this attribute mandatory? | Type of text | Date Format | Decimal  |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Text           | Optional                | Required        | Optional    | Optional                          | Optional    | Required                     | Required     | N/A         | N/A      |
| Number Only    | Optional                | Required        | Optional    | Optional                          | Optional    | Required                     | N/A          | N/A         | Optional |
| Date           | Optional                | Required        | Optional    | Optional                          | Optional    | Required                     | N/A          | Required    | N/A      |
| Boolean        | Optional                | Required        | Optional    | Optional                          | Optional    | Required                     | N/A          | N/A         | N/A      |

<Note>After creating a category attribute, you cannot modify its attribute type. If you want to use a different attribute type, you must create a new category attribute with the required type.</Note>

# Importing Product Attributes
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/importing-product-attributes



## Overview

Product attributes are specific product descriptors that define characteristics such as size, color, or material. This document covers the process of importing multiple product attributes using a CSV file. You also have the option to add product attributes manually.

## CSV File Guidelines

Product attributes can be imported using CSV files exclusively, as fabric doesn't support other data or file formats. Here are some essential points to keep in mind:

* The headers in the first row of the CSV file should match the attribute titles.
* While attribute titles aren't case-sensitive, maintaining case consistency with the original attribute titles is recommended.
* Empty rows and columns are ignored.
* fabric recommends downloading the template file to serve as a guide when creating your own CSV file for import, minimizing errors during the process.

### Attribute data formatting

When preparing your CSV file for import, ensure that the product attribute data format aligns with the column requirements. Different columns have specific data input requirements:

| **Attribute**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

# Product Attributes Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/product-attributes-overview



## Overview

Item attributes are used to define product characteristics. For example, a product name, an identity number, and a product description are all common attributes of a product.

Attributes are key-value pairs, such as *Color: red*, that hold information for each property of the product. ‌

## Attribute Types

fabric supports the following types of attributes for storing product information:

* **Text:** A sequence of characters. You may store any combination of text, numbers, or special characters. Text attribute has three subtypes:
  * Small text: For single-line text attributes.
  * Text Area: For multi-line text attributes.
  * HTML: For text area attributes that support HTML.
* **Number Only:** An attribute type for values that are always a number.
* **Date:** All date-related formats. Bulk import of the date attribute uses the date format selected when the attribute was created. Once selected, the date format can't be changed. If the format needs to be changed, you must delete the attribute and create it again using the required format.
* **Boolean:** A Boolean value (true/false) for a product attribute. While importing attributes from an external system, make sure the true or false values are specified for all Boolean attribute types.
* **List of Values:** A dropdown menu for product attributes that have defined values across the product list. Supports single selection or multiple selection from the dropdown.
* **Serial:** An auto increment number-type attribute. You can specify the starting number and what the increment is.

The following table shows the attribute types and their properties. This will help you determine the mandatory and optional properties of an attribute type. To ensure data quality, set up one or more validations based on the selected attribute type.

| **Attributes**                    | **Text** | **Number Only** | **Date** | **Boolean** | **List of Values** | **Serial** |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | --------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Attribute title                   | Required | Required        | Required | Required    | Required           | Required   |
| Description                       | Optional | Optional        | Optional | Optional    | Optional           | Optional   |
| Use JavaScript to calculate value | Optional | Optional        | Optional | Optional    | Optional           | N/A        |
| Validations                       | Optional | Optional        | Optional | Optional    | Optional           | N/A        |
| Is this attribute mandatory?      | Required | Required        | Required | Required    | Required           | Required   |
| Type of text                      | Required | N/A             | N/A      | N/A         | N/A                | N/A        |
| Date Format                       | N/A      | N/A             | Required | N/A         | N/A                | N/A        |
| Decimal                           | N/A      | Optional        | N/A      | N/A         | N/A                | N/A        |
| Type of list                      | N/A      | N/A             | N/A      | N/A         | Required           | N/A        |

<Note>After creating a category attribute, you cannot modify its attribute type. If you want to use a different attribute type, you must create a new product attribute with the required type.</Note>

## Calculation Formulas

Businesses often require dynamically calculated attributes based on existing values. For example:

1. You can configure a product's display name to be *Product Name* + *by* + *Brand Name*, Instead of naming each product or variant individually. This formula automatically creates names for the products.
2. The area of a rug can be calculated by multiplying width with length and the price per square foot can be calculated by dividing the price attribute value by the area attribute value.
3. You can calculate weight per count by dividing the weight of the product by the total count of items inside the box.

With low-code JavaScript formulas, these attribute values can be calculated automatically. Here are some frequently used formulas:

| Operation   | Calculation Formula                                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Divide      | `(async ()=> await attribute('attribute 1 ID') / await attribute('volume'))() `                          |
| Multiply    | `(async ()=> await attribute('attribute ID') \* 10)()`                                                   |
| Sum         | `(async ()=> await attribute('attribute 1 ID') + await attribute('attribute 2 ID'))() `                  |
| Subtract    | `(async ()=> await attribute('attribute 1 ID') - await attribute('attribute 2 ID'))()`                   |
| Concatenate | `(async ()=> await attribute('attribute 1 ID') + " followed by " + await attribute('attribute 2 ID'))()` |

Note that the values in double quotes (`" "`) represent the title of the reference attribute and refer to the absolute value of the attribute being used for calculation.

## Validation Formulas

you can specify business validations on attributes using a low-code JavaScript formula and ensure data integrity and quality. This operation doesn't manipulate data, only validates fields for the attributes.

| Validation Type                              | Validation Formula                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Number Validation                            | `(async ()=> await attribute() >=0 && await attribute()<=20 && await attribute()%0.25 === 0)()` |
| String Validation                            | `(async ()=> (await attribute()).length < 200)()`                                               |
| Date (Greater than Equal to current Date)    | `(async ()=> await attribute() >= new Date())()`                                                |
| Date (Greater than Equal to particular Date) | `(async ()=> await attribute() >= new Date('02/14/2021'))()`                                    |

Formulas are based on JavaScript syntax, so you can use all inbuilt JavaScript functions.

For example, values given as a string can be stored as integers by using formulas such as `(async () => parseFloat(await attribute('Height (in)')) - parseFloat(await attribute('Weight (in)')) )()`.

# Adding a Category
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/adding-a-category



### Overview

Categories are hierarchical tree structures that allow you to organize items, variants, and bundles into groups based on similar attributes. This document covers how to create a single category using the Copilot interface. You can also add multiple categories at the same time by [importing them](/v3/guides/product-catalog/categories/importing-categories) using a CSV file.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have access to the **Product Catalog** in Copilot. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control).

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > Categories**.\
   The Categories page is displayed.
2. Click the **+** icon.
3. Enter a title for the new category and press **Enter** or click the **?** icon.\
   The new category is created.
4. (Optional) Click the new category name, and then click the **+** icon on the right to create a new subcategory.\
   The new subcategory is created.

When you click a root category, all subcategories within the root category are displayed at the right. A **leaf** label is used to indicate any category or subcategory that doesn't contain a subcategory.

# Importing Categories
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/importing-categories



Categories are hierarchical tree structures that allow you to organize items, variants, and bundles into groups based on similar attributes. This document covers the process of importing multiple categories using a CSV file. You can also [add categories individually](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/adding-a-category).

## CSV File Guidelines

You can import categories using CSV files only, fabric doesn't support any other data or file formats. Here are the key points to consider:

* The headers, represented in the first row of the CSV file, should match the attributes of the category.
* While category titles aren't case-sensitive, maintaining case consistency with the original category titles is recommended.
* Empty rows and columns are ignored.
* fabric recommends that you download the template file to use as a guide when creating your own CSV file for import to minimize errors during the import process.

## Category Data Formatting

When preparing your CSV file for import, ensure that the category data format aligns with the column requirements. Different columns have specific data input requirements:

| **Header**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

# Managing Categories
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/managing-categories



## Overview

Categories are hierarchical tree structures that allow you to organize items, variants, and bundles into groups based on similar attributes. This document covers the process of adding attributes to categories, renaming categories, and deleting categories.

## Adding Product Attributes

### Overview

Item attributes are the attributes that an item, also called a product, must have configured in order to be added to a category.

Individual item attributes are set up in the Attributes section. Those product attributes can then be added to a category using the procedure below.

As an example, a home décor company might have a category for rugs and want to require any items added to that category to have length and width information. The attributes for dimensions would be set up in **Product Catalog > Attributes > Product** and then added to a category in **Product Catalog > Categories**.

It's required to set up a category’s product attributes prior to adding any items to it. If a category is missing item attributes, no item can be created for that category.

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > Categories**.\
   The **Categories** page is displayed.
2. Mouse over the desired category and click the vertical ellipses (**⋮**) at the right.
3. Click **Product attributes**.\
   The **Product attributes** menu is displayed.
4. Click the **Add Product Attributes** dropdown.\
   The dropdown displays a list of category attributes as created in **Product Catalog > Attributes > Product**.
5. To add an attribute, click its corresponding checkbox.

Note that system-mandatory attributes are separated for easier management. These attributes are shown by default, but need to be saved so that you can add to the category.
<Note>You can add as many attributes as needed up to a maximum of 60 attributes per each session. If you want to add more attributes, you must click **Save** and repeat this step.  </Note>
6\. (Optional) To the right of a product attribute, click the vertical ellipses (**⋮**) and do the following:

* To make the attribute mandatory, click **Make attribute mandatory**.
* To remove the attribute, click **Remove attribute**.

7. Click **Save**.

The category attributes you selected are applied to the category and all its subcategories.

## Adding Category Attributes

### Overview

Category attributes allow you to apply a group of attributes to your category hierarchy. These attribute groups are set up in **Product Catalog > Attributes > Category**.

You can apply category attributes at the root level of your category hierarchy or at the subcategory level.

Subcategories inherit the category attributes applied to the parent category unless you select a different group of category attributes at the subcategory level.

### Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > Categories**.\
   The Categories page is displayed.
2. On the desired category click the vertical ellipses (**⋮**) at the right.
   To apply category attributes to the entire category hierarchy, click the vertical ellipses to the right of the Root menu.
3. Click **Category attributes**.\
   The **Category Attributes** menu is displayed.
4. Click the **Add Category Attributes** dropdown.
   The dropdown menu displays a list of category attributes that are created in the **Product Catalog > Attributes > Category** page.
5. To add an attribute, click its corresponding checkbox.
   <Note>You can add up to 60 attributes per session. To add more attributes, you must click **Save** and repeat this step.</Note>
6. Click **Save**.

The category attributes that you selected are applied to the category and its subcategories.

## Removing Attributes from Category

You can remove category attributes at the root level of your category hierarchy or at the subcategory level.

<Note>With the following procedure, you can remove one attribute at a time. To update or remove multiple attributes at once, [import an attributes CSV](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/importing-categories) file for categories. The import process overwrites existing data, so any attributes not included in the file will be removed.</Note>

### Removing a category attribute

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > Categories**.\
   The **Categories** page is displayed.
2. Click the vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) on the right of the category that you want to modify.
   To remove category attributes from the entire category hierarchy, click the vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) next to the **Root** menu.
3. Click **Category attributes**.\
   The **Category attributes** window is displayed.
4. In the **Category Attributes** section, click the vertical ellipsis (**⋮**) next to the attribute you want to remove.
5. Click **Remove attribute**.
6. Click **Save**.

The category attribute is removed from the category.

## Removing a product attribute

<Note>Product attributes inherited from a parent category can't be removed at the subcategory level. To remove them, you must remove them from the parent category.</Note>

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > Categories**.\
   The **Categories** page is displayed.

# Categories
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/overview



Categories define the structure of product organization within **Product Catalog**, allowing merchants to group products logically based on shared attributes. Using a hierarchical tree structure, categories help create navigable and scalable product groupings.

Each product in Product Catalog, whether an item, a variant, or a bundle, must be assigned to a category or subcategory when it's created. A product can only be assigned to one category or subcategory at a time.

There is no limit to the number of categories or subcategories you can create.

## Tree Analogy

Categories and subcategories can be best explained with the tree analogy. For instance, consider *furniture* as the main category or root, the branches are subcategories such as *tables* and *chairs*, and the leaves represent individual products. In this example, a leaf could be an oak dining table that seats four. Visually, it looks like this:

> * Root: Furniture
>   * Branch: Tables
>     * Leaf: Dining Tables
>       * Product: Oak dining table seating 4
>       * Product: Oak dining table seating 6
>     * Leaf: Coffee Tables
>       * Product: Oak coffee table
>       * Product: Oak coffee table, glass top
>   * Branch: Chairs
>     * Leaf: Dining Chairs
>       * Product: Oak dining chair
>       * Product: Oak dining chair, with arms
>     * Leaf: Office Chairs
>       * Product: Computer chair
>       * Product: Computer chair, reclining

Any attribute applied to a category is inherited by its subcategories, known as attribute inheritance. However, inherited attributes can be overwritten by assigning the attribute to the subcategory itself. For example, the broad *office chairs* category could have a *material* attribute set to *leather*, but a specific subcategory could be set to *nylon*.

# Collections
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/collections/collections



Collections in Product Catalog are a flexible tool to group products to meet dynamic merchandising purposes on a storefront. Unlike categories, which provide a fixed, hierarchical structure, collections reflect flexible grouping of products for display on a storefront based on specific themes, promotions, or attributes.

Collections enable you to aggregate products from multiple categories. You can further refine the curated list based on attributes.

## Key Features of Collections

* **Dynamic Grouping**: After the rules for a collection are defined, you don't need to refresh or re-run the collection to have an accurate list of products when the catalog is refreshed. When new products are added to the catalog or existing products are updated to match collection rules, they will appear in the collection automatically.

* **Attribute-based Rules**: You can set up collections by defining rules based on product attributes , for example price range, brand, or availability. This allows for precise targeting and segmentation, helping you create custom displays that align with merchandising strategies.

## Collections vs Categories

While both collections and categories help organize products, they serve different purposes:

* [Categories](/v3/guides/product-catalog/categories/categories_overview) provide a foundational, static structure for products, making it easier for users to navigate a catalog in a structured, hierarchical way. For example, *Furniture > Living Room > Sofas*.
* Collections offer flexibility, allowing you to aggregate products from multiple categories into a single, curated list, perfect for promotional or thematic displays on a storefront. For example, a page on the storefront could showcase items from all categories made by a specific manufacturer, or a sale on sectional sofas.

## Attributes & Values

When creating a collection, the first step is selecting one or more categories that contain the products you want to include. This establishes the initial pool of products that the collection will draw from.

After selecting categories, you can refine the included products with the **Attributes & Values** menu. This menu allows you to create the conditions and rules, which define the specific [product attributes](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/product-attributes-overview) that a product must meet to be included in the collection.

Each condition consists of the following:

* A product attribute such as color, brand, or size.
* A validation option, such as "is equal to" or "greater than."
* A value such as "red" for color or "medium" for size.

Product attributes and values are user-specified, but the validation options are fabric-generated. The following table lists the validation options:

| **Validation Option**   | **Description**                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Is equal to**         | The product attribute must match the specified value exactly.              |
| **Is greater than**     | The product attribute must be greater than the specified value.            |
| **Is less than**        | The product attribute must be less than the specified value.               |
| **Includes**            | The product attribute must include the specified value.                    |
| **Excludes**            | The product attribute must exclude the specified value.                    |
| **Contains**            | The product attribute must contain a partial match to the specified value. |
| **Contains exact word** | The product attribute must contain the exact word specified.               |
| **Does not contain**    | The product attribute must not include the specified value.                |
| **Is exact match**      | The product attribute must match the specified value exactly.              |
| **Yes**                 | The product attribute must be marked as *true*.                            |
| **No**                  | The product attribute must be marked as *false*.                           |

A rule is formed by combining multiple conditions. The relationships between conditions within a rule are governed by *AND* and *OR* operators so that you can create precise inclusion or exclusion rules.

For example, a rule with conditions based on *AND* logic might require that a product be large and green and made in the USA. A rule with conditions that include *OR* logic might require that a product be large and green or blue.

A collection can contain up to five rules, with each rule containing up to five conditions. Rules can only be joined together with an *AND* operator.

## Use Cases

A furniture store with a diverse range of products needs to drive sales by promoting specific types of sofas from its extensive Product Catalog. While the store’s catalog is organized by broad categories, such as *Sofas*, these general categories don’t effectively highlight certain products for promotional events. The store wants to feature only a select type of sofa within its broad Sofas category to align with current market trends and customer interests.

The following use cases demonstrate two scenarios: one in which conditions are joined with the *AND* operator, and another in which conditions are joined with the *OR* operator.

### Scenario 1: Creating a targeted sofa collection with AND operators

In this scenario, the store wants to create a collection of sofas that meet all specified conditions, narrowing down the selection to a precise product type for a focused promotion. The goal is to quickly create a collection of sofas that are:

* *Sectional* in style
* *Not powered*
* Not made of *leather*
* Manufactured by *Top Brand*
* Belonging to the *Windham* product line

Using a collection, the store can set up this sale within the *Sofas* category by applying a single rule with multiple conditions that precisely define the products to be included. Here’s how each condition helps narrow down the products in the category to create a tailored collection:

* Condition 1
  * Product Attribute: *Style*
  * Validation Option: *Is exact match*
  * Value: *Sectional*

* Condition 2
  * Product Attribute: *Powered*
  * Validation Option: *Is equal to*
  * Value: *False*

* Condition 3
  * Product Attribute: *Material*
  * Validation Option: *Does not contain*
  * Value: *Leather*

* Condition 4
  * Product Attribute: *Brand*
  * Validation Option: *Includes*
  * Value: *Top Brand*

* Condition 5
  * Product Attribute: *Line*
  * Validation Option: *Includes*
  * Value: *Windham*

In this collection, *AND* logic is used across all conditions, ensuring that the included products are sectional sofas that are non-powered, non-leather, and exclusively from the Windham line by Top Brand.

### Scenario 2: Expanding a sofa collection with OR operators

In this scenario, the store wants to broaden the selection for a promotion by including sofas that meet at least one of several material options, allowing for greater flexibility. The goal is to create a collection of sofas that are:

* *Sectional* in style
* Made of *leather*
* Made of *microfiber*

Here’s how each condition would be structured to create this broader collection:

* Condition 1
  * Product Attribute: *Style*
  * Validation Option: *Is exact match*
  * Value: *Sectional*

* Condition 2
  * Product Attribute: *Material*
  * Validation Option: *Is equal to*
  * Value: *Leather*

* Condition 3
  * Product Attribute: *Material*
  * Validation Option: *Is equal to*
  * Value: *Microfiber*

In this collection, *AND* logic is used between Conditions 1 and 2, with *OR* logic joining Conditions 2 and 3, ensuring that the included products are sectional sofas that are either leather or microfiber.

# Creating a Collection
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/collections/creating-a-collection



This topic covers the process of creating a collection.

Collections are most effective when you’ve fully configured your Product Catalog elements. Before creating a collection, it’s helpful to have the following in place:

* [Product Attributes](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/product-attributes-overview): Setting up product attributes enables you to refine collections based on these specific product characteristics, such as style, material, or brand.

* [Products](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/items): Adding products and [assigning product attributes to them](/v3/guides/product-catalog/list/items/adding-an-item) ensures that collections capture the right products.

* [Categories](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/overview): Organizing your products into categories provides a foundation for building collections and makes it easier to select relevant products.

With these elements set up, you’ll be able to create targeted collection conditions and rules in the **Attributes & Values** menu.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have **Admin** or **Editor** privileges for Product Catalog. For more detailed information on these settings, see [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-products-roles).

# Importing Collections
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/collections/importing-collections



Collections serve as an alternative to categories for organizing products, especially useful for short-term merchandising campaigns. This topic covers the process of importing multiple collections with a CSV file. You can also add collections individually.

We highly recommend that you download the template file to use as a guide when creating your CSV file for import to minimize errors during the import process.

### CSV File Guidelines

You can import collections using CSV files only; Product Catalog doesn't support any other data or file formats. Here are the key points to consider:

* The headers, represented in the first row of the CSV file, should match the attributes of the collection.
* While collection titles aren't case-sensitive, maintaining case consistency with the original collection titles is recommended.
* Empty rows and columns are ignored.

### Collection Data Formatting

When preparing your CSV file for import, ensure that the collection data format aligns with the column requirements. Different columns have specific data input requirements:

* **Action:** Accepts one of the following commands:
  * Create adds a new collection.
  * Update replaces the details of an existing collection.
  * Upsert creates a new collection or replaces the details of an existing collection. Note that if no action is specified for a row, upsert is considered the default.
* **Node ID:** Represents the Collection ID.
* **Parent Collection:** Unless you are creating a primary or root collection, specify the parent category for the new collection you want to create or update.
* **Node Name:** Name of the root, branch, or leaf collection that you are creating or updating.
* **Order:** The order in which a given collection must appear among sibling collections. If multiple collections are assigned the same order, the newly added collections appear in alphabetical order.
* **Category Attributes:** Attributes that are assigned to the Collection.
* **Categories Included:** Categories to include when creating the collection.
* **Categories Excluded:** Categories to exclude when creating the collection.
* **Product Attribute Filters:** Attribute conditions that filter the eligible products for the Collection node. Filter operations are dependent on the attribute type.

| Attribute Type | Available Operations                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Text           | Contains, Doesn't contain, Is exact match  |
| Number         | Is equal to, Is less than, Is greater than |
| List of Value  | Includes, Excludes                         |
| Boolean        | Yes, No                                    |
| Date           | Is equal to, Is less than, Is greater than |
| Serial         | Is equal to, Is less than, Is greater than |

### Example file

| Action | Node Id        | Parent Category             | Node Name         | Order | Category Attributes      | Categories Included                  | Categories Excluded | Product Attribute Filters                      |   |   |

# Bundles Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/bundles/bundles



Bundles are combinations of two or more products sold exclusively together or individually, depending on the configuration. Pure bundles consist of items exclusively sold together, and individual items can't be purchased separately. Shoppers have the flexibility to buy items in mixed bundles together or separately.

For example, in a living room furniture set consisting of a coffee table and an end table, shoppers can choose to purchase each table individually or buy both tables together as part of the *living room set* bundle.

Bundles must be assigned to one [category or subcategory](v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/overview.mdx) when they're created.

This document covers the process of adding multiple bundles through CSV import. You can also [add a single bundle](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/bundles/adding-a-bundle).

## CSV File Guidelines

You can import bundles using CSV files only; no other data or file formats are supported. Here are the key points to consider:

* Formulas in formula-driven attributes are executed automatically after bundles have been imported.
* If the CSV file doesn't have an attribute that's added to the category, you can add a new column in the CSV with the attribute name in the header. The upload process will populate the value for this attribute. Note that empty rows and columns are ignored.
* Each bundle should include a category node. If the category node is missing, the bundle won't be created.
* Use the **- >** delimiter for category nodes. Incorrect mapping or absence of category nodes may result in bundle creation issues.
* The headers, represented in the first row of the CSV file, should match the attributes of the bundle. While attribute titles aren't case-sensitive, maintaining case consistency with the original attribute titles is recommended.
* Empty rows and columns are ignored.
* When updating or upserting bundles, entering *NULL* in a spreadsheet cell will override existing values with blank values.
* The ActionTarget field determines what action is being taken for that row of data.

We recommend that you download the template file to use as a guide when creating your own CSV file for import to minimize errors during the import process.

### Attribute data format

When preparing your CSV file for import, ensure that the attribute data format aligns with attribute type requirements. Different attribute types have specific formatting criteria:

| **Data Type**      | **Format Rule**                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**           | Ensure the data is in text string format.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Number**         | Use numerical data only. All non-numeric data is ignored.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Boolean**        | Use *TRUE* or *FALSE* only. All other values are ignored.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Date**           | Format dates exactly as during attribute creation.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **List of values** | The value you enter must match one of the predefined values you set up when [adding a list of values attribute](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/adding-a-list-of-values-attribute). |
| **Serial**         | Leave this field blank; fabric automatically generates the serial number during import.                                                                                                                        |

The status attribute is imported as live only when all mandatory attributes are provided for the bundle. Otherwise, the status is automatically updated to draft, regardless of the value you provide in the file.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the bundle import, ensure that:

* You have created at least one leaf category with attributes assigned to it to add the bundle to. For more information about creating categories, see the [Categories section](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/adding-a-category).
* The CSV file adheres to the guidelines.

## Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > List > Bundles**.\
   The **Bundles** page is displayed.

2. Click **Import**.\
   The **Select a leaf category** window is displayed.

3. Select a **Leaf**.\
   The root categories and leaf categories appear as they're set up in Categories. Depending on your configuration, you may have to select one or more root categories before selecting a leaf category.

4. Click **Next**.\
   The **Import CSV file** window is displayed. This window provides a link to download an example template for the CSV file.

5. To import a CSV file, do one of the following options:
   * Drag and drop the CSV file into the window.
   * Click **Select a File from your computer**.

6. Click **Import file**.

The CSV file is imported, and the bundles are added to your product list.

fabric stores the CSV files you upload to your account. You can view the status of the import and re-download the original files by visiting the [Background Jobs](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/background-jobs/background-jobs) page.

# Searching, Filtering, and Sorting Bundles
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/bundles/searching-filtering-sorting-bundles



The search, filter, and sort options on the **Bundles** page allows you to refine the3 list of bundles or find a specific bundle.

You can use the filter option only if you have multiple bundles in your list and the bundles belong to multiple categories and collections with different attributes and values.

### To search for one or more bundles, do the following:

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > List > Bundles**.<br />
   The Bundles page is displayed.
2. Type a search term into the search bar.<br />
   When searching, keep in mind the following:
   * You can search for multiple bundles by typing multiple search terms into the search bar, each separated by a comma.
   * When searching for multiple bundles, the search terms must be exact. Partial entries yield no results.
   * In addition to typing your searches into the search bar, you can also paste them.
3. Press **Enter**.<br />
   The results are displayed.

### To filter the list of bundles, do the following:

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > List > Bundles**.
   The **Bundles** page is displayed.
2. Choose at least one of the following filters:
   * Click the **Category** dropdown and select a category.
   * Click the **Collection** dropdown and select a collection.
   * Click the **Date** dropdown and select a date range for the date the bundle was created and/or the date the bundles were modified.
   * Click the **Attributes & Values** dropdown.
     * Select a value to filter by in the **If** field.
     * Select a **Validation** option.
     * Enter a value in the **Value** field.
     * (Optional) Click **Add new condition** to filter by another attribute or value.

Bundles that match the filters you chose are displayed.

Click **Reset filters** to remove all filters.

### To sort the list of bundles, do the following:

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > List > Bundles**.\
   The **Bundles** page is displayed.
2. Click one of the column headers to sort the list of bundles.\
   Sortable headers are SKU, Product name, Category, Created, and Status.

The bundles are sorted.

# Adding an Item
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/adding-an-item



Items, which are also referred to as products, are services or stand-alone items sold individually. This document covers the process of adding an individual item to your list of products. You can also add multiple items at the same time by [importing](/v3/guides/product-catalog/list/items/importing-items) them using a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have set up at least one product attribute group. For more information about creating attribute groups, see [Creating Attribute Groups](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/settings/creating-attribute-groups).
* Ensure that you have created at least one leaf category to add the item to. For more information about creating categories, see the [Categories section](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/adding-a-category).

## Procedure

# Adding Item Variants
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/adding-item-variants



Item variants are different versions of a base product that shoppers can choose from. With variants, you can offer an extensive catalog on your storefront, giving shoppers various options for the same item, such as size, color, or material. You can create and manage any number of combinations of options for variations of an item in fabric.

For example, a store sells a dining table in three different materials: oak, pine, or mahogany. Each material comes in options that accommodate 4, 6, or 8 people. Using the variants, you can create 9 different variations for the parent item, the dining table, as shown in the following table:

|             | Oak          | Pine          | Mahogany          |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| **Seats 4** | Oak, seats 4 | Pine, seats 4 | Mahogany, seats 4 |
| **Seats 6** | Oak, seats 6 | Pine, seats 6 | Mahogany, seats 6 |
| **Seats 8** | Oak, seats 8 | Pine, seats 8 | Mahogany, seats 8 |

With the above settings, the storefront displays the parent item with 9 options. Each of these options is a variant of the parent item and is referred to as the child item.

There are two ways to create a variant for an item:

* **Select existing items:** Use this method to add variants to an item by selecting from the items that are already present in your items list. You can use this method only if the desired item specifications or attributes already exist within your catalog.
* **Create variants:** Use this method when you want to introduce an item with new attributes or specifications as a variant of a pre-existing item. In this method, you can simultaneously create a new item and set it as a variant of an existing item.

<Note>When a product is created as a variant, it will initially be classified as an item if the parent product is still in draft.</Note>

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have at least one item in your list to use the **Create variants** method of creating variants.

Ensure that you have at least two items in the same category in your list (one to use as the parent and one to set as the child) to use the **Select existing items** method.

# Importing Items
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/importing-items



Items, a type of product, are objects sold individually as simple SKUs or as the parent to a variant. This document covers the process of importing multiple items using a CSV file. You can also [add items individually](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/adding-an-item).

## CSV File Guidelines

You can import products using CSV files only; no other data or file formats are supported. Here are the key points to consider:

* Formulas in formula-driven attributes are executed automatically after items have been imported.
* If the CSV file doesn't have an attribute that's added to the category, you can add a new column in the CSV with the attribute name in the header. The upload process will populate the value for this attribute.
* Empty rows and columns are ignored.
* Each item should include a category node. If the category node is missing, the item won't be created.
* Use the **->** delimiter for category nodes. Incorrect mapping or absence of category nodes may result in item creation issues.
* The headers, represented in the first row of the CSV file, should match the attributes of the item. While attribute titles aren't case-sensitive, maintaining case consistency with the original attribute titles is recommended.
* The Action field determines what action is being taken for that row of data.
* When updating or upserting items, entering *NULL* in a spreadsheet cell will override existing values with blank values.

We recommend that you download the template file to use as a guide when creating your own CSV file for import to minimize errors during the import process.

The status attribute is imported as live only when all mandatory attributes are provided for the item. Otherwise, the status is automatically updated to draft, regardless of the value you provide in the file.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the item import, ensure that:

* Ensure that you have created at least one leaf category with attributes assigned to it to add items to. For more information about creating categories, see the [Categories section](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/adding-a-category).
* The CSV file adheres to the guidelines.

## Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Product Catalog > List > Items**.\
   The **Items** page is displayed.
2. Click **Import**.\
   The **Select a leaf category** window is displayed.
3. Select a **Leaf** to which you want to import items.\
   The **Select a leaf category** window is displayed. This window displays the root categories and leaf categories that are configured in [Categories](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/overview).
4. Click **Next**.\
   The **Import CSV file** window is displayed. This window provides a link to download an example template for the CSV file.
5. To import a CSV file, do one of the following options:
   * Drag and drop the CSV file into the window.
   * Click **Select a File**.
6. Click **Import file**.

The CSV file is imported and the items are added to your product list.

fabric stores the CSV files you upload to your account. You can view the status of the import and re-download the original files by visiting the [Import History](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/viewing-item-import-history) page.

# Items Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/list/items/items



An item is a standalone service or product sold individually. You can create items manually or import items using a CSV file. Each item can have different variations, known as variants, distinguished by specific differences from the standard version.

For example, in a furniture store, a dining table might have variations in sizes, such as round or rectangular and finishes, such as oak, mahogany, or walnut, resulting in unique versions.

Items and variants must be assigned to one [category or subcategory](v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/overview.mdx) when they're created.

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/overview



fabric Product Catalog in Copilot provides a user-friendly interface for managing product data, attributes, categories, and collections. Designed for merchandising teams, it allows users to configure products, organize inventory, and optimize data quality without relying on API calls.

## Product Catalog AI

[Product Catalog AI](/v3/getting-started/copilot/fabric-ai/product-catalog-ai) provides intelligent recommendations to help retailers optimize and maintain high-quality product data:

* Receive AI-driven suggestions for product descriptions and attributes to improve consistency and SEO.
* Ensure data accuracy by detecting missing or misclassified attributes.
* Optimize merchandising by aligning product information with brand standards and customer expectations.

## Navigation

Product Catalog is accessible through fabric’s cloud-based application called Copilot, and divided into the following menus and sub-menus:

* **List**
  * [Items](/v3/guides/product-catalog/list/items/items): Add, import, and manage product and variant information.
  * [Bundles](/v3/guides/product-catalog/list/bundles/bundles): Add, import, and manage bundle information.
* **Attributes**
  * [Product Attributes](/v3/guides/product-catalog/attributes/product-attributes-overview): Define item, variant, and bundle characteristics.
  * [Category Attributes](/v3/guides/product-catalog/attributes/category-attributes-overview): Define category characteristics.
* **[Categories](/v3/guides/product-catalog/categories/categories_overview):** Create a hierarchy of product groups and relationships.
* **[Collections](/v3/guides/product-catalog/collections/collections):** An alternative method to categories for organizing products.
* **Settings**
  * [Attribute Groups](/v3/guides/product-catalog/settings/attribute-groups-overview): Organize similar attributes together.
  * [Attribute Mapping](/v3/guides/product-catalog/settings/attribute-mapping-overview): Ensure data in Product Catalog is readable and usable to other systems.

## Workflow

The steps below highlight the core features you'll use most often when setting up and managing Product Catalog in Copilot. While these cover the fundamental workflows, Product Catalog includes multiple tools and features to support custom use cases.

1. [Create Attributes](/v3/guides/product-catalog/attributes/product-attributes-overview): Create the required attributes for the products. You can also use attribute groups to group relevant attributes and assign to products or categories.
2. [Map Attributes](/v3/guides/product-catalog/attributes/product-attributes-overview): Map the mandatory attributes of fabric, such SKU, title, image, and active status to the corresponding names provided by the merchant.
3. [Add Categories](/v3/guides/product-catalog/categories/adding-a-category): Arrange items, bundles, and variants into a hierarchical tree structure based on common attributes to logically group products.
4. Create Items, Variants, and Bundles: Add your products, which can consist of [items](/v3/guides/product-catalog/list/items/adding-an-item), [bundles](/v3/guides/product-catalog/list/bundles/adding-a-bundle), and [variants](/v3/guides/product-catalog/list/items/adding-item-variants). Before adding any products, fabric recommends the following:
   * Maintain a list of attributes for products and categories.
   * Organize products within a hierarchical tree structure of categories.
   * Compile a products list, along with their variants and bundles, to display on the storefront.
5. [Create Collections](/v3/guides/product-catalog/collections/creating-a-collection): Organize products according to marketing needs for display on your storefront. Collections are optional.

Once these steps are complete, basic setup is finished. You may proceed to use the features and capabilities available to you.


# Attribute Groups Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/settings/attribute-groups-overview



### Overview

Attribute groups enable merchants to organize various attributes together based on meaning or purpose for an easier, more logical flow during the set up process.

For example, a furniture store might need to have height, width, length, or depth attributes present on the item or bundle listing page on their storefront. The merchant can create an attribute group called *dimensions* so that all dimension-related details can be added in one place when adding a new piece of furniture. This allows merchants to streamline the setup process and reducing the time required to manage extensive attribute data in large catalogs.

Before creating attribute groups, you must first set up the attributes that you want to group together in the Attributes > Products page.

While attribute groups enhance storefront convenience, setting them up is optional and not mandatory for product setup.

# Attribute Mapping Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/settings/attribute-mapping-overview



### Overview

Before creating items in the Product Catalog, proper attribute mapping is essential to ensure other systems can read and use data from the Product Catalog.

fabric has a predefined set of mandatory attributes for items and bundles that Product Catalog uses to deliver a consistent and reliable experience across channels.

However, merchants may have their own naming conventions for these attributes. For instance, Product Catalog uses the term SKU to refer to a unique product identifier while some merchants use the terms UPC or Part Number. To address this inconsistency, merchant-defined attributes are mapped to fabric attributes as productId -> fabric SKU.

Only the SKU is mandatory to create items, but each basic attribute should be mapped to exactly one attribute from the list of attributes.

Attribute mapping is done once, before uploading any items or bundles. After you have mapped the attributes and begun uploading, the features in attribute mapping are disabled.

### Basic attributes detail

Refer to the following table for more information about each attribute.

| Mapping Name          | Attribute Specifications                       | Why does this need to be mapped?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SKU                   | Must be a mandatory Attribute                  | Each SKU value must be unique. This attribute serves as the primary identifier for items to be created in Product Catalog.                                                                                                                                     |
| Product Title         | A text or number type attribute is recommended | This attribute helps Product Catalog identify the display name of the item or bundle.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Primary Product Image | A text type attribute is recommended here      | This attribute helps Product Catalog identify the main image of the product for thumbnail purposes.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Active                | Must be a mandatory attribute                  | Must be a Boolean type attribute. Name the attribute to be Active which can be set to true/false. Required to maintain the status of item to active/disabled. Only items where status is set to Active=TRUE will be available for the commerce API to consume. |

This endpoint completely replaces the existing details.



# Copy Category to Collections
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/copy-category-to-collections

category.openapi post /collections/actions/copy-category
This endpoint is used to replicate category tree hierarchy to collections.



# Create Collection
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/create-collection

category.openapi post /collections
Collection is an alternative way to organize products compared to the Category system, which is the original organization of items. Because the Category system isn't granular enough to meet all the requirements of Storefronts, collections are used to organize products as per the merchant's requirements. This endpoint is used to create a new collection within the alternative organization so that it can be adapted to support various use-cases of Storefronts.



# Delete Collection
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/delete-collection

category.openapi delete /collections/{id}

# Get Products Under Collection
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/get-products-under-collection

category.openapi get /collections/{id}/products
To ensure the right set of products are organized within a collection, it's important to review products in each collection. This endpoint gets a paginated list of products in a collection.  **Note**: You can refine your search by specifying `offset` and `limit`. When they're not specified, you'll get up to 10 products by default.



# Collections
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/overview



As the **Categories** system may not be sufficiently granular to accommodate all Storefront use cases, **Collections** provides an alternative means of organizing products on the storefront. Collections create a representational categorization of products, and are primarily used by merchants for short-term marketing campaigns. For instance, a collection could be created for a New Year sale that highlights discounted furniture products.


# Partially Update Collection
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/partially-update-collection

category.openapi patch /collections/{id}
In contrast to the Update Collection endpoint - `PUT /collections/{id}`, which fully overwrites the collection details, this endpoint allows for selective modification of specific details such as fixing any typos present in the collection name as well as facilitating addition or removal of attributes



# Syncing Collections Using Delta Files
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/syncing-collections-using-delta-files



Collections help organize products for commerce channels and shoppers by using category source inclusions/exclusions and attribute-based rules.

Product Catalog maintains collection assignments through two background jobs, which evaluate and update product assignment based on attribute or rule changes:

| Job Name                                  | Function                                                                                          | Event                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product Update: Collection Evaluation** | Monitors product attribute updates and re-evaluates product eligibility for collections.          | `pim:jobs.ProductUpdate.CollectionEvaluation:completed`<br />`pim:jobs.ProductUpdate.CollectionEvaluation:failed` |
| **Collection Update: Product Evaluation** | Monitors collection rule updates and re-evaluates products based on the revised collection rules. | `pim:jobs.CollectionUpdate.ProductEvaluation:completed`<br />`pim:jobs.CollectionUpdate.ProductEvaluation:failed` |

If you are subscribed to Product Catalog's Collections [webhook events](/v3/platform/settings/webhooks/list-of-products-events), the system synchronizes product updates using delta files. The following diagram shows the sequence of tasks performed during the synchronization process:

![Integration Sequence Diagram](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fabric-demo/images/integrationsequencediagram.png)

The system runs background jobs that generate product update files. Depending on the job status, an event is triggered.

<note>Ensure that the webhook listener is subscribed to both "completed" and "failed" events, as failed jobs might still update some products.</note>

## Synchronization Process

### 1. Job execution

The system runs one of two background jobs:

* Product Update: Collection Evaluation (re-evaluates product fitment based on attribute updates).
* Collection Update: Product Evaluation (re-evaluates products based on collection rule changes).

### 2. Event triggering

Once a job completes successfully or fails, it triggers an event. The webhook listener must be subscribed to both **completed** and **failed** events because failed jobs may still update some products.

### 3. Event delivered

The fabric event publisher delivers the event to the webhook listener.

### 4. Extract the output file ID

The Webhook Listener retrieves the first output file ID from the event payload. If multiple output files exist:

* Only the first file should be processed.
* Additional files should be reviewed to determine if they contain duplicates, sequential data, or logs.

#### Example payload with output files

```
 {
    "specversion": "v3",
    "type": "pim:jobs.productUpdate.collectionEvaluation:completed",
    "tenantid": "64cbda7e0cf2dcad87b14456",

                    "outputFiles": [
                        "65c372f1b683f0539a8c18b1"
                    ],
                    "errorFiles": [],
                    "status": "COMPLETED",
                    "createdAt": "2024-02-07T11:58:15.814Z",

               }
            ]
        }
    ]
 }
```

### 5. Retrieve the file download link

Make an API request to fetch the file download link using the extracted file ID.

#### Example cURL request

```
 curl--location
 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-files/actions/download?fileId=65c372f1b683f0
 539a8c18b1' \--header 'Authorization: <token>' \--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: 64cbda7e0cf2dcad87b14456'
```

### 6. Download and extract the file

Download the output file from the retrieved link. The downloaded file is a .zip archive that must be extracted before use.

Retry logic:

* If the download fails, retry with exponential backoff.
* Verify file integrity before extraction.

#### Example signed URL for file download

```
{
  "location": "https://pim-v3-prod01-us-east-1-files.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/product-batch-job/64cbda7e0cf2dcad87b14ad7/prod01/1707307761501-65c3705726f919316ba95361-product-job-outputFile.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20240207T193937Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=3f33806438e10764832d0a3dd5f2e98d02be31476b5bb94f7805b775744b60d0"
}
```

This signed URL is a temporary, pre-authenticated link that allows you to download the generated output file. The URL includes security parameters such as an expiration time `X-Amz-Expires`, an algorithm used for signing `X-Amz-Algorithm`, and a signature `X-Amz-Signature`.

Ensure that the webhook listener processes the file right after retrieval to avoid needing multiple API requests.

If the URL expires before the file is downloaded, request a new signed URL by calling the File API again.

### 7. Process the extracted data

If no products were updated, the file contains the message "No products updated."

If products were updated, the file contains JSON entries listing:

* Product ID
* SKU
* Type (item, variant, or bundle)
* Status (live, draft)
* Collections the product was added to or removed from

#### Example JSON entries

```
{
  "id": "65b293d4bc83fd68411eb0e7",
  "sku": "GZZ19228-150-35_pim_pim_2",
  "type": "ITEM",
  "status": "LIVE",
  "collections": {
    "added": ["65c3e29b8cf6b31a1f1845fb"],
    "removed": []
  }
}
```

### 8. Synchronize the updated data

Process the extracted product data for further synchronization within the system to ensure that any updates correctly propagate through downstream services.

This endpoint replaces the existing details. <br /> 2. To avoid impacting the entire data, for minor updates, use the Partially update collection endpoint instead - `PATCH /collections/{id}`.



# Configuring Product Catalog
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/developer-guide/configuring-product-catalog



Setting up Product Catalog involves defining product attributes, structuring categories, and managing products, variants, and bundles. This ensures a scalable and well-organized catalog that aligns with your business needs.

This topic covers the key steps to configure Product Catalog.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

* Administrator or editor privileges to fabric Product Catalog. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/guides/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control).
* A valid [Authorization Token](/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/authentication-endpoints/fetch-access-token) to provide in the header.

## Workflow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the required steps to set up Product Catalog.

![Getting Started Diagram](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fabric-demo/images/gettingstartedworkflow.jpg)

### Procedure

Use this procedure to configure Product Catalog. The API collections for the endpoints are:

1. Before using Product Catalog APIs, users must authenticate API requests with a valid authorization token. Authentication is performed through API apps, which generate API keys to validate requests. Use [system apps](/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/system-apps/getting-started-with-system-apps) for backend integrations and [user apps](/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/user-apps/getting-started-with-user-apps) for authentication tied to individual or user credentials.

2. Create attributes using one of the following methods:
   * **Individually**: Create a new attribute using the [create attribute](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attributes/create-attribute) endpoint. By specifying the `target` in the request body as a `product` or `category`, you can assign the attribute to a product or a category, respectively.
   * **Bulk Import**: Import multiple attributes at once through bulk import APIs. For more information, see the [bulk import guide](https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/developer-guide/configuring-product-catalog#bulk-importing-product-data).
   * (Optional) Create attribute groups using the [create attribute groups](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attribute-groups/create-product-attribute-group) endpoint to group related attributes for easier management and assignment.

3. Map the mandatory fabric attributes, such as `sku`, `title`, `image`, and `active`, to the corresponding attribute names provided by the merchant. Use the [update attribute mapping](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/attributes-mapping/update-attributes-mapping) endpoint to create or update these mappings.

4. Create categories to organize products into a structured hierarchy using one of the following methods:
   * **Individually**: Use the [create category](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/categories/create-category) endpoint to add a single category. A default root category is created automatically and can't be modified.
   * **Batch create**: Use the [create multiple categories](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/bulk-action-for-categories-and-collections/create-multiple-categories) endpoint to add up to 25 categories in one request.
   * **Bulk Import**: For larger imports, use the bulk import APIs as directed in the [bulk import guide](https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/developer-guide/configuring-product-catalog#bulk-importing-product-data). Use the `categoryIdsIncluded` and `categoryIdsExcluded` fields to control which categories are included or excluded in a catalog.

5. Assign attributes to categories using the [create category](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/categories/create-category) or [partially update category](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/categories/partially-update-category) endpoints. When attributes are assigned to a category, they automatically apply to all products within that category.

6. Add items to your catalog using one of the following methods:
   * **Individually**: Use the [add product](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/product-operations-by-id/add-product) endpoint and specify the `type` as item.
   * **Batch create**: Add up to 25 items at once using the [add products](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/product-operations-by-id/add-product) endpoint.
   * **Bulk Import**: Import a large number of items with bulk import APIs. For details, see the [bulk import guide](https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/developer-guide/configuring-product-catalog#bulk-importing-product-data).

7. Add variants to existing items using one of the following methods:

   * **Individually**: Use the [add product](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/product-operations-by-id/add-product) endpoint and set the `type` to `variant`.
   * **Multiple variants**: Add up to 25 variants using the same [add Products](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/product-operations-by-id/add-product) endpoint.
   * **Bulk Import**: Use bulk import APIs to import variants in large volumes. For details, see the [bulk import guide](https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/developer-guide/configuring-product-catalog#bulk-importing-product-data).

   <Note> If the parent product is in `DRAFT` status, variants are treated as separate items until the parent is published. Parent and child products must share the same category and channel. </Note>

8. Add bundles using one of the following methods:
   * **Individually**: Use the [add Product](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/product-operations-by-id/add-product) endpoint with the `type` set to `bundle`.
   * **Multiple bundles**: Add up to 25 bundles using the [add Products](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/product-operations-by-id/add-product) endpoint.
   * **Bulk Import**: Use bulk import APIs to add bundles at scale. For details, see the [bulk import guide](https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/developer-guide/configuring-product-catalog#bulk-importing-product-data).

9. (Optional) Use the [create collections](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/collections/create-collection) endpoint to organize products for specific storefront displays. Collections allow you to group products across categories based on shared attributes or promotional needs—ideal for seasonal campaigns, featured product sets, or curated shopping experiences.

10. Assign attributes to collections. After creating a collection, assign relevant attributes that will be used to filter the products displayed within it. This ensures that collection rules, such as “color" is "red” or “price" is under "\$100,” can be evaluated correctly. Use the [get attributes groups of a category](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/categories/get-attribute-groups-of-a-category#get-attribute-groups-of-a-category) endpoint to view attribute groups and confirm the correct attributes are available for use in filtering logic.

## Bulk Importing Product Data

The Product Catalog API supports bulk import for attributes, categories, collections, items, variants, and bundles. This allows developers to efficiently manage large datasets and speed up catalog setup. The process involves downloading a CSV template, populating it with product data, uploading it to fabric’s storage system, and triggering a background job to process the file.

For best practices and formatting guidance, see the \[data ingestion]
(/v3/product-catalog/data-ingestion) guide.

When bulk importing attributes, be sure to specify the correct attribute type and subtype in the import template. For the full list of supported types and how they’re used, see [Product Attributes](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/product-attributes-overview).

The following diagram illustrates the import process.

![Bulk Import Workflow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fabric-demo/images/bulkimport.jpg)

### Procedure

1. Download the [template](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/files/generate-the-import-template) for the data type you want to import, whether `item`, `variant`, `bundle`, `attribute`, `category`, or `collection`. This template contains header columns required for successful data ingestion. Fill out the template locally with your product data.

Example: Generate an import template for items:

Bash

```
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-templates/actions/generate \
     --header 'accept: text/csv' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "type": "ITEM",
  "categoryId": "648014741adc8a9de14e1a68",
  "locale": "en-US"
}
'
```

The following code sample provides an example to bulk import attributes:

Bash

```
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-templates/actions/generate \
     --header 'accept: text/csv' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{"type":"ATTRIBUTE"}'
```

2. Use the [create file object and get upload location](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/files/create-file-object-and-get-file-upload-location) endpoint to generate an AWS S3 bucket URL for uploading your completed import file. This URL ensures secure, direct file upload to fabric’s storage.

Bash

```
curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-files \
    --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '
{
 "type": "ITEM_VARIANT_EXPORT",
 "name": "bulk_import_123345677788999.csv",
 "locale": "en-US"
}
'
```

3. Use the pre-signed upload URL returned in step 2 to make a `put` request and upload your completed CSV file from your local system.

4. Retrieve previously uploaded or exported files—including error logs—using the [get files available for a merchant](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/files/get-files-available-for-a-merchant) endpoint.

Bash

```
curl --request GET \
    --url 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-files?offset=0&limit=10' \
    --header 'accept: application/json'
```

5. Use the [get jobs](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/jobs/get-jobs-related-to-products) endpoint to monitor the status of previous import or export operations, including completion or failure messages.

Bash

```
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-jobs?offset=0&limit=10' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

This page walks through an example setup for a merchant selling furniture—specifically, how a store might structure its Product Catalog to support a category for lamps. The example includes creating attributes, categories, subcategories, and products such as ceiling and table lamps. The table below shows the structure being created.

| Category | Sub-Categories | Products                    |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Lamps    |                |                             |
|          | Ceiling Lamps  |                             |
|          |                | Atlas Pendant Ceiling Lamp  |
|          |                | Apollo Pendant Ceiling Lamp |
|          | Table Lamps    |                             |
|          |                | Hudson Table Lamp           |
|          |                | Luminary Table Lamp         |

Both items and categories have attributes. Each product can have multiple attributes associated with it. Because you need to add attributes to both categories and products, the first step in building the lamps category is to create the necessary attributes. In this example, lamps need to have a `style` attribute for all the products.

1. Create the `style` attribute with the values `modern`, `traditional`, and `rustic` using the `product-attributes` endpoint. This attribute distinguishes lamps by aesthetic, and is defined with the `OPTIONS` type to support multiple accepted values. If `isMandatory` is set to `true`, any product associated with the attribute must include one of the accepted values. The request returns a unique attribute ID, which you'll need when mapping attributes later in the process.

Bash

```
curl --location 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-attributes' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: ' \
--header 'Authorization;' \
--data '
{
  "name": "Style",
  "type": "OPTIONS",
  "target": "PRODUCT",
  "isLocalizable":false,
  "localizedProperties":{},
  "validation": {
    "isMandatory": false,
    "acceptedValues": ["Modern", "Traditional", "Rustic"],
    "subType": "SINGLE",
    "isManualOverwrite": false,
    "isDecimal": false,
    "formula": ""
  }
}
'
```

2. Create the `lamps` category using the `categories` endpoint. This serves as the top-level group for all lamp-related products. After a successful request, the response will return a category ID—keep this ID on hand, as you’ll use it when creating sub-categories in the next step.

Bash

```curl --location 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/categories' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: ' \
--header 'Authorization: ' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "name":"Lamps"
}
'
```

3. Create the `ceiling lamps` and `table lamps` subcategories using the bulk insert API. In the request body, provide the `parentCategoryId` from the `lamps` category created in Step 2. You can optionally enable localization support using the `isLocalizable` field and define localized names under `localizedProperties`.

Bash

```
curl --location 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/categories/batch' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: ' \
--header 'Authorization: ' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "categories": [
        {
            "parentCategoryId": "65a503418b49c6d313211159",
            "name": "Ceiling Lamps",
            "isLocalizable": true,
            "localizedProperties": {
              "en-US": {
                "name": "Ceiling Lamps"
              },
              "es-US": {
                "name": "Lámparas de techo"
              }
            },  
         },
         {
            "parentCategoryId": "65a503418b49c6d313211159",
            "name": "Table Lamps",
            "isLocalizable": true,
            "localizedProperties": {
              "en-US": {
                "name": "Table Lamps"
              },
              "es-US": {
                "name": "Lámparas de mesa"
              }
            }, 
         }
        }
    ],
}'
```

4. Map the `style` attribute to the `lamps` category using the `categories` endpoint. Set `isMandatory` to `true` to ensure that all products in this category and its subcategories `ceiling lamps` and `table lamps` must include a `style` value. This attribute mapping ensures consistency across the product hierarchy and streamlines catalog validation. Use the attribute ID returned when the `style` attribute was created.

Bash

```shell
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/categories/557f1f77bcf86cd799439015' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: ' \
--header 'Authorization: ' \
--data '
{ "name": "Lamps",
  "productAttributes": [
    {
      "isMandatory": true,
      "id": "557f1f77bcf86cd799439015"
    }
  ]
}
'
```

5. Create four `live` status products, each assigned to either the `ceiling lamps` or `table lamps` subcategory. To enable variants, include the `parentProduct` field for each variant entry. Use the bulk insert API to add the base products along with their attributes, such as `style`, `name`, `SKU`, and image URL. Variants will inherit the category and must meet any mandatory attribute requirements defined earlier.

Bash

```shell
curl --location 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/batch' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: ' \
--header 'Authorization: ' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "products": [
        {
            "sku": "AGLAMPTL12",

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}'
```

6. Create a `sale` category for `Modern Style Furniture` and `Cyber Monday`

* Create the parent collection, `sale`.

Bash

```
curl --location 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/collections' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: ' \
--header 'Authorization: ' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "isRoot": true,
    "isLocalizable": false,
    "name": "Sale",
    
}'
```

* Create the sub category `Current Sales`. The `parentCollectionID` is returned from the previous response when creating the parent collection `sale`.

Bash

```
curl --location 'https://api.fabric.inc/v3/collections/batch' \
--header 'Authorization: ' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: ' \

      "isLocalizable": false,
      "isRoot": false,
      "isLeaf": false
    }
  ]
}'
```

* Create the `Modern Style Furniture` and `Cyber Monday` categories.

Bash

Product Catalog API, a subset of fabric **Product Catalog**, is designed to improve product management. A product can refer to an item, variant, or bundle.

Product Catalog API enables you to create items, add variants to an item, create a bundle, add items to a bundle, update product attributes, get details of one or more products, delete products and search for products. Each product has a title, ID, category, and assigned attributes. Multiple options of a given item become variants of that item and they're nested under a parent item, allowing the different options to appear for the item.

fabric's **Files and Jobs** API supports bulk import and export of items, attributes, and bundles.

Generally, the first step is to download the appropriate template for import. There are separate endpoints to get templates for items (`POST /item-import-templates`), attributes (`POST /attribute-import-templates`), and bundles (`POST /bundle-import-templates`).

Once the import details are filled out in the template, you need to provide the file name and type in the request body of the `POST /files/product` endpoint. In the endpoint response, you will get the URL to upload the file to be imported. Using job exports endpoints, you can export the uploaded products and attributes based on specified criteria.

For information on the optimal methods to import data into fabric, see [Data Ingestion Best Practices](/v3/api-reference/product-catalog/data-ingestion-best-practices).

# Importing Items
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/catalog-connector/importing-items



Items, which are also referred to as products, are services or stand-alone objects sold individually. This document covers the process of importing items, which is done using a CSV or JSON file.

## File Guidelines

You can import products using a .csv or .json file only. No other data or file formats are supported.

* SKU is a required field to create or update an item.

* You can detach child or variant items from the parent item when importing by entering detach in the Parent SKU field. When the parent/child relationship is removed, the child or variant item becomes a standalone SKU.

* When updating or upserting items, entering null in a spreadsheet cell will override existing values with blank values.

Although not required, fabric recommends that you download the template file to use as a guide when creating your own file for import to minimize errors during the import process.

### Attribute data format

When preparing your file for import, ensure that the attribute data format aligns with following attribute type requirements:

* String: Ensure the data is in text string format. If a string attribute contains multiple values, the values need to be sent as a stringified array, for example: `"a", "b"`.

* Number: Numerical data only.

* Boolean: Use true or false only; other values will be ignored.

## Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Catalog Connector > List > Items**.
   The **Items** page is displayed.

2. Click **Import items**.
   The **Import CSV file** window is displayed. This window provides a link to download example templates for .csv and .json files.

3. To import a file, do one of the following options:
   * Drag the file into the window.
   * Click **Select a File** from your computer.

4. Click **Import file**.

The file is imported and the items are added to your product list.

fabric stores the files that you upload to your account. You can view the status of the import operation and re-download the original files by visiting the **Import History** page.

## Troubleshooting

For a list of common errors when importing and how to correct them, refer to the following table:

| **Error Message**     | **Description** | **Impact**                         | **Comment** | **Comment**                    |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Internal Server Error | Server issues   | The item isn't created or updated. | Try again   | This is an intermittent issue. |

# Items Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/catalog-connector/items-overview



An item is a standalone service or product sold individually. You can create items by importing them using a .csv or .json file. Each item can have different variations, known as variants, distinguished by specific differences from the standard version. fabric Catalog Connector doesn't validate or display the relationship between a parent and its variants. It simply stores each product as a distinct item.

# Catalog Connector Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/catalog-connector/overview



Catalog Connector is a denormalized data organization tool that enables merchants to link information from their third-party product information management system to their fabric account, making it accessible across fabric modules such as Offers, Orders, and Inventory.
This data can include technical specifications, such as size and weight, design attributes, such as color and material, and generic product details such as name, description, and ID.

Catalog Connector provides out-of-the-box integrations with fabric services, such as Orders and Offers, that enable merchants to apply base prices and promotions to any products available within the Catalog Connector.

Key Catalog Connector capabilities include:

* **Bulk Management:** Import product information in a CSV or JSONL file.

* **Catalog Management:** Manage product create, update, and delete actions, including parent, variant, and bundle products.

Catalog Connector is only available to fabric users who haven't purchased fabric’s proprietary product information manager, Product Catalog.

Catalog Connector setup involves importing products and bundles and their properties in a CSV or JSONL file.

# Exporting Offers CSV
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/developer-guide/exporting-csv



This topic provides developers with step-by-step instructions for exporting product pricing data in CSV format using Offers export API endpoints. It includes initiating an export request and downloading a CSV file containing product prices, enabling seamless integration with pricing analytics, inventory management, or external reporting tools.

Exporting product pricing data as a CSV file involves three main steps:

1. [Initiate an export request](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/initiate-export-request): Send a request to generate an `exportId` and configure filters to target specific data.
2. [Retrieve the export details](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/get-export-request-by-id): Use the `exportId` to check the progress and retrieve the `fileId` after the export is complete.
3. [Download the CSV File](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/download-exported-csv-file): With the `fileId`, obtain a download link to retrieve the CSV file.

## Export parameters

You can the refine the data included in your export by specifying filters in the `filters` array. If you leave the array empty, all data is included. The following table describes the parameters for filtering and the functions of each parameter:

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `field`       | Specifies the data type used to search. Use `priceType` to set it as the search criteria.                                                                                                       |
| `value`       | Specifies the exact value for the selected `field`. If `priceType` is used as `field`, you must enter the corresponding `priceType` value for this parameter.                                   |
| `operator`    | Specifies how the `value` is applied to the `field`. If the field is `priceType` and the operator is set to `EQUAL`, all products with the specified `value` are included in the search result. |

The following table provides detailed information for the two different data types:

* `CALCULATED_PRICE`: If the data type you want to export is `CALCULATED_PRICE`, use the following `field`, `operator`, and `value`:

## Procedure

### Step 1: Initiating an export request

1. Submit a POST request including the `type`, such as `CALCULATED_PRICE` or `REDEMPTION` with any required `filters`.
   The duration for this process increases with the amount of data being exported. The [initiate offers export](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/initiate-export-request) endpoint initiates a CSV export request and generates an `exportId`. The following example shows a POST request with the request body set to `type` as `REDEMPTION`, searching for `storeId` with the value `store001`:

   <Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the request payload.">
     ```bash
     curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.fabric.inc/v3/offers-exports \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer exampleToken123' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: exampleTenantID456' \
     --data '{
     "type": "REDEMPTION",
     "filters": [
             {
             "field": "storeId",
             "value": "store001",
             "operator": "EQUAL"
             }
         ]
     }'
     ```
   </Accordion>

   A successful request returns the following response:

   <Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the response.">
     ```json
     {
     "exportId": "ab50fe48-5da0-4e77-92d1-bb629eedf19e",
     "startedAt": "2023-05-17T21:24:52.398Z",
     "endedAt": "null",
     "totalDataExported": 0,
     "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
     "errors": [],
     "type": "REDEMPTION",
     "filters": [
         {
         "field": "storeId",
         "value": "store001",
         "operator": "EQUAL"
         }
     ]
     }
     ```
   </Accordion>

### Step 2: Retrieve the `fileId`

After initiating the export request, use the `exportId` generated in [step 1](#step-1-initiate-export-request) to [retrieve details of the request](/v3/api-reference/offers/exports/get-export-request-by-id). You can view the export details, such as `startedAt` and `endedAt` times, as well as the `totalDataExported`. The export request might take up to 10 hours.

1.[Submit a GET request using the `exportId`](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/get-export-request-by-id) endpoint to check the export status to retrieve the `fileId`.

1. When the `status` is `COMPLETED`, use the `fileId` in the [download the exported CSV file](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/download-exported-csv-file) step to download the CSV file.

Use the following GET request to retrieve the details of an export request, including its status and `fileId`:

<Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the request payload.">
  ```bash
  curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.fabric.inc/v3/offers-exports/ab50fe48-5da0-4e77-92d1-bb629eedf19e \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer exampleToken123' \
  --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: exampleTenantID456'
  ```
</Accordion>

A successful request returns the following response:

<Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the response.">
  ```json
  {
  "exportId": "ab50fe48-5da0-4e77-92d1-bb629eedf19e",
  "startedAt": "2023-05-17T21:24:52.398Z",
  "endedAt": "null",
  "totalDataExported": 0,
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
  "errors": [],
  "type": "REDEMPTION",
  "filters": [
      {
      "field": "storeId",
      "value": "store001",
      "operator": "EQUAL"
      }
  ],
  "fileId": "redemption/tenantId/1687472977242-redemption-export.csv"
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Note>Wait until you receive a response with `status: COMPLETED` before moving to the next step. If you don't receive a `status` of `COMPLETED`, [you won't get a complete export file](#exported-file-is-incomplete).</Note>

### Step 3: Downloading the exported CSV file

1. After retrieving `fileId` from [step 2](#step-2-retrieve-the-fileid), include it in the request body of the [download exported CSV file](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/download-exported-csv-file) endpoint to generate a temporary URL for downloading the file as shown in the following request:

   <Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the request payload.">
     ```bash
     curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.fabric.inc/v3/offers-exports/actions/download-export-file \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer exampleToken123' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: exampleTenantID456' \
     --data '{
     "fileId": "redemption/tenantId/1687472972-redemption-export.csv"
     }'
     ```
   </Accordion>

   A successful request returns the following response with a URL used to download your file:

   <Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the response.">
     ```json
     {
     "url": {Your Download URL},
     "fileId": "redemption/tenantId/1687472972-redemption-export.csv"
     }
     ```
   </Accordion>

   You can copy and paste the URL from the response into your browser's address bar to download your file.

<Note>This URL is valid for 5 minutes. If you exceeded this duration, repeat [step 3](#step-3-download-exported-csv-file) to generate another URL.</Note>

## Common Variations

### Searching with multiple fields

You can include more than one `field` in the `filters` array as long as you are filtering single data type. Using more than one `field` allows you to refine the search results to meet all of the specified search conditions.

You can expand the following example of a POST request to initiate an export request with more than one `field`. In the following example, the request filters `CALCULATED_PRICE` by both `priceType` and `priceListIds`:

<Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the request payload.">
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.fabric.inc/v3/offers-exports \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer exampleToken123' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: exampleTenantID456' \
    --data '{
    "type": "CALCULATED_PRICE",
    "filters": [
      {
        "field": "priceType",
        "value": "BASE",
        "operator": "EQUAL"
      },
      {
        "field": "priceListIds",
        "value": [
          1000003,
          1000004
        ],
        "operator": "IN"
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```
</Accordion>

A successful request returns the following response:

<Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the response.">
  ```json
  {
    "exportId": "4a73a9a9-b8c3-4dc1-a467-c528a1b2dfe7",
    "startedAt": "2023-12-01T10:33:33.638Z",
    "endedAt": "null",
    "totalDataExported": 0,
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "errors": [],
    "type": "CALCULATED_PRICE",
    "filters": [
      {
        "field": "priceType",
        "value": "BASE",
        "operator": "EQUAL"
      },
      {
        "field": "priceListIds",
        "value": [
          1000003,
          1000004
        ],
        "operator": "IN"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

### Retrieving all export requests

If you have initiated multiple export requests, you can retrieve details of all export requests using the [Get all export requests](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/get-all-export-requests) endpoint. A successful request returns an array containing details of all export request details, including the respective `fieldId` values. You can expand the following example to see the GET response:

<Accordion title="Click here to expand and see the response.">
  ```json
  {
    "query": {
      "size": 10,
      "offset": 10,
      "count": 50
    },
    "data": [
      {
        "exportId": "ab50fe48-5da0-4e77-92d1-bb629eedf19e",
        "startedAt": "2023-05-17T21:24:52.398Z",
        "endedAt": "null",
        "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
        "type": "REDEMPTION",
        "totalDataExported": 0,
        "fileId": "redemption/tenantId/1687294954996-redemption-export.csv"
      },
      {
        "exportId": "4a73a9a9-b8c3-4dc1-a467-c528a1b2dfe7",
        "startedAt": "2023-12-01T10:33:33.638Z",
        "endedAt": "null",
        "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
        "type": "CALCULATED_PRICE",
        "totalDataExported": 0,
        "fileId": "redemption/tenantId/5900139542278-calculated-price-export.csv"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

### `EXPORT_CALCULATED_PRICE_ERROR`

If you get the `EXPORT_CALCULATED_PRICE_ERROR` error after initiating an export request, resubmit the request. If the problem persists, contact [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new).

### Exported file is incomplete

If your exported CSV is incomplete, use the [get export request](/v3/offers/api-reference/offers/exports/get-export-request-by-id) endpoint and ensure that the `status` is marked as `COMPLETED`. If the `status` remains `IN_PROGRESS` after the 10-hours, try the request again or contact [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new).

### CSV file download link not working

The download link is valid for only 5 minutes. If the link has expired, generate the link again using the [download exported CSV file](/v3/api-reference/offers/exports/download-exported-csv-file) endpoint. If the problem persists, contact [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new).

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/coupons/overview



With the Coupons feature in fabric Offers, you can create targeted discounts, incentives, and pricing rules tailored to specific products, categories, collections, product attributes, and customer segments. You can also configure coupon conditions, set exclusions, and define how multiple coupons interact through stacking rules. The key elements of a coupon include:

| **Elements**        | **Description**                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eligible products   | The SKUs, categories, and collections that qualify for the coupon.                                                                      |
| Conditions          | Criteria that define the requirements to activate the coupon, such as a minimum purchase quantity or specific product features.         |
| Discount type       | Formats of the discount, including percentage reductions, fixed amount discounts, or free shipping.                                     |
| Coupon stacking     | Rules determining how coupons combine, whether by allowing multiple discounts or making them exclusive.                                 |
| Dynamic discounting | Controls the way discounts are applied when multiple coupons are eligible, preventing over-discounting by limiting how discounts stack. |
| Coupon messaging    | Customizable coupon messages visible on product pages, in the customer's cart, or at checkout, tailored for specific customer segments. |

To redeem a coupon the customer must enter a coupon code. If the items in their cart meet the criteria you specify, the discount will apply. Unlike [Promotions](/v3/guides/offers/promotions/overview), customers need to provide a code to receive the discount.

## Types of Coupons

fabric supports three types of coupons:

* **SKU Coupon**: A discount targeting specific SKUs, where individual products are selected for eligibility, and a discount type is assigned. This coupon type is ideal for sales on specific products, clearing inventory, or spotlighting new arrivals. For example, a *Spring clearance* could offer a percentage discount on products from the previous year's collection.

* **SKU Quantity Coupon**: A discount applied when a customer buys a specific quantity of a particular SKU. This coupon is often used to clear inventory or promote high-margin products. For example, you can create a *Buy 3, get 15% off* coupon to encourage customers to purchase in bulk and increase average order value.

* **Buy X Get Y Coupon**: A free or discounted product, Y, is offered when customers purchase a designated product or quantity of X. This coupon is ideal for bundling complementary products, driving larger transactions, and increasing cart size. For example, you can create *Buy one, get one free* or  *Buy two, get 50% off the third item* to offer an incentive when the customer's cart meets the minimum purchase threshold.

## Coupon Setup

Setting up a coupon includes configuring key elements such as price lists, coupon codes, product eligibility conditions, discount types, exclusions, and how multiple coupons interact, as described in the following workflow:

1. Create a [coupon code](/v3/guides/offers/coupons/overview#coupon-code) section. When customers enter the coupon code during checkout, the discount will apply if the code is eligible.
2. Choose a [price list](/v3/guides/offers/coupons/overview#price-lists) to establish the baseline pricing, ensuring that discounts apply correctly depending on whether items are full-price or already discounted.
3. Set the [conditions](/v3/guides/offers/coupons/overview#product-eligibility-definitions-for-coupons) that determine which products qualify for the promotion. This could include all products, specific SKUs, categories, or product attributes.
4. Set the [coupon limit](#coupon-limit) that determines how many times a shopper can redeem the coupon. The limit can be set for both the customer and site.
5. Apply [exclusions](/v3/guides/offers/coupons/overview#product-exclusions-from-coupons) to refine the promotion by targeting specific products or excluding certain items from the offer.
6. Specify the type of [discount](/v3/guides/offers/coupons/overview#defining-discounts-and-how-they-re-applied) the customer receives. For example, percentage off, amount off, or free shipping, and decide if it applies to individual items, shipping costs, or the entire cart.
7. Set up [stacking](/v3/guides/offers/coupons/overview#stacking-and-additional-settings) to apply multiple promotions simultaneously. Define how they interact by assigning priorities or making them exclusive.
8. Configure [promotion messaging](/v3/guides/offers/promotions/overview#promotion-messaging) to determine where details appear for customers, such as product pages, the cart, or at checkout. Customize messaging based on customer groups or regions.

### Coupon code

Coupons can be configured as the following:

* **Multiple-use coupons**: Allow you to set a usage limit.
* **Single-use coupons**: Restricted to one-time use per customer.

To create more than single-use coupons, the **Total coupon count** field is used. For example, if you set **Prefix** to `SALE`, **Starting number** to `1`, and **Total coupon count** to `3`, the following coupon codes are generated: `SALE1`, `SALE2`, and `SALE3`. For more information on setting coupon limit, see the [coupon limit](#coupon-limit) section.

### Price lists

Price lists determine how discounts are applied to products. By selecting a price list, you define whether the discount applies to full-price items, sale items, or both. This ensures that coupon pricing is applied as desired, without over-discounting. The following table outlines the different types of price lists and how they determine the application of discounts during a coupon:

| **Price list**         | **Description**                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only base price        | The discount applies only if the item isn't already on sale.                             |
| Only sale price        | The discount applies only if the item is on sale.                                        |
| Both sale & base price | The discount applies regardless of whether the item is at base price or already on sale. |

For more information, see the [pricing guide](/v3/guides/offers/pricing) section.

### Product eligibility definitions for coupons

The **Customer buys** section allows you to define conditions that specify which products are eligible for the coupon. Setting these conditions ensures that the coupon is applied only to products that meet your defined criteria.

The following table describes the options to define product eligibility based on the price list or lists you selected:

| **Condition** | **Description**                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All SKUs      | The coupon applies to all products.                                                         |
| SKUs          | The coupon applies to specific products you select.                                         |
| Categories    | The coupon applies to one or more categories of products that you select.                   |
| Collections   | The coupon applies to one or more collections of products that you select.                  |
| Attributes    | The coupon applies to products based on specific attributes, such as color, size, or brand. |

You can combine multiple conditions using operators to create a more targeted coupon. The `AND` condition requires all conditions to be met, while the **OR** condition allows the coupon to apply if any one condition is satisfied.

For example, if you select both the *Category: Apparel* and *Color: Red*, with the `AND` operator, only red apparel qualifies for the coupon.

On the other hand, if you use the **OR** operator, any items in the category *apparel* will qualify for the coupon.

Combining conditions allows you to ensure that the right products are included based on multiple criteria. For example, you can include all items in the *Apparel* category, but limit the coupon to products with the attribute *Color: Red* or *Size: Large*.

This allows you to ensure that the right products are included based on multiple conditions.

### Coupon limit

Defining the initial group of products—based on SKUs, categories, collections, or product attributes—is the first step in configuring a coupon. Usage limits can be established to manage coupon availability and overuse prevention when creating **Multiple-use** coupons. The following are limits that can be set:

* **Limit use per customer**: Specifies how many times a single customer can redeem the coupon.
* **Limit use per site**: Specifies the total number of redemptions allowed across your retail site.

For example, setting a limit of 1 use per customer and 5 uses site-wide ensures that five unique customers can redeem the coupon before it becomes invalid. If unlimited usage is desired, leave the usage fields empty. Note that single-use coupons don't require these limits, as their usage is inherently restricted.

#### Product exclusions from coupons

After setting your coupon usage limit, you can refine your coupon by excluding specific products. The **Exclude** field allows you to remove certain items from the coupon, even if they meet the initial coupon criteria.

For example, you might run a sale on all products in the *Apparel* category, but exclude premium brands or limited-edition items. Using the exclude field, you can remove these products by specifying their SKUs, categories, collections, or attributes.

You can exclude products in the following ways:

| **Exclusion List** | **Description**                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SKUs               | Specify the SKUs of individual products to exclude from the coupon.  |
| Category           | Specify the categories to exclude from the coupon.                   |
| Collection         | Specify the collections to exclude from the coupon.                  |
| Attributes         | Specify the products by their attributes to exclude from the coupon. |

By using exclusions, you gain greater precision over which products are part of a coupon, avoiding unintended discounts on products that don’t align with your strategy.

### Defining discounts and how they're applied

Different types of discounts can be applied to various aspects of a coupon. Here’s an overview of the most common discount applications:

| **Discount on** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SKU             | The discount applies to the specific SKU or SKUs you specify. Ideal for coupons highlighting specific products or for clearing inventory.                          |
| Shipping        | The discount applies to shipping.                                                                                                                                  |
| Cart            | The discount applies to the total value of the customer's cart. Cart discounts incentivize customers to add more items to their carts to qualify for the discount. |

The discount type defines how the discount is applied to the coupon.

A coupon can support up to three different discounts. For example, you can create a coupon that gives shoppers 10 percent off and then create a second discount that offers free shipping.

There are several discount types available, each with their own function:

| Discount type  | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Percentage off | Reduces the cost of eligible items by a specified percentage. |
| Amount off     | Reduces the cost of eligible items by a specified amount.     |
| Fixed price    | Sets a specific price for eligible items.                     |
| Free           | Only available when the discount applies to shipping.         |

When creating a coupon that applies to the shipping method, you must select a fulfillment rule set that you configured in fabric Orders. For more information, see the [Creating a fulfillment rule set guide](/v3/guides/orders/order-fulfillment-logic/create-a-new-rule-set-ui) section.

#### Shipping discounts

Shipping discounts can be applied with one of the following options:

* Entire cart: Each item in a cart must qualify for the coupon to apply regardless of ship-to locations.
* Entire shipment: Only the items that share the same ship-to locations qualify for the coupon. For example, in the event of multi-fulfillment orders, when part of the order ships to home and part is picked up in-store, shipping discount will only apply to eligible items in the order.

You can use multiple shipping methods, such as home delivery, in-store pickup, or split shipments. However, only a single discount type can be applied per shipping method. This means if one part of the order is shipped and another part is picked up, you can apply different discounts to different shipping methods.

### Dynamic discounting

Dynamic discounting allows coupons to have variable discount amounts, preventing over-discounting when multiple coupons stack. By enabling dynamic discounting, you can set limits on the discount percentage or amount applied, ensuring that the total discount remains controlled even when coupons overlap. For example, if one coupon discounts an item or cart by 40%, you can limit a subsequent discount to 10%.

Dynamic Discounts aren't eligible for buy-get or spend-get coupons.

## Stacking and Additional Settings

Coupon stacking refers to the ability to combine multiple coupons or discounts on the same cart. When coupon stacking is enabled, a customer can apply more than one discount to their cart, increasing the overall savings. For example, a customer could receive both a 10% discount for a store-wide sale and an additional \$5 off for a specific product coupon.

Coupon stacking is controlled by assigning a priority to each coupon. Coupons with a lower priority number are applied first, and subsequent coupons are stacked on top, applying their discounts to the already-discounted price.

This allows for more control over how multiple coupons interact, ensuring that coupons with higher priority are considered before others.

Coupons are stacked using the following options:

* **Stackable**: The coupon can stack with any other discount, except for those set to exclusive. The discounts are applied on top of each other, increasing the total discount amount if the discounts apply to the same item. Stackable coupons require a priority, which defines the order in which stackable coupons are evaluated. Starting with priority 1, coupons are evaluated and applied in ascending order. Priority 1 uses the price on the price list to apply the discounts. Priority 2 coupons are evaluated with their applicable discounts stacked on top of the discounted price from priority 1 coupons. Evaluation continues until all stackable priorities have been evaluated and applied.

* **Exclusive**: The coupon can't be combined with other discounts, except Universal. Only one non-stackable coupon is applied to the cart, even if other items are eligible. This is considered globally exclusive. In these cases, Offers applies the coupons with the largest monetary discount. If two coupons have the same monetary discount amount, the most recently published coupon is applied.

* **Type exclusive**: This coupon can't be combined with other coupons of the same discount type, such as SKU, cart, or shipping. When multiple coupons of the same type are available, only the one with the highest level or best discount is applied to the customer’s order. This ensures that conflicting coupons don't overlap, preventing excessive discounts.

* **Universal**: The coupon is always evaluated and applied. These discounts are applied last and can stack on any other coupon regardless of its stacking setting.

### Coupon messaging

Coupon messaging allows you to create custom messages to customers on the Product Detail Page (PDP), Product List Page (PLP), in the customer's cart, and on the checkout page, or any combination of these.

Additionally, you can target specific customer groups by choosing the locale, ensuring the message is displayed in the appropriate language or region. This feature helps ensure that your coupon offers are clearly communicated to the right audience.

### Coupon attributes

Coupon attributes are internal-facing tags to categorize and classify coupons for use in reporting and analytics.

For example, you can tag coupons with attributes such as *Seasonal Sales* and further define them with values such as *Summer* or *Fall*. This classification allows you to query and report on coupons based on the attributes you’ve assigned, making it easier to measure the performance of targeted campaigns.

For more information on creating these attributes, see the [Attributes guide](/v3/guides/offers/settings#attributes) section.

### Customer segments

You can define which customer segments are eligible for the coupon. Targeting customer segments allows you to apply discounts or special offers to specific groups of customers.

For more information on customer segments, see the [customer segments](/v3/guides/offers/settings#customer-segments) section.

# Adding Bulk Price
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/pricing/add-bulk-price



The **Add Bulk Price** feature allows you to upload a [CSV file](/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/pricing/price_template.csv) with details such as cost, price, and clearance price. This streamlined process eliminates the need for manual data entry, reduces errors, and saves time.

## CSV File Guidelines

fabric doesn't support any other data or file formats. Here are the key points to consider:

* The headers, represented in the first row of the CSV file, should match the product details.
* Empty rows and columns are ignored. Ensure that fields don't contain blank spaces, returns, line breaks, or other characters not supported in the CSV.
* fabric provides a CSV template file. Not following the parameters in the template can result in errors when uploading.

## Product Price Data Formatting

When preparing a CSV file for import, ensure that the product pricing data format aligns with the following column requirements:

| **Header**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                |

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/pricing/pricing-overview



Pricing is a core feature of the fabric platform, enabling merchants to manage product prices across their catalog. It works seamlessly with Product Catalog to ensure that the products you upload into your fabric account are automatically available for pricing.

## Key Benefits

* Seamless Integration: Pricing works directly with the Product Catalog, automatically displaying all uploaded products for efficient price management.
* Centralized Management: Access and configure all product prices from the **Offers> Pricing** page.

## Use Case

A merchant needs to set up and manage product prices for its online store. To achieve this, the merchant uploads products to the **Product Catalog** in fabric, making them available for pricing configuration through the **Offers > Pricing** page. This integration centralizes pricing tasks, enabling the merchant to define and control prices efficiently.

Through the **Offers > Pricing** page, the merchant sets base prices for each product. These base prices ensure consistent and accurate pricing for buyers across the platform. By managing prices for individual products or entire catalogs in one place, the merchant maintains full control over their pricing structure and strategies.

The merchant can also adjust prices for products as needed. Whether modifying the price of a single product or applying changes across an entire catalog, the merchant uses the **Offers > Pricing** page to make updates seamlessly. These adjustments are automatically reflected across the platform, ensuring alignment and accuracy across all channels.

With features like **clearance pricing** to prevent over-discounting during promotions or coupon campaigns, and real-time update capabilities, pricing empowers merchants to adapt quickly to market changes. This flexibility allows businesses to remain competitive while maintaining control over profitability and customer value.

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/promotions/overview



With the Promotions feature in fabric Offers, you can create targeted discounts, incentives, and pricing rules tailored to specific products, categories, collections, product attributes, and customer segments. You can also configure promotion conditions, set exclusions, and define how multiple promotions interact through stacking rules. The key elements of a promotion include:

| **Elements**        | **Description**                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eligible products   | The SKUs, categories, and collections that qualify for the promotion.                                                                        |
| Conditions          | Criteria that define the requirements to activate the promotion, such as a minimum purchase quantity or specific product features.           |
| Discount type       | Formats of the discount, including percentage reductions, fixed amount discounts, or free shipping.                                          |
| Promotion stacking  | Rules determining how promotions combine, whether by allowing multiple discounts or making them exclusive.                                   |
| Dynamic discounting | Controls the way discounts are applied when multiple promotions are eligible, preventing over-discounting by limiting how discounts stack.   |
| Promotion messaging | Customizable promotional messages visible on product pages, in the customer's cart, or at checkout, tailored for specific customer segments. |

Promotions are applied automatically to a customer's order once the items in their cart meet the criteria you specify. Unlike [Coupons](/3/offers/user-guides/offers/coupons/overview), customers don't need to provide a code to receive the discount.

## Types of Promotions

fabric supports three types of promotions:

* **SKU Promotion**: A discount targeting specific SKUs, where individual products are selected for eligibility, and a discount type is assigned. This promotion type is ideal for sales on specific products, clearing inventory, or spotlighting new arrivals. For example, a *Spring clearance* could offer a percentage discount on products from the previous year's collection.

* **SKU Quantity Promotion**: A discount applied when a customer buys a specific quantity of a particular SKU. This promotion is often used to clear inventory or promote high-margin products. For example, you can create a *Buy 3, get 15% off* promotion to encourage customers to purchase in bulk and increase average order value.

* **Buy X Get Y Promotion**: A free or discounted product,Y,  is offered when customers purchase a designated product or quantity of X. This promotion is ideal for bundling complementary products, driving larger transactions, and increasing cart size. For example, you can create *Buy one, get one free* or  *Buy two, get 50% off the third item* to offer an incentive when the customer's cart meets the minimum purchase threshold.

## Promotion Setup

Setting up a promotion includes configuring key elements such as price lists, product eligibility conditions, discount types, exclusions, and how multiple promotions interact, as described in the following workflow:

1. Choose a [price list](#price-lists) to establish the baseline pricing, ensuring that discounts apply correctly depending on whether items are full-price or already discounted.
2. Set the [conditions](#product-eligibility-definitions-for-promotions) that determine which products qualify for the promotion. This could include all products, specific SKUs, categories, or product attributes.
3. Apply [exclusions](#product-exclusions-from-promotions) to refine the promotion by targeting specific products or excluding certain items from the offer.
4. Specify the type of [discount](#defining-discounts-and-how-they-re-applied) the customer receives. For example, percentage off, amount off, or free shipping, and decide if it applies to individual items, shipping costs, or the entire cart.
5. Set up [stacking](#stacking-and-additional-settings) to apply multiple promotions simultaneously. Define how they interact by assigning priorities or making them exclusive.
6. Configure [promotion messaging](#promotion-messaging) to determine where details appear for customers, such as product pages, the cart, or the checkout. Customize messaging based on customer groups or regions.

### Price lists

Price lists determine how discounts are applied to products. By selecting a price list, you define whether the discount applies to full-price items, sale items, or both. This ensures that promotional pricing is applied as desired, without over-discounting. The following table outlines the different types of price lists and how they determine the application of discounts during a promotion:

| **Price list**         | **Description**                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only base price        | The discount applies only if the item isn't already on sale.                             |
| Only sale price        | The discount applies only if the item is on sale.                                        |
| Both sale & base price | The discount applies regardless of whether the item is at base price or already on sale. |

For more information, see [the pricing guide](/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/pricing).

### Product eligibility definitions for promotions

The **Customer buys** section allows you to define conditions that specify which products are eligible for the promotion. Setting these conditions ensures that the promotion is applied only to products that meet your defined criteria.

The following table describes the options to define product eligibility based on the price list or lists you selected:

| **Condition**      | **Description**                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All SKUs           | The promotion applies to all products.                                                         |
| Specific SKUs      | The promotion applies to specific products you select.                                         |
| Categories         | The promotion applies to one or more categories of products that you select.                   |
| Collections        | The promotion applies to one or more collections of products that you select.                  |
| Product Attributes | The promotion applies to products based on specific attributes, such as color, size, or brand. |

You can combine multiple conditions using operators to create a more targeted promotion. The **AND** condition requires all conditions to be met, while the **OR** condition allows the promotion to apply if any one condition is satisfied.

For example, if you select both the *Category: Apparel* and *Color: Red*, with the **AND** operator, only red apparel qualifies for the promotion.

On the other hand, if you use the **OR** operator, any items in the category *apparel* will qualify for the promotion.

Combining conditions allows you to ensure that the right products are included based on multiple criteria. For example, you can include all items in the *Apparel* category, but limit the promotion to products with the attribute *Color: Red* or *Size: Large*.

This allows you to ensure that the right products are included based on multiple conditions.

#### Product exclusions from promotions

After selecting your initial group of products based on SKUs, categories, collections, or product attributes, you can refine your promotion by excluding specific products. The **Exclude** field allows you to remove certain items from the promotion, even if they meet the initial promotion criteria.

For example, you might run a sale on all products in the *Apparel* category, but exclude premium brands or limited-edition items. Using the exclude field, you can remove these products by specifying their SKUs, categories, collections, or attributes.

You can exclude products in the following ways:

* SKUs: Specify the SKUs of individual products that you don’t want to include in the promotion.
* Category: Specify the categories that you don't want to include in the promotion.
* Collection: Specify the collections that you don't want to include in the promotion.
* Attributes: Specify the products by their attributes that you don't want to include in the promotion.

By using exclusions, you gain greater precision over which products are part of a promotion, avoiding unintended discounts on products that don’t align with your strategy.

### Defining discounts and how they're applied

Promotions offer various types of rewards, such as a percentage off, a fixed amount off, or free shipping, to customers when the promotion criteria are met. Different types of discounts can be applied to various aspects of a promotion. Here’s an overview of the most common discount applications:

| **Discount on** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SKU             | The discount applies to the specific SKU or SKUs you specify. Ideal for promotions highlighting specific products or for clearing inventory.                       |
| Shipping        | The discount applies to shipping.                                                                                                                                  |
| Cart            | The discount applies to the total value of the customer's cart. Cart discounts incentivize customers to add more items to their carts to qualify for the discount. |

The discount type defines how the discount is applied to the promotion.

A promotion can support up to three different discounts. For example, you can create a promotion that gives shoppers 10 percent off and then create a second discount that offers free shipping.

There are several discount types available, each with their own function:

| Discount type  | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Percentage off | Reduces the cost of eligible items by a specified percentage. |
| Amount off     | Reduces the cost of eligible items by a specified amount.     |
| Fixed price    | Sets a specific price for eligible items.                     |
| Free           | Only available when the discount applies to shipping.         |

When creating a promotion that applies to the shipping method, you must select a fulfillment rule set that you configured in fabric Orders. For more information, see the [Creating a fulfillment rule set guide](/v3/orders-and-inventory/user-guides/orders/order-fulfillment-logic/create-a-new-rule-set-ui).

#### Shipping discounts

Shipping discounts can be applied with one of the following options:

* Entire cart: Each item in a cart must qualify for the promotion to apply regardless of ship-to locations.
* Entire shipment: Only the items that share the same ship-to locations qualify for the promotion. For example, in the event of multi-fulfillment orders, when part of the order ships to home and part is picked up in-store, only items that qualify within the same ship-to qualify for the promotion.

You can use multiple shipping methods, such as home delivery, in-store pickup, or split shipments. However, only a single discount type can be applied per shipping method. This means if one part of the order is shipped and another part is picked up, you can apply a shipping discount to one method at a time.

### Dynamic discounting

Dynamic discounting allows promotions to have variable discount amounts, preventing over-discounting when multiple promotions stack. By enabling dynamic discounting, you can set limits on the discount percentage or amount applied, ensuring that the total discount remains controlled even when promotions overlap. For example, if one promotion discounts an item or cart by 40%, you can limit a subsequent discount to 10%.

Dynamic Discounts aren't eligible for buy/get or spend/get promotions.

## Stacking and Additional Settings

Promotion stacking refers to the ability to combine multiple promotions or discounts on the same cart. When promotion stacking is enabled, a customer can apply more than one discount to their cart, increasing the overall savings. For example, a customer could receive both a 10% discount for a storewide sale and an additional \$5 off for a specific product promotion.

Promotion stacking is controlled by assigning a priority to each promotion. Promotions with a lower priority number are applied first, and subsequent promotions are stacked on top, applying their discounts to the already-discounted price.

This allows for more control over how multiple promotions interact, ensuring that promotions with higher priority are considered before others.

Promotions are stacked using the following options:

* **Stackable**: The promotion can stack with any other discount, except for those set to exclusive. The discounts are applied on top of each other, increasing the total discount amount if the discounts apply to the same item. Stackable promotions require a priority, which defines the order in which stackable promotions are evaluated. Starting with priority 1, promotions are evaluated and applied in ascending order. Priority 1 uses the price on the price list to apply the discounts. Priority 2 promotions are evaluated with their applicable discounts stacked on top of the discounted price from priority 1 promotions. Evaluation continues until all stackable priorities have been evaluated and applied.

* **Exclusive**: The promotion can't be combined with other discounts, except Universal. Only one non-stackable promotion is applied to the cart, even if other items are eligible. This is considered globally exclusive. In these cases, Offers applies the promotions with the largest monetary discount. If two promotions have the same monetary discount amount, the most recently published promotions are applied.

* **Type exclusive**: This promotion can't be combined with other promotions of the same discount type, such as SKU, cart, or shipping. When multiple promotions of the same type are available, only the one with the highest level or best discount is applied to the customer’s order. This ensures that conflicting promotions don't overlap, preventing excessive discounts.

* **Universal**: The promotion is always evaluated and applied. These discounts are applied last and can stack on any other promotion regardless of its stacking setting.

### Promotion messaging

Promotion messaging allows you to create custom messages that notify customers about active promotions. The message can appear on any combination of the following pages:

The message can appear on Product Detail Page (PDP), Product List Page (PLP), customer's cart, and the checkout page, or any combination of these.

Additionally, you can target specific customer groups by choosing the locale, ensuring the message is displayed in the appropriate language or region. This feature helps ensure that your promotional offers are clearly communicated to the right audience.

### Promotion attributes

Promotion attributes are internal-facing tags to categorize and classify promotions for use in reporting and analytics.

For example, you can tag promotions with attributes such as *Seasonal Sales* and further define them with values such as *Summer* or *Fall*. This classification allows you to query and report on promotions based on the attributes you’ve assigned, making it easier to measure the performance of targeted campaigns.

For more information on creating these attributes, see the [Attributes guide](/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/settings#attributes).

### Customer segments

You can define which customer segments are eligible for the promotion. Targeting customer segments allows you to apply discounts or special offers to specific groups of customers.

For more information on customer segments, see [customer segments](/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/settings#customer-segments).

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/settings/global-exclusions/overview



The global exclusions feature in the fabric Offers service allows you to prevent specific SKUs from being discounted by active promotions. This ensures that designated products maintain their set pricing, regardless of ongoing promotional campaigns.

You can create and manage global exclusion lists in the **Offers > Settings** menu. When setting up an exclusion list, you must:

* Assign a title to the list.
* Define start and end dates or times for the exclusion period.
* Choose to protect **SKU price**, **shipping price**, or both.
* Select SKUs to exclude by bulk uploading a CSV file or browsing **Product Catalog**.

You can edit or delete global exclusion lists as needed and manage price protection across promotions easily. With the bulk upload support, merchants can efficiently exclude multiple SKUs at once, streamlining the process of maintaining pricing control.


# Managing Price Lists
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/offers/user-guides/offers/settings/price-lists



## Overview

A price list is a collection of items and their assigned prices, enabling merchants to implement various pricing strategies within the Offers Settings menu. The same item can exist in multiple price lists with different prices, allowing for promotions, coupons, discounts, and clearance pricing.

Each price list includes key properties, such as currency, start and end dates, and pricing rules. When a price list expires, the prices of the associated items also expire. Merchants can create and manage price lists, and designate one as the default to maintain consistency when multiple lists contain conflicting prices.

Additionally, price lists influence promotions by defining how discounts apply to products—whether on full-price items, sale items, or both. This flexibility allows merchants to maintain accurate, dynamic pricing across products and channels.

## Creating a Price List

1. In the left menu, click **Offers > Settings**.\
   The **Price Lists** tab on the **Offers settings** page is displayed.
2. In the **Price List Name**, enter the name for the price list.
3. In the **Currency** field, select the currency for the price list.
4. In the **Start Date** field, enter the date when this price list takes effect.
5. In the **Time** field, enter the time for when this price list takes effect.
6. In the **End date** field, enter the date when this price list expires.
7. In the **Time** field, enter the time for when this price list expires.
8. Click **Add price list**.

The price list is created.

## Editing a Price List

# Bundles Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/catalog-connector/bundles-overview



Bundles are combinations of two or more products sold exclusively together or individually, depending on the configuration. Pure bundles consist of items exclusively sold together, and individual items can't be purchased separately. Shoppers have the flexibility to buy items in mixed bundles together or separately.

For example, in a living room furniture set consisting of a coffee table and an end table, shoppers can choose to purchase each table individually or buy both tables together as part of the living room set bundle.

You can create bundles by importing them using a CSV or JSON file.

# Importing Bundles
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/catalog-connector/importing-bundles



## Overview

Bundles are two or more items sold together. Creating a bundle allows you to group items that are exclusively sold together or group items that can be purchased together and separately.

This document covers the process of importing bundles, which is done using a CSV or JSON file.

## File Guidelines

You can import products using a CSV or JSON file only; no other data or file formats are supported.

* SKU is a required field to create or update a bundle.

* When adding a SKU to a bundle, enter the quantity to add in the same cell as the SKU itself. For example, if a bundle requires two of item 12345, enter *2, 12345* in the SKU cell.

* When updating or upserting bundles, entering *null* in a spreadsheet cell will override existing values with blank values.

Although not required, we recommend that you download the template file to use as a guide when creating your own file for import to minimize errors during the import process.

### Attribute Data Format

When preparing your file for import, ensure that the attribute data format aligns with following attribute type requirements:

* String: Ensure the data is in text string format. If a string attribute contains multiple values, the values need to be sent as a stringified array, for example: `["a","b"]`.

* Number: Numerical data only.

* Boolean: Use *true* or *false* only; other values will be ignored.

## Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Catalog Connector > List > Bundles**.\
   The **Bundles** page is displayed.

2. Click **Import bundles**.\
   The **Import CSV file** window is displayed. This window provides a link to download example templates for JSON and CSV files.

3. To import a file, do one of the following options:
   * Drag and drop the file into the window.
   * Click **Select a File** from your computer.

4. Click **Import file**.

The file is imported and the bundles are added to your product list.

fabric stores the files that you upload to your account. You can view the status of the import operation and re-download the original files by visiting the **Import History** page.

## Troubleshooting

For a list of common errors when importing and how to correct them, refer to the following table:

| **Error Message**     | **Description** | **Impact**                           | **Solution** | **Comment**                    |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Internal Server Error | Server issues   | The bundle isn't created or updated. | Try again    | This is an intermittent issue. |

# Configuring  Adjustment
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/configuring-adjustments



This feature in Carts API provides you the flexibility to apply adjustments at the cart, item, or fulfillment level. Adjustments are deductible elements that modify the total amount and are non-taxable.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed sequentially to configure an adjustment.

1. [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts).
2. [Create a fulfillment](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment/create-fulfillments) to add a fulfillment adjustment.
3. [Create an item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) to add an item adjustment.

## Adjustment Initialization

You can apply adjustments at multiple levels, including the cart, individual items, or fulfillment. The adjustment maintains a consistent structure across all levels.

The following code sample provides the structure of an adjustment object:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
  {
      "id": "6964b984-49fd-4754-b979-a260e944320c",
      "price": {
          "amount": 10
      },
      "reason": "DelayedOrder",
      "attributes": {
          "reasonDescription": "Price Adjustment due to delayed shipping"
      },
      "updatedAt": "2024-06-20T08:09:58.951Z",
      "createdAt": "2024-06-20T08:09:58.951Z"
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

As multiple adjustments can be applied to a single cart, item, or fulfillment, adjustments are displayed as a collection.

The following code sample provides the structure of an adjustment object in a collection:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
  "adjustments": {
        "total": 10,
        "collection": [
            {
                "id": "6964b984-49fd-4754-b979-a260e944320c",
                "price": {
                    "amount": 10
                },
                "reason": "DelayedOrder",
                "attributes": {
                    "reasonDescription": "Price Adjustment due to delayed shipping"
                },
                "updatedAt": "2024-06-20T08:09:58.951Z",
                "createdAt": "2024-06-20T08:09:58.951Z"
            }
        ]
    }
  ```
</Accordion>

## Examples

# Configuring Fees
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/configuring-fees



The fees feature in Carts API allows you to add, update, or remove additional fees beyond the resource price, such as gifting fees, platform fees, and service fees. These fees can be applied at various levels, including the cart, individual items, or fulfillment, providing flexibility in customizing the total cost structure. Optionally, the fees may be taxable.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed sequentially to configure a fee.

1. [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts).
2. [Create a fulfillment](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment/create-fulfillments) to apply the fulfillment fee.
3. [Create an item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) to add the item fee.

## Fee Initialization

You can apply fees at multiple levels, including the cart, individual items, or fulfillment. The fee resource maintains a consistent structure across all levels. Taxes on fees is controlled by the `taxable` attribute in the request payload, which defaults to `true`. This means fees are taxed unless specifically set to `false`.

The following code sample provides the structure of a fee object:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
  {
      "id": "188514cb-f36b-4835-a8b3-df75164325d7",
      "name": "cart v3 fees",
      "price": {
          "amount": 10
      },
      "taxable": true,
      "attributes": {
          "message": "gifting-fee"
      },
      "updatedAt": "2024-06-20T07:55:49.021Z",
      "createdAt": "2024-06-20T07:55:49.021Z"
  } 
  ```
</Accordion>

The resource is displayed as a collection of fees for the associated resource as multiple fees can be applied to a single resource.

The following code sample provides the structure of a fee object in a collection:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
      "fees": {
          "total": 10,
          "collection": [

                  "price": {
                      "amount": 10
                  },
                  "taxable": true,
                  "attributes": {
                      "message": "gifting-fee"

# Configuring Fulfillment
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/configuring-fulfillment



This feature in Carts API allows you to add, update, or remove fulfillment information in the cart and associate it with individual items. The cart supports multiple fulfillment options.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed sequentially to configure a fulfillment.

1. [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts).
2. [Create a destination address](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/addresses/create-addresses) if the fulfillment type is `SHIP_TO`.
3. [Create an origin address](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/addresses/create-addresses) if the fulfillment type is `BOPIS` or `ROPIS`.

## Fulfillment Initialization

After you create a cart with [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts), you will see the fulfillment resource in the cart response.

The following code sample provides the structure of fulfillment object in a cart response:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
  {
      "id": "a7f51053-6fbd-42a6-8fbc-303bfc16c13f",
      "type": "SHIP_TO",
      "refId": "6425279f661bf878448465b4",
      "originAddress": "{{originAddressId}}",
      "destinationAddress": "{{destinationAddressId}}",
      "price": {
          "amount": 10
      },
      "fees": {
          "total": 0,
          "collection": []
      },
      "adjustments": {
          "total": 0,
          "collection": []
      },
      "tax": {
          "total": 0,
          "collection": []
      }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

The fulfillment resource can be associated with an item using the `fulfillmentId` by making POST request to the `{cartId}/fulfillments` endpoint.

The following code sample provides how the request is structured in a request payload:

### POST Response

<Accordion title="Click to expand the curl example.">
  ```curl
  curl --location '{{cartV3_domain}}/carts/{{cartId}}/items' \
  --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: {tenantId}' \

  --header 'Authorization: {authToken}' \
  --data 
  '{
      "sku": "5",
      "refId": "19",
      "quantity": 10,
      "price": 
      {
          "type": "UNIT",
          "amount": 100
      },
      "fulfillment": 
      {
          "id": "a7f51053-6fbd-42a6-8fbc-303bfc16c13f",  // fulfillmentId
          "inventory": 
          {
              "channels": 
                  {"networkCode": "ShipToHome"},
              "type": "preOrder"
          }
      }
  }'
  ```
</Accordion>

The cart has a fulfillment object that stores all the fulfillments added to it.

You can check your fulfillment information by making a GET request to `carts/{cartId}/fulfillments/{fulfillmentId}` endpoint.

The following code sample provides the structure of fulfillment object in the response:

# Configuring Order Drafts
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/configuring-order-drafts



This feature in Carts API enables the cart to be transformed into a schema ready for submission to the **Order Management System (OMS)**, representing the **order draft** stage before the order is officially created.

At this stage, the cart contains all necessary data, including items, fulfillment details, fees, taxes, and payment information. This transformation ensures that the cart aligns with OMS requirements, allowing for final review and confirmation of the order before proceeding to fulfillment.

## Prerequisites

There are two types prerequisites, depending on your cart configurations.

One of the following prerequisites must be completed sequentially to configure an order draft.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites where cart configurations are set to BLOCK">
  ```json
  "configuration": {
      "order": {
          "validate": {
              "paymentsRemaining": "BLOCK",
              "taxRemaining": "BLOCK",
              "invalidItem": "BLOCK",
              "itemOutOfStock": "BLOCK"
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  **Prerequisites**

  1. [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts).
  2. [Add item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) to the cart.
  3. [Add taxes](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/validations/add-tax) to the resources in the cart.
  4. [Add payments to the cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/payments/create-payments), ensuring they match the cart total.
  5. Ensure that the items added to the cart are valid and in stock.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prerequisites where cart configurations are set to NONE">
  ```json
  "configuration": {
      "order": {
          "validate": {
              "paymentsRemaining": "BLOCK",
              "taxRemaining": "BLOCK",
              "invalidItem": "BLOCK",
              "itemOutOfStock": "BLOCK"
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  **Prerequisites**

  1. [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts).
  2. [Add item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) to the cart.
</Accordion>

## Order Drafts Initialization

The order draft captures a snapshot of the cart, which can then be converted into an order. The ability to create an order draft is controlled by [cart configurations](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/configuration-behaviors). Cart offers users the flexibility to prevent order draft creation if:

* Payments haven't been added to the cart.
* Taxes are missing for resources in the cart.
* Items are invalid.
* Items are out of stock.

The following code sample provides the structure of order draft settings that block creation in the response:

  ```json
  "configuration": {
      "order": {
          "validate": {
              "paymentsRemaining": "BLOCK",
              "taxRemaining": "BLOCK",
              "invalidItem": "BLOCK",
              "itemOutOfStock": "BLOCK"
          }
      }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

## Examples

### Creating an order draft to send to an order management system (OMS)

Use the [create an order draft](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/order-drafts/create-order-drafts) endpoint to create an order draft and send it to OMS as in the following example:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the curl and JSON response example.">
  ```curl
      curl --location '{{orchestrator_domain}}/carts/{{cartId}}/order-draft' \
      --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id: {tenantId}' \
      --header 'x-fabric-request-id: {{requestId}}' \
      --header 'x-fabric-channel-id: {{channelId}}' \
      --header 'Authorization: {authToken}' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
      --data '{
          "orderNumber": "W0013"
      }'
  ```

# Configuring Payment
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/configuring-payment



This feature in Carts API allows users to add, update, and delete payment details. The cart maintains the state of each payment—pending, authorized, captured, and failed—as provided by the user, but it doesn't store tokens, which are expected from the System Integrator (SI).

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed sequentially to configure a payment.

1. [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts).
2. [Add an item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) to the cart.

## Payments Initialization

The cart displays authorized amounts and allows updates or removals of payments. Payments can be purged or held when the cart changes such as, price changes. The cart also verifies the authorized payment amount against the cart total.

The following code sample provides an example of the structure of payment information and status in the response:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
  {
      "provider": "fabricmock",
      "processor": "fabricmock",
      "method": "CREDIT_CARD",
      "methodType": "VISA", 
      "state": "PENDING",
      "authorization": {
      "amount": 520.0,
      "expiry": "",
      "verifier": {
          "type": "PAYMENT_TOKEN",
          "key": "{{payment_token}}"
      }
      },
      "billToAddress": "{{addressId}}",
      "cardDetails": null,
      "attributes":{
          "orderSource": "ecommerce",
          "expirationDate": "0224",
          "requestedDate": "2022-01-27T16:15:58-05:00",
          "paymentDate": "2022-01-27T16:15:58-05:00",
          "billToId": "213321"
      }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

As the cart can contain multiple payments, they are shown as a collection. The authorized amount is the sum of all payments with the **AUTHORIZED** state added to the cart as in the following example:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
  "payments": {
      "authorized": 0,
      "collection": [
          {

              "processor": "fabricmock",
              "method": "CREDIT_CARD",
              "methodType": "VISA", 
              "state": "PENDING",
              "authorization": {

                      "type": "PAYMENT_TOKEN",
                      "key": "{{payment_token}}"
                  }
              },
              "billToAddress": "{{addressId}}",
              "cardDetails": null,
              "attributes":{

                  "paymentDate": "2022-01-27T16:15:58-05:00",
                  "billToId": "213321"
              }
          }
      ]
  }

  ```
</Accordion>

## Examples

Use the [create a payment](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/payments/create-payments) endpoint to add a `CAPTURED` payment method to the cart as in the following example:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the curl and JSON response example.">
  ```curl
      curl --location '{{modular_cart_domain}}/carts/ba0e93f5-e47f-4b0d-bac8-6233b67ef65f/payments' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id:  {tenantId}' \
      --header 'Authorization: {authToken}' \
      --data '{
          "provider": "fabricmock",
          "processor": "fabricmock",
          "method": "CREDIT_CARD",

          "state": "CAPTURED",
          "authorization": {
              "amount": 500.0,
              "expiry": "",
              "verifier": {
              "type": "PAYMENT_TOKEN",
              "key": "{{payment_token}}"
              }
          },
          "billToAddress": "46622c9c-604c-4f8c-8bcf-2a393a572839",
          "cardDetails": null,

                  "billToId": "213321"
          }
      }
      '
  ```

  A successful response to `carts/{cartId}/payments` provides a payments object as the following example:

  ```json
  "payments": {
      "authorized": 0,
      "collection": [
          {

# Configuring Search Cart
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/configuring-search-cart



This feature in Carts API allows the user to search the cart by the following parameters:

* Cart Status
* Order Number
* Customer Information
* Promotion Codes
* Created/Updated Date Range
* Channel ID

## Prerequisites

* A cart that needs to be searched is created with the required parameters using the [create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts) endpoint.

## Search Cart Initialization

The search endpoint returns a paginated response, displaying the first 10 search results by default. The `total` field in the response indicates the number of results found for the search query, capped at 10,000 results.
For queries that exceed this `limit`, use an `offset`. Querying many carts through this endpoint isn't recommended, as it's intended for basic use cases to retrieve a limited number of carts rather than for analytics purposes.

The following code sample provides the structure of `limit`, `offset`, and `total` in the response when searching for a cart:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
  {
      "query": {
          "limit": 20,
          "offset": 0,
          "total": 3
      },
      "data": [
          {
          ...
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

## Examples

### Retrieving a cart with an order number

              "id": "testCustomerId",
              "sessionId": "testSessionId"
          },
          "createdAt": {
              "start": "2024-03-27T06:06:53.709Z",
              "end": "2024-06-29T06:06:53.709Z"
          }
      }
  }'
  ```

# Configuring Split Line Items
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/configuring-split-line-items



Splitting line items allows the user to split a single line item into multiple line items based on quantity.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed sequentially to configure splitting line items.

1. [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts).
2. [Add an item to the cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) that needs to be split.

<Note>The sum of the quantities of the split items must not exceed the total quantity of the line item.</Note>

## Split Line Items Initialization

All information from the original item is copied to the split items except for the item ID, quantity, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` timestamps. Adjustments, fees, and fulfillment can be copied to split items based on configuration. The default setting is `NONE`, meaning these elements aren't copied to split items unless specified.

The following code sample provides an example for split line items request payload:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
      {
          "quantities": [2,1],
          "adjustmentsBehaviour": "COPY",
          "feesBehaviour": "COPY",
          "fulfillmentBehaviour": "COPY"
      }
  ```
</Accordion>

The `quantities` array allows users to specify the number and quantity of split items. The total number of split items is `quantities.size + 1`.\
In this example, a line item with `6` units and `quantities` set to `[2, 1]` splits into `3` items with `quantities [2, 1, 3]`, where the last quantity represents the remainder. With `adjustmentsBehaviour`, `feesBehaviour`, and `fulfillmentBehaviour` set to `COPY`, adjustments, fees, and fulfillment details from the original item are copied to each split item.

The quantities array lets users specify the number and quantity of split items. The total number of split items will be `quantities.size` plus 1.

For example, if a line item has 6 units and quantities is `[2, 1]`, it will be split into 3 items with quantities `[2, 1, 3]`, where the last quantity is the remainder.

The following code sample provides an example for split line items request payload with the `quantities`:

### Split line items request payload

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
      {
          "quantities": [2,1],
          "adjustmentsBehaviour": "COPY",
          "feesBehaviour": "COPY",
          "fulfillmentBehaviour": "COPY"
      }
  ```
</Accordion>

## Examples

### The item is available in limited quantities at multiple warehouses

Use the [split line items](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/item-actions/split) endpoint to split and ship items from different locations as in the following example:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the curl example.">
  In this example, 4 units are available in Warehouse A, and the remaining units are in Warehouse B.

  ```curl
  curl --location '{{modular_cart_domain}}/carts/9877b7ab-092d-4d67-ad42-b070ac778df8/items/806d6671-801d-4554-976d-0d38e525a852/actions/split' \
  --header 'x-fabric-tenant-id:  {tenantId}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
      "quantities": [4,5],
      "adjustmentsBehaviour": "COPY",
      "feesBehaviour": "COPY",
      "fulfillmentBehaviour": "COPY"
  }'
  ```

# Configuring Taxes
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/configuring-taxes



This feature in Carts API allows users to levy taxes on resources such as items, fulfillment, and fees. Fees are optionally taxable.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed sequentially to configure a fulfillment.

1. [Create a cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts).
2. [Create a fulfillment](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment/create-fulfillments) to add fulfillment taxes.
3. [Create an item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) to add item taxes.
4. Create either [item](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/item-fees/create-item-fees), [fulfillment](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment-fees/add-fulfillment), or [cart fees](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fees/create-fees) to add fee taxes.

### Tax Initialization

You can add taxes on the cart, cart fees, cart fulfillment, items, item fees, item fulfillment, and fulfillment fees through a single request. To ensure that fees are subject to tax, the fees should be marked as taxable.

You can apply taxes at multiple levels, including individual items, fulfillment, or fees. The tax resource maintains a consistent structure across all levels.

The following code sample provides an example of tax object structure in request payload:

### Tax resource

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
      {
          "amount": 4.0,
          "attributes": {
              "rate": 5,
              "message": "5% tax"
          }
      }
  ```
</Accordion>

For accurate tax calculation, address information is required. While items, fulfillment, and their fees already have associated addresses from the fulfillment information, the cart fee requires a separate field for the address to be provided.

The following code sample provides an example tax object structure in a request payload with the `destinationAddress` and `originAddress`:

### Tax fee resource with addresses

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON example.">
  ```json
      {
          "amount": 4.0,
          "attributes": {
              "rate": 5,
              "message": "5% tax"
          },
          "taxDetails":{
          "destinationAddress": "{{destinationAddressId}}",
          "originAddress": "{{originAddressId}}"
          }
      }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Click to expand the JSON and curl example.">
  Ensure that fulfillment fees are set to taxable.

  ```json
  {
      "id": "d4e9f8dc-c0ae-4ef3-be8b-bd23579a4dd3",  // feeId
      "name": "fulfillment-fee",
      "price": {

# Getting Started with fabric Carts API
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/developer-guide/getting-started



This guide provides instructions to help you get started with fabric Carts API, from initial setup to basic usage.

## Target Audience

* Third-party developers who set up Carts on behalf of merchants.
* The fabric developers who work with Carts.

### Knowledge and skill requirements

The target audience should:

* Understand [REST APIs](https://fabric.inc/blog/developer/api-endpoint), in the context of e-commerce.
* Get familiar with [fabric APIs](/v3/getting-started/api-guides/getting-started-with-fabric-apis).
* Know the cart [configuration](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/configuration-behaviors) and [merge](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/merge-carts-behaviors) behaviors.
* Have access to development tools capable of interacting with HTTP-based APIs, such as Postman or cURL for testing.

## Workflow

The following steps outline the Carts process, from creating a cart to generating an order draft:

1. [Create an empty cart](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/carts/carts) for shoppers to add products for purchase.
   You can customize the cart settings by sending configuration details in the request body. Otherwise, the default settings apply. For more information about cart configuration behaviors, see [Configuration Behaviors](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/configuration-behaviors) section. If the initial request is successful, a response body containing cart information, such as `cartId` and configurations is returned.
2. [Create a destination address](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/addresses/create-addresses) to fulfill the order in the cart.
   You can [delete](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/addresses/delete-addresses) or [update](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/addresses/update-addresses) the address. If the initial request is successful, a response body that contains the address information is returned.
3. [Create all the necessary fulfillment](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment/create-fulfillments) information for the cart. <br />
   You can [partially update](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment/add-fulfillments-attribute) or [delete](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment/delete-fulfillments-attribute) fulfillment attributes, [fully update](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment/update-fulfillments) fulfillments, or [delete them entirely](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/fulfillment/delete-fulfillments) if needed. If the initial request is successful, a response body containing fulfillment information is returned.
4. [Add items](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/items) to the cart. <br />
   You can [update](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/update-items) or [delete](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/items/delete-items) items in the cart. If the initial request is successful, a response body that contains the cart information, including the items that are added, is returned.
5. (Optional) [Apply any eligible coupons](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/coupons/add-coupons) for the cart. <br />
   Use [remove the coupon](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/coupons/remove-coupons) endpoint to remove coupons if necessary. If the initial request is successful, a response body that contains the cart information, including the coupon information, is returned.
6. [Add tax rules](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/validations/add-tax) for the cart. Look up the usage as tax rates vary by location. You must apply the appropriate taxes for each area. <br />
   If the initial request is successful, a response body that contains cart information with the updated tax rates is returned.
7. [Add a payment method](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/payments/add-payment-attributes) for the cart. <br />
   You can [partially update](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/payments/add-payment-attributes) or [delete payment attributes](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/payments/delete-payment-attributes) and [fully update](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/payments/update-payments) or [delete payment methods entirely](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/payments/delete-payments). If the initial request is successful, a response body containing payment information is returned.
8. [Create an order draft](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/order-drafts/create-order-drafts). If the payment is authorized, then the order is shipped. <br />
   If the initial request is successful, the response containing all the necessary information for an order to ship is returned. Before submitting the order details, ensure that all the information for the order is correct.


# Overview

### Carts 3.0

fabric's Cart API is used to add, update, and remove items from your Storefront cart, either as a guest or logged-in user. It also supports merging carts when transitioning from a guest to a logged-in user, and applying coupons and other attributes, such as gift wrapping, to line items. The API supports advanced features like using multiple carts within a B2B organization, sharing carts, and providing a unified cart experience for multi-region and multi-brand businesses.

The Cart API supports configurability for end-to-end order processing actions by adding items to the cart, handling pre-checkout tasks like billing, shipping, and payment details, and proceeding to checkout, where orders are processed and confirmed by fabric's Order Management System (OMS).

Cart 3.0 is modular, enabling users to select only the necessary endpoints. It integrates seamlessly with both fabric and non-fabric services.

### Cart orchestrator

If you're using other fabric services, you can leverage the Cart Orchestrator endpoints for seamless integration with those services.

### Contact and support

If you have any additional questions, please reach out to the Cart support team at [support.cnc@fabric.inc](mailto:support.cnc@fabric.inc).

## Configuration

The Configuration page allows you to make changes related to how order and transaction information is shared between Dropship and BigCommerce.

### Enable or disable webhooks

The following webhooks are available for BigCommerce and can be enabled or disabled at any time:

| Webhook         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Orders**      | fabric automatically sends purchase orders from your supplier partners directly to your BigCommerce account. Enabling this webhook means that orders from ALL of your supplier connections in fabric will flow through this webhook.   |
| **Inventory**   | Dropship requires frequent inventory updates to reduce cancellations due to low or no stock. The inventory webhook syncs inventory with Dropship automatically. Turn this webhook off if you prefer to update inventory manually.      |
| **Fulfillment** | Dropship requires frequent order fulfillment updates to track orders. The fulfillment webhook syncs order fulfillment data with Dropship automatically. Turn this webhook off if you prefer to update order fulfillment data manually. |

## Webhook History

To access the **Webhook History** page, follow the steps outlined in [Accessing Integration Options](#accessing-integration-options).

The Webhook History page shows details of all the events that have been captured by Dropship from your BigCommerce store:

* **ID:** The ID of the webhook as captured by Dropship.
* **Topic:** The topic that was captured as part of the webhook.
* **Status:** The status of the webhook (success or failure).
* **Payload:** The data that was sent in the webhook payload.
* **Received:** The timestamp of when the webhook was captured. This is in the user’s local time zone.

<Note> You can use the filters at the top of the table to adjust the webhook information you see. </Note>

### Safety Stock

To help prevent overselling, fabric Dropship offers a feature called Safety Stock. This feature automatically reduces your visible inventory by a pre-defined amount, effectively showing customers a lower stock level than what is physically available. By doing so, Safety Stock helps you avoid potential oversells and subsequent order cancellations. For example, if a supplier has 5 units on-hand for an item but Safety Stock is enabled for that specific supplier with a value of 3, customers would only be able to purchase 2 out of the 5 units.

The fabric Dropship integration seamlessly integrates with fabric Catalog and fabric Orders.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have **Administrator** privilege to fabric. For more detailed information on these settings, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) topic.

* You must have a tenant enabled with fabric Product Catalog or Orders & Inventory to configure and use the Dropship fabric integration.

## Mapping Product Catalog Data for Dropship

Product data doesn't automatically sync from Dropship to Product Catalog. You must publish your product data to Product Catalog after updates have been made in Dropship. For product mapping to be successful, the following steps are required:

1. Product Catalog must be configured.

   To set up Product Catalog, follow the steps outlined in the [configuring Product Catalog developer](/v3/product-catalog/api-reference/product-catalog/developer-guide/configuring-product-catalog) guide. Make sure to follow step 2 and 3 when configuring product catalog.

   If you already have product catalog configured skip to step 2.

2. Ensure the same attributes found in your Dropship template exist in Product Catalog.

   To view a list of attributes in Product Catalog, visit the [searching and sorting product attributes](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/attributes/searching-and-sorting-product-attributes) guide.

3. Ensure the same categories in your Dropship template exist in Product Catalog.

   To manage your categories in Product Catalog, visit the [managing categories](/v3/product-catalog/user-guides/product-catalog/categories/managing-categories) guide.

You are now ready to configure the fabric integration.

2. In the **Orders** section, click **Disable Integration**.

### Safety Stock

To help prevent overselling, fabric Dropship offers a feature called Safety Stock. This feature automatically reduces your visible inventory by a pre-defined amount, effectively showing customers a lower stock level than what is physically available. By doing so, Safety Stock helps you avoid potential oversells and subsequent order cancellations. For example, if a supplier has 5 units on-hand for an item but Safety Stock is enabled for that specific supplier with a value of 3, customers would only be able to purchase 2 out of the 5 units.


# Loop Integration
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/integrations/loop-integration



The Loop Dropship integration seamlessly integrates with fabric Catalog and fabric Orders.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have **Administrator** privilege to fabric. For more detailed information on these settings, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control-orders-roles) section.

## Configuring the Integration

1. Submit a support request to [fabric customer success](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the following details:
   * `Loop_api_key` (Required)
   * `Loop_webhook_secret` (Required)
   * `Loop_rma_number_mapping` (Optional): The default mapping is with the `id` of the return. Retailers can use this option to map other values such as `order_name`. This field's value is set as the return merchandise authorization **RMA** number in Dropship.
   * **Return to vendor warehouse** (Optional): Loop doesn't provide data on where the return is being shipped by default. The return to vendor warehouse credential is used to set up the shipping address on the return. Choose one of the following options:
     * **True**: Create the return address on RMA to be set to the vendor's warehouse.
     * **False**: RMA is created without any `shipTo` address. A tracking number is still available but no shipping address.
   * Select one of the following webhooks:
     * **Return Created**: This is the standard webhook for returns. Loop provides the `return_created` event and an RMA is created in fabric dropship.
     * **Return Updated**: This webhook enables you to create a return without an initial tracking number allowing you to later update the return with the tracking number once available.

<Note> Loop doesn't support automatic enabling of webhooks for their API. Once set up, you need to manually enable the webhook on the Loop dashboard. </Note>

If a return fails to sync, fabric can identify the return based on the Webhook History ID, Order Number, or return ID. fabric will then retry retrieving the return information again.


# Dropship Shopify Integration
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/integrations/shopify-integration



Integrate your fabric Dropship account with your Shopify account.

## Adding the Shopify Integration

1. To access your Dropship Integrations, click your account name.

2. In the dropdown that appears, select **Merchant Settings**.

   The **Merchants Settings** page is displayed.

3. Click **Integrations**.

   The **Integrations** page is displayed.

4. Click **Add Integrations**.

   The **Add Integrations** page is displayed with a number of tiles.

5. Click the **Shopify** tile.

   The **Add Shopify Integration** window is displayed.

6. Do the following:

   * In the **Shopify Store URL** field, provide your store name.
   * In the **API Key** field, provide your Shopify API key.

7. Click **Add Integration**.

   After you enter your Shopify credentials in Dropship, you are directed to Shopify’s website.

Once your credentials are entered and the app is installed, you are ready to begin configuring the various settings of your integration.

## Accessing Integration Options

1. To access your Dropship Integrations, click your account name.

2. In the dropdown that appears, select **Merchant Settings**.

   The **Merchants Settings** page is displayed.

3. Click **Integrations**.

   The **Integrations** page is displayed.

4. Next to the Shopify logo, click **Options**.

   The **Options** window is displayed.

5. Edit one of the following:

   * [Configuration](#configuration): The **Configuration** page allows you to make changes to the basic Shopify setup.
   * [Webhook History](#webhook-history): The **Webhook History** page shows a list of previous webhook callbacks.
   * [Utilities](#utilities): The **Utilities** page is used to update and sync order/inventory data.

## Configuration

To access the **Configuration** page, follow the steps outlined in [Accessing Integration Options](#accessing-integration-options).

## Orders

Configure how your Shopify store syncs orders with fabric.

When you enable a Shopify orders webhook, fabric automatically imports customer orders that contain items from your approved suppliers and distribute purchase orders to suppliers through their preferred integration method (Console, EDI, API, etc). When suppliers ship items, fulfillments and tracking numbers will be automatically synced back to the original customer order in your Shopify store account.

1. To choose when fabric imports customer orders, click the **Select Webhook** field.

2. Choose one of the following options:

   * **Order Paid (Recommended)**
   * **Order Created**

3. Click **Enable Integration**.

To disable the order integration, click **Disable Integration**.

### Holding orders for a set time

Sometimes you will place and order on hold for a specified time to allow for product recommendations, opt in/outs, or a validation period.

In this case, fabric can enable the orders webhook **Orders Updated**. fabric will take this additional webhook into consideration when syncing orders from Shopify and wait for the holding period.

### Fraudulent order protection

You can specify and configure whether you want to import orders flagged by Shopify as High or Medium risk.

Enable this service if you would like to skip medium-risk orders as recommended by Shopify. High-risk orders are always skipped. The field is **Disabled** by default.

1. To enable this service, select **Enabled** from the fraud field.

2. Click **Save Preference**.

For additional protection against fraudulent orders, you can enable the **Orders Paid** webhook to identify when an order should be pulled. Third-party fraud detection apps typically don't detect fraud until an order is moved to **Paid** status.

fabric Dropship has the ability to include a delay when pulling orders (in seconds, minutes, or hours) to add extra protection against fraud.

### Location

Set which inventory location to use when syncing inventory.

When fabric updates inventory in Shopify, we have to assign the inventory to a location that's configured in your Shopify account.

fabric recommends setting up a new, dedicated dropship location in order to keep your owned inventory separate from your dropship inventory. For more information on how to do that in Shopify, check the Shopify Help Center.

1. To choose an inventory location, select the **Select Shopify Location** field.

2. Click **Save Location**.

### Inventory

fabric allows you to configure how your Shopify store syncs inventory with fabric. With this feature enabled, fabric can automatically sync supplier inventory movements to your Shopify store.

1. To choose how fabric syncs orders, use the **Select Webhook** field.

2. Choose the **Product/Inventory Updated (Recommended)** option.

3. Click **Enable Integration**.

To disable inventory integrations, click the red **Disable Integration** button.

### Safety Stock

To help prevent overselling, fabric Dropship offers a feature called Safety Stock. This feature automatically reduces your visible inventory by a pre-defined amount, effectively showing customers a lower stock level than what is physically available. By doing so, Safety Stock helps you avoid potential oversells and subsequent order cancellations. For example, if a supplier has 5 units on-hand for an item but Safety Stock is enabled for that specific supplier with a value of 3, customers would only be able to purchase 2 out of the 5 units.

## Webhook History

The Webhook History page shows a list of previous webhook callbacks. To access the **Webhook History** page, follow the steps outlined in [Accessing Integration Options](#accessing-integration-options).

To inspect a webhook, click the webhook ID. The **Inspect Webhook** window has basic information about the webhook including any messages the webhook returned, and the script used to fetch the webhook.

## Utilities

To access the **Utilities** page, follow the steps outlined in [Accessing Integration Options](#accessing-integration-options).

### Retry Order

If an order didn't import into fabric, its likely that there was a problem routing the order to the correct supplier. If you have doubled-checked the SKUs and the Shopify mappings, you can attempt to import the order again by supplying the **Shopify Order Number**.

1. To import the order, enter the order number into the **Shopify Order Number** field.

2. Use the fraud checkbox to toggle whether you would like to ignore Shopify’s fraud risk recommendation.

3. Click **Retry Order**.

### Push Inventory

This utility pushes inventory for all synced items from a specified connection. Use the dropdown to select the connection and click **Push Inventory** to kickoff the sync process.

### Sync Variants by Vendor

This utility attempts to sync variants between Shopify and fabric using a vendor name. It searches your Shopify store for all items created within the date range you specified and then attempts to sync them with variants in fabric. fabric checks if the Shopify variant's SKU field matches the Merchant SKU, the UPC, or the Supplier SKU (in that order).

1. Use the **Select Date Range** field to choose whether you would like to look for products created between two given dates, or run a sync against all products (a process that can be very slow).

2. Click **Run Sync** to begin the process.

### Sync Variant

Use this utility to sync variants between Shopify and fabric using a fabric **Item ID**. Enter a value in the **fabric Item ID** field and click **Run Sync**, and fabric will search your Shopify store for any items matching using the Merchant SKU, Vendor SKU, and/or UPC.

* **Variant-Level Metafields:** You can publish Metafields and their values at the variant level.
* **Additional Metafield Types:**  Support for additional Metafield types such as `multi_line_text_field`, `boolean`, `URL`, and `date_time`.

### Data Override on Publish

Any publish to Shopify action overrides the data for products and variants in Shopify with the data in Dropship. Empty attributes aren't sent over.

* **Extras** - This section provides miscellaneous information against the order.
  * A direct link to the order packing slip; Dropship automatically generates a packing slip for each order once an order has been created within the platform.

Typically errors will occur when attempting to push to suppliers Shopify’s due to the following:

* The SKU on the order doesn't exist in the suppliers Shopify. Examples include:
  * The SKU was changed in the suppliers Shopify but wasn't updated in fabric Dropship.
  * The SKU was removed from the suppliers Shopify due to it being discontinued.

* The SKU on the order is duplicated in the suppliers Shopify.
  * Although fabric recommends that each SKU is unique in a suppliers Shopify, fabric understands that this can't always be the case. When there is a duplicate variant in the suppliers Shopify, the supplier will need to confirm what Shopify Variant ID fabric Dropship should sync to.

If an error is available for your suppliers orders, please reach out to the supplier directly to have them work with fabric support.

# Import Products & Attributes
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/products/import-products---attributes



Suppliers send product details to their retail partners either through proposals within the fabric Dropship system or through spreadsheets that retailers use to create Import Requests, based on their connection settings with the supplier.

As a retailer, upon receiving products in your catalog from the supplier, you may need to update some of the products' information before publishing them to your store. This is done by updating the items using the **Import Products & Attributes** feature.

## Procedure

Click **Products** in the menu across the top of Dropship. On the Products page, select **Import Products & Attributes**.

On the **Import Products** page, use the **Select Template** dropdown to select a template for the products you’re importing. This will ensure that the data in the file you import is mapped to the product in your store correctly.

Use the Download Empty Template and/or Show Headers buttons to verify you’re uploading to the intended template and format. To learn about templates and how to create them, refer to the [Templates](/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/settings/templates) page.

Upload the product spreadsheet using the **Select File** field and click **begin import**.

If there are errors present in the template file the following files are made available:

* **A list of SKUs:** For every import with one or more errors, an Error Report file is generated. This report includes all SKUs and provides an itemized list of errors corresponding to each SKU.

* **A template with only errored items:** A separate file is generated that includes only the items with one or more errors. This allows you to fix these specific items and re-import them without needing to handle the entire original file again.

Once the import is complete, you will see a summary of the import process, including its status.

## Import History

To see a list of all product spreadsheets uploaded previously, visit the Products page and click on the **History** link next to **Import Products & Attributes**.

The Import History page shows a sortable list of all previous imports.

# Categories & Commission Profiles
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/settings/categories---commission-profiles



The Categories feature in fabric Dropship allows retailers to organize products into groups and set different commission rates for each group of products.

Categories can then be used to create Commission profiles for different supplier partners on the Dropship to maximize commissions.

## Categories

To access Categories, click on your account name in the menu at the top of Dropship and select **Retailer Settings** in the menu that appears. On the Settings page, scroll to the bottom and select **Categories**.

The Categories page displays a table of all the Categories you’ve created previously, with a quick look at the ID, Category Name, Number of Items in the Category, and the Last Updated date.

To create a new Category, click the **Add New Category** button at the top-right of the page. In window that appears, give the new Category a name and click **Save**.

To rename or delete an existing Category, find it in the list of Categories you’ve created previously, click on the corresponding vertical ellipsis icon (⋮), and then click Rename or Delete. Please note that Category names must be unique and only Categories with no items can be deleted.

**Please Note:** Your Suppliers will be able to see all the Categories you create and any products you assign to them.

### Adding Products to a Category

In Dropship, categories are attributes of a product, similar to a product’s name, description, color, etc. Like these other attributes, categories are set up in the CSV file of your products that you import into Dropship. To learn more about this process, visit the Import Products & Attributes page.

## Commission Profiles

To access Commission Profiles, click on your account name in the menu at the top of Dropship and select **Retailer Settings** in the menu that appears. On the Settings page, scroll to the bottom and select **Commission Profiles**.

The Commission Profiles page displays a table of all the Commission Profiles you’ve created previously, with a quick look at the Profile Name, Suppliers, and Method.

### Creating a Commission Profile

To create a new Commission Profile, click the **Add New Profile** button at the top-right of the page.

On the Create Commission Profile page, give the new profile a name and a description, and select a method for the Commission Profile, either **Flat Commission %** or **Commission by Category**.

* **Flat Commission %:** Specify a commission rate to be applied to all items, regardless of their category.
* **Commission by Category:** Enter a commission rate for each category. **All Categories** is selected by default and used for any items without a category. Click **Add Categories** to set up custom commission rates on a per-category basis.

When you’re finished setting up your Commission Profile, click **Save**.

### Managing Commission Profiles

## Best Practices for Commission Profiles

To use Commission Profiles effectively, consider the following best practices:

* Set commission rates that align with your business goals and help you maximize profits.
* Use category-specific Commission Profiles to set different commission rates for different categories of products.
* Keep Commission Profile names and descriptions clear and descriptive to help you identify them later.


# Proposal Departments
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/settings/proposal-departments

Standardize product data rules for all suppliers across various categories.

## Overview

When retailers are sourcing products in various categories from their suppliers, it becomes essential for them to be able to differentiate product attributes and their validations for each category.

A proposal department enables retailers to set any number of categories and apply different validations on each one, making it easy to implement control over the quality of data their suppliers share.

A proposal department enforces the rules of a product import template and two predefined rulesets on every proposal before a supplier can send proposals to the retailer.

Status

* Active - An active Proposal Department is available for all suppliers of the retailer.
* Disabled - You can set the status of a department to Disabled if you don’t want to use this anymore.

## Create a Proposal Department

To access the Proposal Department, login to your dashboard, select **Retailer Settings**, then **Proposal Department,** then **Create.**

Enter the name of the proposal in **Department Name**

Select a **Product Import Template**

* Every proposal department requires the product import template to identify the list of attributes for the proposal department
* A retailer can only select from the existing list of templates.

Select a **Supplier Ruleset**

* You will be able to see a list of existing rulesets
* Select the ruleset that all items must be compatible with when being added to a proposal

NOTE: Supplier ruleset is also applied on all items during the compatibility check of every proposal.

Select a **Retailer Ruleset**

* You will be able to see a list of all existing rulesets
* Select the ruleset that the items must be compatible with when being accepted from a proposal

NOTE: The retailer ruleset is applied on the all items of a proposal during the compatibility check before it can be sent over to the retailer for a review

Select a **Sample Template URL** (optional step)

* Dropship gives retailer the capability to provide a ready template to their supplier that can be referenced while creating the spreadsheet for a proposal.
* You can simply upload the file on your server and add a URL here. This will make the file available for the supplier while creating a proposal. Please reach out to fabric Support if you need support in uploading the sample file to fabric’s server.

Select **Save.**


# Rulesets
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/settings/rulesets

Set the conditions and validations used by the Proposal Department.

## Overview

A ruleset is a set of conditions that can be applied to a proposal through the feature called Proposal Departments. A ruleset consists of multiple rule groups. Each rule group can have multiple rules configured where each rule dictates the conditions for an individual attribute.

* Retailers and suppliers use rulesets to dictate the terms of a proposal department
* Rules set under a ruleset are applied to all items and attributes during a proposal
* Proposal compatibility will check all the items from the template and apply the rulesets on them. Only validated items will be added to the proposal
* Every retailer must have at least 2 rulesets, one to be used as Retailer ruleset and one to be used as suppliers ruleset. Refer to [Proposal Departments](/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/settings/proposal-departments) for more details.

### Create a Ruleset

To create a ruleset, login to your dashboard, select **Retailer Settings**, then **Product Rulesets,** then **Create Ruleset.**

Enter a **Name** and **Description** of the ruleset.

Click **Create** and the new ruleset will appear in the list.

To configure a Rule Group in a Ruleset, click on the **Ruleset Name** you created.

Click on Create inside the **Rule Group** section and complete the dialog box

* **Name** - Name of the Rule Group. This represents the group to which the attribute belongs. For example, all identifier-related attribute rules can be part of the a single group called Identification.

* **Description** - An optional description of the Rule Group.

Click **Save**.

A single Ruleset can have any number of Rule Groups.

Click **Save**.

A single Rule Group can have any number of rules.

A validator Enables retailers to set more complex validations on their attributes.

Once a rule is added, validators can be added to it.

* Multiple validators are available to be added, however, only one validator can be added per rule.

To add a validator, click **Add** next to the rule inside the list.

Select the validation **Type** from the dropdown menu.

Enter the relevant expression in **Value.**

Click **Save.**


# Settings
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/settings/settings

Add users and configure notifications in Dropship.

## Introduction

To access Retailer Settings, click on your account name in the menu at the top of the page. In the dropdown menu that appears, select **Retailer Settings**.

Use the tiles on the Retailer Settings page to manage everything from general information and user privileges to API clients and webhook settings.

## Default Onboarding Preferences

Manage the default onboarding settings for all new suppliers.

The settings you configure here will be the default settings for all new connections. You can always override these settings when inviting a new connection.

Each of these preferences is set for a new vendor automatically. These preferences can be changed for an individual vendor by going to their Connection Details Page.

### Default Cost Determination

All incoming items on a purchase order must have an associated cost to the retailer. Use the **Cost Method** dropdown menu to make a selection:

**Specified on Platform:** Dropship is responsible for capturing the cost in this scenario. For Proposals, an attribute called “Cost” becomes mandatory for all of a supplier’s items. It's implemented through rulesets being used by Proposal Departments and requires that suppliers define the value for the “Cost” attribute for every item when creating a proposal. For Import Requests, the same “Cost” attribute becomes mandatory for all items created by the retailer, and retailers won't be able to send import requests without the “Cost” attribute.

**Specified on Order:** The retailer is responsible of providing the value of “Net Price” with every order they create in Dropship. Orders created without “Net Price” or “Retailer Price” will be rejected by the system.

**Commission:** The retailer must specify the commission amount. Dropship will automatically calculate the cost to be paid to the supplier based on the retail price in every item. Retailers need to provide the “Retail Price” while creating an order in Dropship. Any order without the Retail Price will be rejected. The net price will be calculated based on the commission and retail price.

After making a selection, click the **Save Preference** button.

### Default Fulfillment SLA

The Fulfillment SLA governs how long suppliers have to ship orders before they're considered late.

Use the dropdown to choose whether suppliers have one, two, or three business days to ship orders once they receive the order.

After making a selection, click the **Save Preference** button.

### Default Payment Terms

The retailer pays the cost of all the items on a purchase order. The Payment Terms reflect how long the retailer has in credit days before that amount is due to the supplier. For example, if set to Net 15, the retailer will need to remit the supplier within 15 days of invoice receipt.

Use the dropdown to make a selection and then click the **Save Preference** button.

### Default Catalog Import Method

The catalog import method defines how suppliers share their product catalog with you.

Selecting **Import Requests** requires you to upload a spreadsheet on behalf of your suppliers and subsequently seek their approval to publish the products.

Selecting **Proposals** requires suppliers to submit products to you for approval.

After making a selection, click the **Save Preference** button.

### Default Customer Service & Returns Allowance

Setting a customer service & returns allowance on a connection automatically applies an adjustment to all new incoming supplier invoices, decreasing the amount the retailer owes the supplier.

This allowance is typically applied to offset the costs of returns and other costs associated with servicing a customer.

To set a default returns allowance for any new connections automatically, enter a value between 0 and 10% and then click the **Save Preference** button.

### Packing Slip Template

Including a retailer-branded packing slip is often an important component of the customer experience. The default packing slip will include your logo and core order data including the customer order number.

If you have worked with fabric Support to configure a custom packing slip, please provide the template name and click the **Save Preference** button.

## Currency Settings

# Templates
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/settings/templates

Keep data consistent between internal and external systems

## Overview

Templates are a key feature of Dropship that facilitates the data exchange of Dropship with other external systems.

To access the templates, login to your dashboard, select **Retailer Settings**, then **Product & Inventory Templates.**

These templates are specific to the retailer and come in two varieties, product and inventory.

### Product Templates

* Pre-existing list of global attributes that's shared by all items and all businesses.
* Retailers can use their own attribute names for the spreadsheets and will be able to see these names on the Dropship platform UI
* Templates are mappings between the Dropship attributes and the attributes names defined by the retailer
* Import templates are responsible for data ingestion into Dropship
* Export templates can be used for extracting data from Dropship.
  * This allows the retailer and their suppliers to generate spreadsheets that match the template as required by other systems such as Shopify, fabric Product Catalog, and others.

### Retailers and Suppliers can create and clone templates

Retailers

* Retailers can create templates for importing and exporting products.
* Retailers templates are also accessible by all of their suppliers.
* Retailers can clone a template by selecting the clone option on the template details screen.

    * The sample file should only contain the header row of the spreadsheet you want to be using for the said operation
    * Once you upload the file, you will be asked to map the attributes

### Map Attributes

Dropship automatically tries to map user-uploaded attributes with those of fabric Dropship, however, all mapping needs to be checked by the user before creating the template. There are certain attributes that are relevant for most dropship businesses and need to be mapped and added to capture key details related to dropship products.

You can accept the values Dropship offers or enter your own for each column.

Column Header - the name of the attribute in your file

Map To - the name of the corresponding fabric Dropship attribute

* You should be able to find a similar attribute in the dropdown
* In case you can’t find a match for your attribute in the list provided by fabric, please raise a request to support team

Level - this indicates whether this is a parent or individual item attribute

* This field is only relevant for an import template
* Defines whether the attribute is relevant for the product (the parent item) or its variants
* Most attributes are relevant for items
* Attributes that leveled to Products will be inherited by all of the variants automatically

Priority - dictates the order in which the attributes will appear everywhere in the platform UI and during the exports

Required - indicate if this is a mandatory or optional attribute

* This field is only relevant for product import templates.
* If an attribute is mandatory in the import template, items without that attribute will show an error when imported through into Dropship.

# Supplier Payment
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-retailers/suppliers/supplier-payment

Track supplier invoices and payments

## Overview

Dropship enables retailers to create payments for the invoices generated by their suppliers. One payment can only contain invoices coming from a single supplier. Retailers will be able to pool multiple invoices together and create a single payment draft and add its details such as check number, check amount, and the date of payment.

Please note that this feature only facilitates creating payments against invoices to keep a record of supplier remittances. The feature doesn’t involve movement on money.

## Create Payments

To create a payment, select **Reports** in the top header, then **Payments.**

Click on **Create Payment**

Use the **Select Supplier** dropdown menu to select the recipient for the payment, then click **Continue**.

You can select the invoices to be added individually, or use the **Filter** to narrow the list to a specific range.

Browse the list, or search for invoices, then select the checkbox next to it.

After the selection is complete, click on **Actions** and **Add Invoice.**

You can also **Search** for existing payments or see a list of **Draft** and **Completed** payments.

### Adding credits to the payment

You can also add any existing credits to a payment. Credits are the amount a supplier has already been compensated with. This amount will be subtracted from the total invoice amount.

Once you have your invoices selected a payment in the **Payment Detail** screen, select the **Add Credits** link to the left.

Select the **Credits** from the list, then click **Actions**, **Add Credits.** In the confirmation dialog, select **Save**.

### Adding adjustments to the payment

To add an adjustment to a payment, select **Adjustments** in the **Payment Detail** screen, select the **Add Adjustment** button.

Select the kind of adjustment from the dropdown menu, enter the **Amount** and a **Description**. Click the **Save** button. If you need to modify or delete the adjustment, click the **Edit** link.

### Adding Check Information

Once all invoices, credits and adjustments are added, a final amount of payment will be automatically calculated.

Go to **Payment Summary Page**, to see the summary and check information.

Click on **Edit** and add the check information

* Provide Check number
* Check Amount

# Bulk Actions for Orders
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/dropship/dropship-suppliers/fulfillment/bulk-actions-for-orders



## Introduction

With the Bulk Actions features in Dropship, you can perform actions that affect multiple orders.

This document is divided into two sections: **Open Orders** and **Canceled Orders and Backorders**.

## Open Orders

This section outlines the steps to perform bulk actions on open orders, including printing pick tickets, reprinting shipping labels, reprinting packing slips, and manually accepting orders.

To begin, navigate to the **Orders** page in Dropship, and click one of the tiles under **Open Orders**.

On the Orders page, find the orders you would like to print a pick ticket for and click the corresponding checkboxes at the left to select them.

After you select the Orders, click the **Actions** dropdown and take the following steps based on the action you need to perform.

### Print Pick Ticket

The pick ticket differs from a packing slip. A packing slip is required for all Retailer orders and contains all of your required information. A pick ticket provides a “pick list” of the order line information with your supplier SKU information and total ordered quantity. This can be helpful if your Retailer uses a retailer SKU on the packing slip instead of your internal supplier SKU.

Select **Print Pick Tickets** from the Actions dropdown.

In the popup that appears, you will be able to download and/or print your pick tickets.

### Reprint Shipping Labels

If shipping labels are being generated directly in fabric Dropship, you can reprint them at any time.

Select **Print Shipping Labels** from the Actions dropdown.

In the popup that appears, you will be able to download and/or print your shipping labels.

### Reprint Packing Slips

To reprint a packing slip for a specific order or batch of orders, select **Print Packing Slips** from the Actions dropdown.

In the popup that appears, you will be able to download and/or print packing slips.

### Manually Accepting (Acknowledging) Orders

To accept (also called acknowledge) an order or a set of orders, select **Accept Orders** from the Actions dropdown.

In the popup that appears, you will see an overview of the orders you selected. Click **Accept All Orders** to confirm.

Once the orders have been accepted, the status will change from **Ready** to **OK**.

## Canceled Orders and Backorders

This section outlines the steps to perform bulk actions on orders that require attention, including canceled and backordered orders.

### Manually Accepting (Acknowledging) Canceled Orders

When orders are canceled by a Supplier, Retailers have the ability to acknowledge the cancellation. If you don't have an automated integration with the fabric Dropship Platform, you can acknowledge canceled orders manually within the platform.

Navigate to the **Orders** page and click **New Cancels** in the **Requires Action** section of the **Orders** dashboard.

In the list of canceled orders, **click the checkbox** beside the canceled order you would like to acknowledge.

Click the **Actions** dropdown at the top of the list and select **Acknowledge Cancels**.

Click the **Acknowledge All Cancels** in the popup window to complete the process.

### Managing orders with backordered Items

When items in an order are marked as backordered by a Supplier, Retailers have the ability to acknowledge the backorder. If you don't have an automated integration with the fabric Dropship Platform, you can acknowledge orders with backordered items directly within the platform.

Navigate to the **Orders** page and click **New Backorders** in the **Requires Action** section of the **Orders** dashboard.

In the list of backorders, click the **blue PO# link** to open the order detail page.

On the order detail page you can view the date the supplier expects the item to be back in stock in the **Key Dates** section.

You can then acknowledge the backorder by clicking the **Acknowledge Backorder** button at the top of the page.


# Fulfillment

Process and ship orders from all connected retail partners.

## Overview

To navigate to the **Orders** dashboard, login to the Dropship Platform and click **Orders** on the top menu bar.

The three main sections within the **Orders** Dashboard are: Open Orders, Reports, and Require Attention.

**Open Orders** - contains four pre-filtered buckets of dropship orders

* Open Orders - a list of all open orders
* Current Orders - a list of open orders that are within your fulfillment SLA
* Past Fulfillment SLA - a list of open orders that are past your fulfillment SLA
* Late Invoices - a list of open orders that have shipments but remain open due to missing invoices.

**Reports** - contains pre-filtered reports for various order details

* Orders with New Messages - Browse the latest order notes from your partners
* Shipments & Tracking - Review shipments & tracking numbers
* Returns - Track returns and RMAs
* Invoices - Review all invoices from suppliers

**Require Attention** - contains two pre-filtered buckets to manage cancellations and backorders

* New Cancels - a list of cancellations that require acknowledgement by you, the Supplier
* New Returns - a list of orders that have a return associated with them.

<Note>Clicking on any of the pre-filtered buckets within each of the main sections of the **Orders** dashboard will provide a list view of all orders that fit within the pre-filtered criteria. All data from any page containing a list view of orders can be exported by clicking on the **Export** link on the upper right side of each page. If any additional filters are applied to the page, the export will contain all orders that fit the filter criteria. </Note>

### Manage Orders in Bulk

1. To access the bulk operations page, click **Manage Orders in Bulk**.

   The Bulk Operation Details Page is displayed with available workflow actions.

2. Click one of the following fields:

   * **Cancel Entire Orders by PO Number**

   This operation cancels all orders of the given Purchase Order Numbers. To use this operation, the following mandatory fields are required: **Purchase Order Number**, **Retailer ID**, and **Cancellation Reason Code**.

   * **Cancel specific order lines by SKU**

   This operation cancels all order lines when given the purchase order of a given SKU. For example, if orders include an item that's now discontinued or is OOS, you can cancel just those items. To use this operation, the following mandatory fields are required: \*\* PO Number\*\*, *SKU* and **cancellation reason code**. If **Quantities** isn't provided, the default action cancels all quantities in that order.

   * **Cancel all order lines of specific SKU**

   This operation cancels all order lines of the given SKU. For example: A vendor can upload a template with the **SKU** affected and the **Cancellation Reason**. Then all orders containing the affected SKUs have those SKUs cancelled instead of going into each order individually. To use this operation, the following mandatory fields are required: **SKU** and **Cancellation Reason Code**.

<Note> Only the specific SKUs are canceled when an order contains multiple order lines with different SKUs. </Note>

Summary is the default view of the Retailer Detail menu. There are five sections: Connection Detail, Payment Settings, SLAs, Contacts, Settings, Connection Notes, and Invoice Adjustments.

#### Connection Detail

The Connection Detail section displays the following information:

* **Retailer:** The retailer’s name
* **Retailer #:** The retailer’s number
* **Retailer ID:** The retailer’s ID
* **Integration Type:** The integration type the retailer used
* **Catalog Import Method:** The method of catalog sharing you used to for this specific retailer
* **Welcome Call Date:** The date the retailer had their scheduled welcome call with fabric Dropship
* **Packing Slip Template:** The type of packing slip the retailer uses to fulfill the supplier’s orders

You can make your playbook and other assets available to all supplier partners through the portal. To do this, you need to share the assets with the fabric team. The assets are then uploaded to your account and suppliers are able to access this information on the connection details page.

#### Payment Settings

The Payment Settings section displays the following information:

* **Cost Tracking:** the cost method the retailer is using for this specific connection
* **Payment Terms:** The payment terms the retailer follows for the Purchase Orders you fulfill. There are five payment terms available: Net 15 Days, Net 30 Days, Net 45 Days, Net 60 Days, and Net 90 Days.

#### SLAs

The SLAs section shows the number of days you have to fulfill any order you receive so that you meet the SLA criteria.

#### Contacts

The Contacts section displays the following information:

* **Primary:** The primary point of contact at the retailer’s business
* **Merchandising:** The merchandising point of contact at the retailer’s business
* **Fulfillment:** The fulfillment point of contact at the retailer’s business

#### Settings

The information in the Settings section is set by your retailer partner.

* **Ship from Retailer:** If the supplier generates Shipping Labels from fabric Marketplace, enabling this option will populate the "ship from" on all shipping labels with a merchant return address. Some carriers might not respect this address, so it should be viewed as cosmetic only.
* **Auto-populate Invoice Data:** If enabled, all the invoices will be generated automatically as soon as the order is fulfilled. Only the invoice number will be left blank. Enabling this feature may reduce invoicing discrepancies, but suppliers won't be able to submit custom adjustments.
* **Require Pricing Approval On Proposals?:** If the retailer/supplier connection is using Proposals as the Catalog Import Method, enabling this option will require the extra step of approving Pricing before the proposal is accepted.
* **Include 850 In Packing Slip?:** If the supplier has an EDI integration in place, enabling this option will include the packing slip in the EDI 850 document.
* **Auto Invoice And Close Order When Fulfilled:** If this option is enabled, as soon as an order is fully shipped, the invoice is automatically generated and the order is closed. This is different from “Auto-populate Invoice Data,” which doesn't close the order. This option overrides the settings done for “Auto-populate Invoice Data.”

#### Connection Notes

The Connection Notes section keeps any notes left by fabric staff and retailers to store critical information or decision taken while onboarding or during business with the retailer.

The visibility of these notes can be set by the retailer based on the business requirements. As the supplier, you can only view the notes you have permission to see.

#### Invoice Adjustments

The Invoice Adjustments section stores the default adjustments set for the particular connection with your retailer partner.

As a supplier, you may need various adjustments on the invoices, such as shipping fees, service fess, or other types of charges incurred while fulfilling the order.

You may also have to pay certain charges on your retailer partner such as return allowances, damages etc.

To edit these settings, contact your retailer partner.

### Attributes

To visit the **Attributes** menu, select Attributes from the navigation at the left of the Retailer Detail page. You will be able to see any attributes your retailer partner might have stored related to their connection with you.

### Carriers

The Carriers menu is where the retailer designates the Shipping Accounts the supplier is able to use. To visit the Carriers menu, select **Carriers** from the navigation at the left of the Supplier Detail page.

Retailers can approve any number of Shipping Accounts to be used by you as their supplier. Once approved, you will be able to ship an order using your Shipping Accounts.

If you don’t have any carriers listed here, [you might need to set up your own carriers](/v3/dropship/dropship-suppliers/settings#shipping-accounts).

### Assets

Retailers can now make their playbook and other assets available to all supplier partners through the portal. They need to share the assets with the fabric team, which can upload them on their account and suppliers will be able to access them on the connection details page.

## Introduction

Welcome to fabric Dropship. This guide will walk you through the supplier onboarding workflow.

## Welcome Email

The Dropship onboarding process begins with a welcome email that contains a unique link to Dropship that will connect you to your retail partner.

<Note> If you are having trouble finding your invitation email, start by checking your spam folder. If you still can’t find the invitation email, ask the retailer who invited you or your fabric onboarding specialist to resend the invitation email. If you still don’t receive the email, reach out to [fabric Support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new). </Note>

After clicking the link to begin the onboarding process, you are directed to the **Sign Up** screen.

Once you have completed initial account setup and logged in, you will need to complete the [onboarding tasks](#onboarding-tasks) to finish the onboarding process.

## Onboarding Tasks

After your onboarding call, you will need to complete the onboarding tasks to finish the onboarding process.

However, if one cart has a 10% discount and the other has a 20% discount, the merge can't happen exactly due to conflicting coupon functions.

## Merge Results

### Validations merge

* **Behavior for line item validation**: Inherited from [`mergeBehavior.item.behavior`](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/cart-actions/merge).
* **Behavior for product catalog validation**: Inherited from [`mergeBehavior.item.behavior`](/v3/cart-and-checkout/api-reference/carts-v3/cart-actions/merge).

When carts are merged, promotions are cleared due to updated items, quantities, taxes, or fulfillments in the cart. Additionally, a state is added to refresh the promotions.

### Taxes

Taxes follow the same rules as the parent item. For example, if the item merge rule is set to secondary, the respective taxes are included accordingly.
When the item merge rule is set to `MERGE`, taxes are cleared, and a state is added to the cart indicating that the item is missing taxes. This adjustment is necessary because changes in quantities may require tax updates.

### Item quantity behavior

Item merge behaviors are:

* **Default (SUM)**: Quantities of items with the same SKU are summed.
* **MAX**: The highest quantity of items with the same SKU is selected.

### States

You must fully re-evaluate the state object for the merged cart from the response body to ensure the merged cart is configured with the intended settings.

# Overview
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/integrations/overview



fabric supports integrations with many of its core applications such as Product Catalog, Orders, Inventory, Cart, Checkout, and more. Integrations make working with your choice of a technical vendor easy without the need for custom code.

### Standard integrations

fabric has a set of pre-built standard integrations. These standardized integrations cover common use cases making them easy to set up. Standard integrations don't support customizations to the code but can be configured within 24 hours. The following standard integrations are currently supported:

* [Stripe Connector](/v3/integrations/stripe-connector)
* [Algolia Connector](/v3/integrations/algolia-connector)
* [Constructor.io Connector](/v3/integrations/constructor-io-connector)
* [Avalara connector](/v3/integrations/avalara-connector)

Custom integrations aren't supported at this time.

### Security

fabric takes security seriously and always follows the recommended standards. AWS secret manager handles all the values passing between the standard connectors and keeps everything encrypted. Additionally, fabric uses each connectors official SDK to send and receive encrypted data.

### Monitoring

Currently, fabric monitors all the standard integrations internally by a number of metrics such as latency. It's encouraged to use a standard integrations respective dashboard to receive more direct monitoring metrics. For example, to confirm a standard integration connector is working as intended, you can check the respective connectors dashboard. The dashboard displays changes that should be happening such as product information updates or payments.

### Contact and support

If you have any additional questions, please reach out to [fabric customer success](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new).

# Overview

The Alerts feature in fabric Copilot notifies you of potential issues using the data within your account. You can use these notifications to identify and respond to system errors or data anomalies that could impact business operations. For example, you can set up alerts for high order failure rates, abnormal dips in prices, published SKU counts dropping significantly, and transactional failures.

You can subscribe to receive alerts by email when an event occurs, and view alerts on the **Alerts** dashboard in Copilot. Users with shared access to your organization’s account can view the alerts you set up and optionally subscribe to them.

Setting up and configuring alerts requires **Administrator** privileges in Copilot. For more detailed information on these settings, see [Role-Based Access Control](https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/guides/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control).

## Use Cases

Common use cases for alerts within fabric’s applications include:

* **Orders:** Alert that flags orders that might negatively impact trailing metrics, such as returns and cancellations.
* **Inventory:** Alert that creates a notification for any issues updating your inventory records.
* **Product Catalog:** Alert that creates a notification whenever a product information import fails.

## Alert Components

Creating an alert involves setting up three main components: the **Alert trigger conditions**, **Look-back period**, and **Severity threshold**.

### Alert Trigger Conditions

Alert trigger conditions consist of a series of statements that define the circumstances that trigger an alert. In these statements, you establish the components of an alert by selecting a fabric application, a service within that application, an attribute of that service, an operator, and a value for which you would like to set up the alert. When configuring these statements, you can use a variety of parameters, such as order statuses, inventory levels, and transaction outcomes, to create customized trigger conditions that meet your specific monitoring requirements.

It's important to note that when you are setting up an alert in Copilot, the values displayed in each field are entirely dependent upon the selection in the previous field.

The following table outlines the fields in the Alert trigger conditions section, and their values.

| Field Name     | Description                                                                                                     | Values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Alert trigger conditions example

As an example of how you can use the fields in alert trigger conditions to create statements, consider the Payments Failure Alert template. It’s an alert that’s generated from the Orders application whenever an invoice fails.

There are two statements required to create this alert; an **if** statement and an **and** statement. The **if** statement simply says, “if the Orders app invoicing service created an invoice more than two hours ago.” To create this statement in the alert trigger conditions, the **if** statement is configured as follows:

* **App:** is set to **Orders**
* **Service:** is set to **Invoice**
* **Attribute:** is set to **createdAt**
* **Operator:** is set to **GT**
* **Add value:** is set to **NOW() - PT2H**

This statement tells Alerts where to look and when, but what it’s looking for - the failed invoice - is incomplete. The **and** statement finishes the alert trigger condition by describing the type of invoice to look for. It says, "the status of the invoice includes the values `_failed_` or `_settlement failed_`." To create this statement in the alert trigger conditions, the **and** statement is configured as follows:

* **Service:** is set to **Invoice**
* **Attribute:** is set to **statusCode**
* **Operator:** is set to **IN**
* **Add Values:** is set to **FAILED** and **SETTLE\_FAILED**

Understanding alert trigger conditions is crucial for setting up effective alerts in your fabric applications. By configuring both `if` and `and` statements, you can specify the exact conditions that trigger an alert.

#### Adding and removing conditions

When creating an alert from scratch, you can refine your alert trigger conditions by adding **and** statements. This allows for even more nuanced and targeted alerting, so that you can specify combinations of attributes, operators, and values that must be met to trigger an alert. However, every condition for all your statements must be met to trigger the alert, which means too many **and** statements could cause you to miss an event that you want to monitor.

### Look-Back Period

The look-back period is the timeframe that fabric considers when assessing data for potential alerts.

For instance, if an alert is configured to trigger when order processing times exceed a certain threshold, the look-back period could be defined as the past 24 hours. In this scenario, fabric examines order processing times over the last day to determine if the current processing time deviates significantly from the average.

Configuring the look-back period helps provide context to alerts. A shorter look-back period may capture recent changes or sudden spikes in activity, while a longer look-back period can help identify sustained trends or recurring issues.

### Severity Threshold

The **Severity threshold** is the term for the required number of events to occur for an alert to be considered low, medium, or severe.

* **Low Severity:** Alerts with a low severity threshold are triggered when the specified event occurs infrequently. These alerts typically highlight events that might require attention but may not be of immediate concern.

* **Medium Severity:** A medium severity threshold indicates a moderate frequency of the event. Alerts in this category often point to events that may warrant closer monitoring due to their increased occurrence as a potential issue that should be addressed.

* **High Severity:** Alerts with a high severity threshold are triggered when the specified event reaches a significant frequency. These alerts usually require immediate attention, as they typically signify critical events or issues that require prompt resolution to prevent impact on business operations.

You can configure the severity threshold numbers to tailor alerts to your specific needs.

Keeping with the example of the Payments Failure Alert, you could set the **Low Severity** field in this template to five. This will generate a low severity alert when five payments have failed within the time frame you specified. From there, you could set **Medium Severity** to 10, so that a medium severity alert would be generated when 10 payments fail within your time frame. Setting **High Severity** to 15 would generate high severity alert when 15 payments have failed within your time frame.

You will need to adjust the severity thresholds until you get the alert dialed in to your needs. Typically, you want to avoid infrequent or minor events and focus on frequent and severe events. Adjusting the severity threshold will help you strike a balance between being notified of potential issues and avoiding unnecessary alert fatigue.

## Templates

You can use templates to set up alerts quickly without having to configure each trigger condition manually. These templates have pre-configured trigger conditions for common operational events, such as failed payments. With the predefined triggers for situations that often require immediate attention, you can address potential issues before they escalate into bigger problems.

# API Apps
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/api-apps



### Overview

API apps allow multiple software programs to exchange data and make it easier for developers to create applications that leverage external resources and capabilities.

fabric authenticates and authorizes API requests using your account’s API keys. When using any of fabric’s APIs through an API client, you must include an API key as part of the requests. These keys are used to validate the permissions and access rights associated with the client before allowing access to a specific merchant's data.

Copilot has two types of API apps:

* System App: Generates an access token using a client ID and client secret to identify itself and to communicate with other systems. System Apps don't use fabric Identity to authenticate end users, instead use system-to-system communications with fabric APIs. If you want to use your own identity provider, you must create a System App.
* User App: Uses fabric Identity to authenticate end users. A user app relies on the login page that fabric Identity hosts for end users to log in. User apps are used by e-commerce apps that use fabric Identity for their authentication and authorization.

For more information about user apps and system apps, see the [APP Types](/v3/getting-started/authentication-v3/concepts#app-types) section.

### Terminologies

The following terminologies are used when creating or managing fabric API apps:

* **App Name:** The name of the app.
* **Role:** The scope of permissions for the app.
* **User Pool:** The user directory where user credentials are stored.
* **Redirect URL:** The URL the user should be redirected to after successful authentication.
* **Logout URL:** The URL the user should be redirected to after logout.
* **Authorization URL:** The URL to which the user will provide their client id and client secret to. If authorization is successful, then the user will be redirected to their redirect URL with an access token.
* **Client ID:** Public identifier of an app.
* **Client Secret:** The Secret known only to your application and the authorization server used to authenticate the app.

# Managing User Scope
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/platform/settings/user-management/managing-user-scope



With fabric’s role-based access control settings, you can restrict which users are authorized to manage or access certain parts within each tenant.

## Key Concepts

| **Term**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**      | A person who has access to your organization’s tenant. Each user can have one or more roles and scopes that control what they can access.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Scope**     | A set of rules that determine which resources a user can access. Scopes are defined using attributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Attribute** | A specific property or key-value pair that helps define access rules within a scope. For example *brand: Nike* or *region: North America*. Attributes in the context of scope represent resource characteristics or user permissions. Users are assigned attributes based on their roles or responsibilities. |
| **Resource**  | An asset or entity within the fabric Copilot app, such as Offers or Orders, that can be accessed or managed by users. Resources have attributes that define access permissions, determining which users can view or manage them based on their assigned scope.                                                |
| **App**       | A functional module or service within fabric that organizes related resources. Apps provide specific capabilities and manage resources, such as promotions in the Offers app.                                                                                                                                 |

## Scope Logic

The logic for determining access in user access management follows a [union principle](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Union_Principle#:~:text=The%20Union%20Principle%20is%20a,the%20%22any%20piece%22%20problem.), ensuring flexibility when managing user access to resources.

### Key rules for scope

Attributes are assigned to users as part of their role or scope settings. Copilot administrators define attributes when configuring access levels. A user might receive attributes based on factors such as:

* Their department or team. For example, *region: North America*.
* The brands they manage. For example, *brand: Nike*.
* Their role-specific permissions. For example, *category: Electronics*.

Users without scope attributes:

* Can access all resources, regardless of the resource's attributes.
* New users start with full access until a scope is assigned.

Users with multiple scope attributes:

* Can access a resource if any of their attributes match the resource's attributes.
* Can access a resource if any of the user’s attributes is a partial match with the resource's attributes.
* Can't access a resource if none of the resource's attributes match with user's attributes.

These rules provide a balance between controlled access and flexibility, ensuring users can access appropriate resources based on their scope.

### Example Scenarios

| **Case**                                                   | **User's Scope**  | **Resource's Attributes** | **Access** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| User has a brand, and the promotion has the same brand.    | `brand: Nike`     | `brand: Nike`             | ✅ Granted  |
| User has no brands, and the promotion has brands.          | No brand assigned | `brand: Adidas`           | ✅ Granted  |
| User has no brands, and the promotion has no brands.       | No brand assigned | No brand assigned         | ✅ Granted  |
| User has a brand, and the promotion has no brand.          | `brand: Nike`     | No brand assigned         | ✅ Granted  |
| User has a brand, and the promotion has a different brand. | `brand: Nike`     | `brand: Adidas`           | ❌ Denied   |

# Getting System App Credentials
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/getting-system-app-credentials



System App generates an access token to establish its identity by using a [client ID](#client%5Fid) and [client secret](#client%5Fsecret). Unlike regular user applications, system apps don't rely on fabric identity for authenticating end users. Instead, they employ system-to-system communication with fabric APIs to fulfill their intended functionalities and services. This topic provides step-by-step instructions to get the setting required for a system app to complete the authentication.

## Prerequisite

Ensure that a [system app is created](/v3/guides/settings/api-apps/creating-system-app) for your account. You must have [admin rights](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control) to create a system app in Copilot. For more information on creating system apps, see the [Creating a System App](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/creating-system-app) section.

## Procedure

1. Log in to your Copilot account.
2. In the left menu, click **Settings > Developer Tools**.
3. Click **API Apps**.\
   The API Apps page is displayed. This page provides a list of apps created in your account. The **app type** field specifies whether the application is a user app or system app.
4. Click the name of the **system app** that's already created for your account.\
   The details of the system app is displayed.
5. Make a note of the following settings:
   * **Authorization URL**: A unique URL for each fabric merchant and is common across all system apps defined for a single merchant.
   * **Client ID**: Public identifier of an app.
   * **Client Secret**: The Secret known only to your application and the authorization server used to authenticate the app.\
     These values are required for authentication of your system app and to start using fabric APIs. For more information about these settings, see the [API Apps](/v3/platform/settings/api-apps/api-apps) page.

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control



## Overview

With role-based access control in fabric, you can control and limit the access to information and actions based on the roles assigned to the users. Each user can be assigned multiple roles,  such as products editor and orders and inventory editor. By assigning roles, you can prevent unintended changes or data entry errors through the Copilot accounts.

fabric offers the following roles to enhance security and data integrity:

* **Admin:** Invites other users and assigns them roles, as well as reassigns roles to existing users. The admin can also revoke user access from the account.
* **Developer Admin**: View and manage integration configurations.
* **Developer Viewer**: View integration configurations.
* **Restricted Admin:** Assigns and modifies the roles of other users. Restricted admin can also view the content in fabric applications, but can't modify them.
* **Editor:** Creates and manages content in all fabric applications available to their Copilot account.
* **Experiences Editor:** Creates and manages content within the Experiences application. However, this user group can't publish content to the Storefront.
* **Offers Editor:** Creates and manages content within the Offers application.
* **Orders & Inventory Editor:** Creates and manages content within the Orders and Inventory applications.
* **Products Editor:** Creates and manages content within the Products application.

# Adding a Webhook
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/platform/settings/webhooks/adding-a-webhook



## Overview

Webhooks are real-time notifications that enable communication between different software systems and trigger automated processes. For example, for your online store, you can set up a webhook to alert you whenever a new product is added.

Using fabric Copilot's webhook functionality, you can create event subscriptions to monitor operations between fabric apps and external systems, such as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or Content Management Systems (CMS).

# Managing Events and Logs
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/platform/settings/webhooks/managing-events-and-logs



## Overview

The logs provide you with a comprehensive overview of events with the details, such as event date, type, subscriptions name, log type, status, and endpoint.

The detailed view of an event log provides more information, such as the status code of the event, its name, the name of the subscription it's linked to, the endpoint URL, the number of attempts made, the version of the event and when it got triggered, the time it was delivered, the details of the request, and the response details. You can use these information to track and troubleshoot issues during event operations over the last seven days.

You can search for a specific event and filter events based on date, event type, status code, or subscription name. You can  also sort the logs by clicking a specific field in the top menu or selecting a particular option within that field.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Developer Admin** or **Developer Viewer** privileges. For more information, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control) topic.

## Viewing Logs

1. In the left menu, click **Settings** > **Developer Tools**.
2. Click **Webhooks**.\
   The **Webhooks** page is displayed.
3. Click the **All logs** tab.\
   The logs of all event are displayed.
4. To view the log details of an event, hover over the row of the event.
5. On the far right of the row, click the **Event Details** icon.\
   The **Event information** page displays the following information:
   * **Status Code**
   * \*\*Name of the event \*\*
   * **Subscription name**
   * **URL endpoint**
   * **Attempts**
   * **Event version**
   * **Triggered at**
   * **Delivered at**
   * **Request Details**
   * **Response details**\
     If you want to resend the event, you can click the **Resend** button.
6. To close the detailed view, click **Close**.

## Replaying Events

You can use the replay feature to resend all events for a specific subscription within a designated date range to diagnose any event failures during that period. For example, if you want to investigate the delivery failure of one or more events from a specific period, you can replay all events recorded during that time frame. Note that, you can only replay events recorded during the last seven days.

### Procedure

# Webhooks
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/platform/settings/webhooks/overview



## Overview

Webhooks are real-time notifications that enable communication between different software systems and trigger automated processes. For example, for your online store, you can set up a webhook to alert you whenever a new product is added. Using fabric Copilot's webhook functionality, you can create event subscriptions to monitor operations between fabric apps and external systems, such as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or Content Management Systems (CMS).

These real-time notifications can be configured for specific events, such as product updates, order creation, or abandoned carts, and directed to a designated HTTP endpoint.

<Note> Webhooks aren't enabled by default. To enable webhooks, contact [fabric support](https://support.fabric.inc/hc/en-us/requests/new). </Note>

Most webhooks actions require **Developer Admin** privileges. Users with **Developer Viewer** privileges can view webhooks. For more information, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control) topic.

# Testing a Webhook
Source: https://developer.fabric.inc/v3/platform/settings/webhooks/testing-a-webhook



## Overview

We recommend testing your webhook after creating them to ensure the proper functioning and integration of your subscriptions. This topic provides instruction to test the webhook URL with example data.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a webhook, ensure that you have **Developer Admin** privileges to test webhooks. For more information on privileges, see the [Role-Based Access Control](/v3/platform/settings/rbac/role-based-access-control.mdx) topic.

## Procedure

1. In the left menu, click **Settings > Developer Tools**.
2. Click **Webhooks**.\
   The **Webhooks** page is displayed.
3. Click the name of the webhook.\
   The webhook details page is displayed.
4. Click **Test webhook**.\
   The **Test** page is displayed.
5. In the **Event to test** dropdown, select an event to test.\
   If no dropdown is available, skip to the next step.
6. Click **Run Test**.

Depending on the webhook configuration, one of the following response with the result of the test is returned, indicating whether the test was successful or not:

* **200 Ok**
* **400 Bad request**
* **401 Unauthorized**
* **404 Subscription/Event type not found**
* **500 Internal Server Error**

The following provides a list of possible reasons webhooks can fail.

| Troubleshooting step      | Verification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reception confirmation    | Confirm whether the webhook is successfully received at your endpoint, for example, by inspecting the request object.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Source validation         | Confirm that the incoming request originates from the expected source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Payload content check     | Make sure that the webhook contains the expected alerts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Data type validation      | Validate the data types of the received information. In some instances, data may be formatted differently from what your server expects. For example, a boolean value sent as a string could lead to unintended issues. If necessary, transform the data to match your server's expectations. |
| Event verification        | Ensure that the webhook corresponds to the anticipated event and the endpoint isn't associated with the wrong event type.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Response evaluation       | Assess how your API responds to the webhook. Make sure that the webhook is processed correctly, and that the appropriate status codes are returned as required by your application.                                                                                                           |
| Authentication validation | Webhooks might fail if you don't fulfill their authentication criteria. Ensure that you adhere to the authentication protocols as set up in the **Authorization** field of the **Add Webhook** page in Copilot.                                                                               |

Each fulfillment starts at the pick phase where you search for the requested items. **Item Options** can be used to manually scan items, look up product info to help find items in the store, and cancel a specific item without canceling the entire order.

1. Click an item in a fulfillment to display the **Item Options** window with the following options:

* [Manually pick](#manually-pick-an-item)
* [Product info](#lookup-product-info-for-an-item)
* [Cancel item](#canceling-a-single-item)
* [Gifting](#gifting-options)
* [Unpick item](#unpicking-an-item)

### Manually pick an item

The **Manual Pick** option allows you to change the quantity of items expected for a fulfillment.

<Note>This shouldn't be used to cancel items but adjust errors in the fulfillment itself.</Note>

1. Click the item.

   The **Item Options** window is displayed.

2. Click **Manually Pick**.

   The **Manually Pick** window is displayed.

3. Click the quantity icon to open the **Manual Pick** window.

### Lookup product info for an item

You can lookup product info such as the **SKU**, **Style Number**, **Size**, **Color**, and other important attributes for any product in a fulfillment. The number of available attributes can vary and depends on a product's available information.

1. Click the item.

   The **Item Options** window is displayed.

2. Click **Product Info**.

   The **Product Info** window is displayed.

### Unpicking an item

While changing shifts or completing fulfillments that carried over to another day, sometimes items can be misplaced. If you notice a discrepancy in picking, you can unpick an item while you search for it. This isn't the same as canceling an item. Unpick allows you to  reset the instance of a single item without starting the entire fulfillment over. Only once you have confirmed the item isn't available should it be canceled.

For example, let's assume an order has 4 pants, 5 shirts, a backpack, and 3 pairs of socks. Employee A says they picked all the items and hands it over to employee B during a shift change. Employee A accidentally sold one of the pairs of socks they had picked for the order just before the shift change. When employee B counts the socks they notice that only 2 are picked, not 3. A line of customers has formed and they can't look for the missing socks at this moment. To prevent another employee from packing or completing the order, they unpick the socks as a reminder to find all 3 pairs before packing and shipping the fulfillment.

1. To unpick an item, click the item.

   The **Item Options** window is displayed.

2. Click **Unpick Item**.

   The **Do you want to unpick this item?** confirmation window is displayed.

3. Click **Yes**.

The items pick quantity is reset to 0 for that item.
