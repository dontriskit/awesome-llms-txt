# Introduction to Argil's Webhook Events
Source: https://docs.argil.ai/pages/webhook-events/introduction

Learn what webhooks are, how they work, and how to set them up with Argil through our API.

## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when something happens. In the context of Argil, webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about various events occurring within your environment, such as video generation successes and failures or avatar training successes and failures.

## How Webhooks Work

Webhooks in Argil send a POST request to your specified callback URL whenever subscribed events occur. This enables your applications to respond immediately to events within Argil as they happen.

### Available Events for subscription

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Video Generation Success">
    This event is triggered when an avatar video generation is successful.<br />
    Check our [VIDEO\_GENERATION\_SUCCESS Event Documentation](/pages/webhook-events/video-generation-success) for more information about this event.

# AI actions - Special B-rolls
Source: https://docs.argil.ai/resources/ai-influencer-actions

How to create influencer alive in different scenes with consistency

<Note>
  This will ONLY work when you select an avatar created with the builder
</Note>

### What is it?

When you pick an avatar made thanks to the builder, you can make it do all sorts of actions as B-rolls. While your avatar is talking about its day, you can illustrate each one of them with a specific video.

We automatically generate images based on your script, no need to prompt it.

<Note>
  The actions are videos but **you can only preview an image**. Each image is the first frame of the video. The video will be visible after clicking on generate on the top right (10-15 minutes).
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Paste a script and pick &#x22;AI actions&#x22; as B-rolls">
    ![Captured’écran2025 04 02à19 21 26 Pn](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/argil/images/Captured%E2%80%99e%CC%81cran2025-04-02a%CC%8019.21.26.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add new B-rolls">
    If you want to illustrate a clip with no B-roll, simply pick "AI action" in the B-roll options and shuffle through the option. Then click "generate". \
    If that clip already has a B-roll selected, you can click on the "bin" symbol to regenerate new options.

  <Accordion title="What is the &#x22;avatar royalty&#x22;?" defaultOpen="false">
    At Argil, we are commited to give our actors (generic avatars) their fair share - we thus have a royalty system in place with them. By measure of transparency and since it may evolve, we're adding it as a separate pricing for awareness.

# Editing tips
Source: https://docs.argil.ai/resources/editingtips



Editing will transform a boring video into a really engaging one. Thankfully, you can use our many features to **very quickly** make a video more engaging.

<Tip>
  Cutting your sentences in 2 clips and playing with zooms & B-rolls is the easiest way to add dynamism to your video - and increase engagement metrics
</Tip>

### Use zooms wisely

Zooms add heavy emphasis to anything you say. We <u>advise to cut your sentences in 2 to add zooms</u>. Think of it as the video version of adding underlining or bold to a part of your sentence to make it more impactful.&#x20;

Instead of this:

```
And at the end of his conquest, he was named king
```

Prefer a much more dynamic and heavy

```
And at the end of his conquest
[zoom in] He was named king
```

### Make shorter clips&#x20;

In the TikTok era, we are used to dynamic editing - an avatar speaking for 20 seconds with nothing else on screen will have the viewer bored.&#x20;

Prefer <u>cutting your scripts in short sentences</u>, or even cutting the sentences in 2 to add a zoom, a camera angles or a B-roll.&#x20;

### Add more B-rolls

B-rolls and media will enrich the purpose of your video - thankfully, <u>you don't need to prompt to add a B-roll</u> on Argil. Simply click the "shuffle" button to rotate until you find a good one.&#x20;

<Note>
  B-rolls will take the length of the clip you append it to. If it is too long, toggle the "1/2" button on it to make it shorter&#x20;
</Note>

### Create an avatar with body language

Your AI avatar will be <u>much more engaging</u> if it can convey more expressivity through expressions and movement. Thankfully, our Pro clients can add body language & expressivity segments to their avatars.

# Moderated content
Source: https://docs.argil.ai/resources/moderated-content

Here are the current rules we apply to the content we moderate. 

<Info>
  Note that content restrictions only apply to Argil’s avatars. If you wish to generate content outside of our restrictions, please train your own avatar ([see how](https://docs.argil.ai/resources/training-tips))
</Info>

On Argil, to protect our customers and to comply with our “safe synthetic content guidelines”, we prevent some content to be generated. There are 2 scenarios:

* Video generated with **your** avatar: no content is restricted

* Video generated with **Argil’s avatars**: submitted to content restrictions (see below)

***

### Here’s an exhaustive list of content that is restricted:

You will not use the Platform to generate, upload, or share any content that is obscene, pornographic, offensive, hateful, violent, or otherwise objectionable, including but not limited to content that falls in the following categories:

### **Finance**

* Anything that invites people to earn more money with a product or service described in the content (includes crypto and gambling).

**Banned:** Content is flagged when it makes unverified promises of financial gain, promotes get-rich-quick schemes, or markets financial products deceptively. Claims like "double your income overnight" or "risk-free investments" are explicitly prohibited.

**Allowed**: General discussions of financial products or markets that do not promote specific services or methods for profit. Describing the perks of a product (nice banking cards, easy user interface, etc.) not related to the ability to make more money.

### Illicit promotion

* Promotion of cryptocurrencies

* Promotion of gambling sites

**Banned:** Content is flagged when it encourages risky financial behavior, such as investing in cryptocurrencies without disclaimers or promoting gambling platforms. Misleading claims of easy profits or exaggerated benefits are also prohibited.

**Allowed**: General discussions of financial products or markets that do not promote specific services or methods for profit. Promoting the characteristics of your product (card

### Criminal / Illegal activies

* Pedo-criminality

* Promotion of illegal activities

* Human trafficking

* Drug use or abuse

* Malware or phishing

**Banned**: Content is banned when it provides explicit instructions, encourages, or normalizes illegal acts. For example, sharing methods for hacking, promoting drug sales, or justifying exploitation falls into this category. Any attempt to glorify such activities is strictly prohibited.

### Violence and harm

* Blood, gore, self harm

* Extreme violence, graphic violence, incitement to violence

* Terrorism

**Banned**: Content that portrays graphic depictions of physical harm, promotes violent behavior, or incites others to harm themselves or others is not allowed. This includes highly descriptive language or imagery that glorifies violence or presents it as a solution.

### Hate speech and discrimination

* Racism, sexism, misogyny, misandry, homophobia, transphobia

* Hate speech, defamation or slander

* Discrimination

* Explicit or offensive language

**Banned**: Hate speech is banned when it directly attacks or dehumanizes individuals or groups based on their identity. Content encouraging segregation, using slurs, or promoting ideologies of hate (e.g., white supremacy) is prohibited. Defamation targeting specific individuals also falls under this category.

### **Privacy and Intellectual Property**

* Intellectual property infringement

* Invasion of privacy

**Banned:** Content that encourages removing watermarks, using pirated software, or disclosing private information without consent is disallowed. This includes sharing unauthorized personal details or methods to bypass intellectual property protections.

### **Nudity and sexual content**

**Banned:** Sexual content is banned when it contains graphic descriptions of acts, uses explicit language, or is intended to arouse rather than inform or educate. Depictions of non-consensual or illegal sexual acts are strictly forbidden.

### **Harassment**

**Banned:** Harassment includes targeted attacks, threats, or content meant to humiliate an individual. Persistent, unwanted commentary or personal attacks against a specific person also fall under this banned category.

### **Misinformation** and fake news

**Banned:** Misinformation is flagged when it spreads false narratives as facts, especially on topics like health, science, or current events. Conspiracy theories or fabricated claims that could mislead or harm the audience are strictly not allowed.

### **Sensitive Political Topics**

**Banned:** Content is banned when it incites unrest, promotes illegal political actions, or glorifies controversial figures without nuance. Content that polarizes communities or compromises public safety through biased narratives is flagged.

**Allowed:** Balanced discussions on political issues, provided they are neutral, educational, and avoid inflammatory language.

###

**Why do we restrict content?**&#x20;

We have very strong contracts in place with our actors that are used as Argil’s avatars.

If you think that a video has been wrongly flagged, please send an email to [support@argil.ai](mailto:support@argil.ai) (**and ideally include the transcript of said video**).

*Please note that Argil created a feature on the platform to automatically filter the generation of prohibited content, but this feature can be too strict and in some cases doesn’t work.*

### Users that violate these guidelines may see the immediate termination of their access to the Platform and a permanent ban from future use.
