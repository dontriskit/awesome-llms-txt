## Migration from Stackup \[This guide is intended for users migrating from Stackup to Pimlico]

Welcome to Pimlico! We're excited to help you in your transition from Stackup. This guide will help you understand the migration process, the changes you'll need to make to your existing setup, and give a brief overview of new features you will have access to.

### Migration Process for Startup and Developer Tiers

If you were previously subscribed to Stackup's Startup or Developer tiers, your information has been pre-loaded onto our system for a smooth migration process.

Follow these steps to migrate to Pimlico:

:::steps
#### Go to the Pimlico dashboard

The Pimlico dashboard can be found at [https://dashboard.pimlico.io](https://dashboard.pimlico.io).

![dashboard-login](/dashboard-login.png)

#### Sign up using the email address previously used on Stackup

We have used your email address you used for Stackup to pre-load your information for a seamless migration process.

![dashboard-signup](/dashboard-signup.png)

#### Enter your card details

Once signed in, you will be prompted to enter your card details and confirm your new plan. Enter your card information to continue your subscription seamlessly.
:::

After completing these steps, your Pimlico account will be fully set up and ready to use.

### Pimlico Overview

With Pimlico, you'll have largely the same functionality as Stackup, with a few small differences and several new features.

#### Dashboard

The Pimlico dashboard offers a wide range of features to help streamline your smart account development.

![dashboard](/dashboard.png)

Dashboard features include:

* [Rich analytics and metrics](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/metrics)
* [Logs and requests overview](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/logs)
* [Debugging tools](/infra/platform/debugging/dropped-user-operations#how-to-debug-dropped-user-operations)
* [Gas grants](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies)
* [Sponsorship policies](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies)

#### API Credit system

Pimlico uses a transparent API credit system, ensuring fair billing based on your actual usage. The 'worth' of each API credit is different than it is for Stackup. The API cost of each RPC call is detailed on our [pricing page](/infra/platform/pricing).

#### API Endpoint changes

There are several API changes you may need to implement for a successful migration.

##### pimlico\_getUserOperationGasPrice

The Pimlico bundler requires gasPrices to be fetched from the `pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice` endpoint. This is necessary to ensure the UserOperation is sent with a sufficient gas price regardless of network conditions.

##### Separate RPC for node requests

The Stackup endpoint supports both standard RPC and ERC-4337 calls, but Pimlico only supports ERC-4337. During migration, you'll need a separate RPC provider for standard calls.

#### Multichain support

The Pimlico API supports seamless multichain access. This means that the same API key and sponsorship policies (if configured) can be used on all chains. The API uses a standardized endpoint structure for all networks:

```ts
const endpoint = `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/${chainId}/rpc?apikey=${apiKey}`
```

where `chainId` specifies the target chainId. The Pimlico bundler is currently live on 90+ chains, the full breakdown can be found on the [supported-chains page](/infra/platform/supported-chains).

#### ERC-20 Paymaster endpoint

If you are using Stackup's `pm_getERC20TokenQuotes` endpoint, you can migrate to Pimlico's `pimlico_getTokenQuotes`. The Pimlico endpoint does not take in a user operation, however you can follow this [how-to guide](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/how-to/use-paymaster) to achieve the same functionality.

#### Origin and user agent whitelist

If you were previously using Stackup's origin whitelist or user agent whitelist, you can apply the same settings by navigating to apikeys and clicking the edit button.

![apikey-settings](/apikey-settings.png)

### FAQs

#### Do I need to enter my billing details to start using Pimlico?

Yes, you'll be prompted to enter your billing details during the migration process. This ensures your account is fully configured and ready to use Pimlico seamlessly.

#### How do I reach out if I need help?

If you run into any issues or have any questions during the migration, feel free to reach out to us at [support@pimlico.io](mailto\:support@pimlico.io) or [directly through telegram](https://t.me/kristofgazso).


## Account Abstraction

Account abstraction is a feature that allows users to customize their Ethereum accounts with smart contract logic. It simplifies the account system by reducing Ethereum's two types of accounts (Externally Owned Accounts and Contract Accounts) to one type - Contract Accounts. The resulting contract accounts can initiate transactions, pay transaction fees, and have more flexibility and security than regular accounts.

### Why is account abstraction necessary?

Account abstraction is essential for several reasons:

* It enables users to create **smart contract wallets** with features such as multi-sig, social recovery, meta-transactions, batched transactions, gas abstraction, etc.
* It allows users to **pay transaction fees with any token or asset** they want, not just ETH. This can lower the entry barriers for new users and increase the adoption of Ethereum.
* It gives developers more **freedom and creativity** to design their account logic and user experience **without being constrained by the protocol rules**. This can foster innovation and diversity in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### How does account abstraction work?

Account abstraction allows contract accounts to specify their validation logic instead of relying on the protocol's signature verification and nonce incrementing. This means that contract accounts can decide how to authorize transactions, how to pay gas fees, and how to prevent replay attacks using smart contract code.

The leading proposal for account abstraction is [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). ERC-4337 is a specification that aims to use an entry point contract to achieve account abstraction without changing the consensus layer protocol of Ethereum. ERC-4337 simplifies the stack by modularizing the responsibilities of executing the transaction into several entities.

The different entities that make up ERC-4337 are:

* **Bundlers**: entities that collect UserOperations from users and submit them to an EntryPoint contract.
* **EntryPoint**: a contract that receives UserOperations from bundlers, validates them, pays for gas, and executes them.
* **UserOperations**: pseudo-transaction objects that are used to execute transactions with contract accounts. They contain information such as nonce, gas limit, gas price, initCode or target, data, signature, etc.
* **Wallets**: smart contract accounts that can execute transactions with UserOperations. They have logic to verify signatures, update nonces, and perform actions.
* **Paymasters**: contracts that pay for the gas fees of UserOperations on behalf of wallets. They can implement various payment schemes such as tokens, subscriptions, etc.

For a user-friendly explanation of account abstraction, ERC-4337, and smart contract wallets, we recommend the below video by Kristof Gazso, co-author of ERC-4337 and founder of Pimlico:

<iframe className="aspect-video w-full" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdaoBzwHFkU" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen />

### How does Pimlico fit in?

While all the benefits of account abstraction are already *theoretically* available, more infrastructure is needed to support this new generation of wallets.

Pimlico's vision is to be the underlying infrastructure layer that will power Ethereum's transition to smart contract wallets through mass ERC-4337 adoption.

We will initially focus on providing comprehensive infrastructure for two entities, as mentioned earlier: **Bundlers and Paymasters**, two of the most critical pieces of the puzzle missing for wallets building on top of ERC-4337.


## EIP-7702

EIP-7702 is a proposal set for inclusion in the upcoming 2025 Pectra hardfork. The proposal introduces a new transaction type that allows EOA's to assign a "delegation designator" to their account. The delegation designator points to a smart contract and when a transaction is sent to the EOA, it executes the code at the designated address.

This unlocks huge benefits for EOAs, as they can now access smart account features such as batching transactions, gas sponsorships, passkeys as signers, and more.

A full demo showing how to use ERC-4337 with EIP-7702 can be found [here](/permissionless/how-to/eip-7702-demo).

### FAQ

#### Will I be able to upgrade my wallet to any smart account implementation?

While technically possible, most wallet developers are expected to heavily restrict which smart account implementations you can upgrade to, typically limiting options to:

* Their own implementation
* A very limited set of approved smart account implementations

This restriction exists because upgrading your account with EIP-7702 effectively requires the same level of trust as handling over your private key. As a result, when implementing EIP-7702 support, you will likely need to:

1. Prompt users to upgrade their EOA wallet (e.g., Metamask) to the specific 7702 implementation that their wallet allows
2. Work within the features available through that implementation

Note: Having users provide their private key would technically allow upgrading to any implementation but is a significant security risk and is not recommended.

### How can I test it out?

You can test out EIP-7702 with Pimlico's infrastructure on the Odyssey Testnet:

For a complete guide on how to test EIP-7702, check out our [step-by-step tutorial](/permissionless/how-to/eip-7702-demo) which walks through the process of sending a sponsored userOperation from an EOA. You can also find a complete working example in our [7702 UserOp demo repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/7702-userop-demo).


## ERC-4337

ERC-4337 is the leading proposal to achieve account abstraction on EVM chains. The standard works by creating a new type of transaction, called user operartion, that special relayers called bundlers can submit through a so-called EntryPoint contract that is able to prompt smart accounts compatible with the ERC-4337 interface to check whether the smart account considers the user operation to be valid, and then execute said user operation.


## ERC-7579

ERC-7579 is a proposal that aims to standardize modular smart accounts in a minimal way to allow for continued innovation while making module interoperability between different account implementations far more achievable.

## permissionless.js FAQs

### Getting `WaitForUserOperationReceiptTimeoutError`?

This error is thrown when the bundler takes too long to bundle your user operation or the default timeout configured in permissionless.js is not enough.
This could be due to the block time of the chain you are using is more than the default timeout.

The easiest way to fix this is to increase the timeout in permissionless.js. You can do this by changing timeout value in `bundlerTransport` like so:

```typescript
const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
  account: simpleSmartAccount,
  chain: sepolia, // or whatever chain you are using
  bundlerTransport: http("<bundler_endpoint>", {
    timeout: 30_000 // Custom timeout
  })
})
```

### Can I use social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.) with permissionless.js?

Yes! While permissionless.js doesn't directly implement social logins, you can integrate third-party providers that offer social login capabilities. Popular options include:

* [Magic](https://magic.link)
* [Privy](https://privy.io)
* [Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz)
* [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io)

These providers can be integrated with permissionless.js to enable social login experiences while leveraging smart accounts for features like gas sponsorship and transaction batching. Check out our [Signers documentation](/permissionless/how-to/signers) for integration guides with these providers.

### Getting `out of gas` errors?

Such errors are thrown when the provided gas limits are not enough to execute the user operation. Usually the gas limits are calculated by the bundler. If you are getting such error, you can try setting up gas limits manually.

```typescript
const userOp = await smartAccountClient.prepareUserOperation({
    calls,
    callGasLimit: 100_000n,
    verificationGasLimit: 100_000n,
    preVerificationGas: 100_000n,
})
```

### Do I need the same saltNonce to re-initialize my Safe?

When initializing a Safe account with `toSafeSmartAccount`, if you want to get the same account address when re-initializing the Safe wallet, you must use the same `saltNonce` value that was used during the initial creation. If no `saltNonce` is specified, `toSafeSmartAccount` defaults to `0n`.

Using a different `saltNonce` will result in a different account address being generated. Here's an example of how to specify the `saltNonce`:

```typescript
const safeAccount = await toSafeSmartAccount({
    client: publicClient,
    entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7",
    },
    owners: [someSigner],
    saltNonce: 100n, // must match the original saltNonce to get the same address
    version: "1.4.1",
});
```

For more details about the `saltNonce` parameter and other configuration options, see the [reference documentation for toSafeSmartAccount](/permissionless/reference/accounts/toSafeSmartAccount#saltnonce).

### Getting `preVerificationGas is not enough` errors?

This error occurs when a userOperation is submitted with a preVerificationGas that is insufficient to cover the offchain overhead.
You might see an error message like:

```json
{
    "message": "preVerificationGas is not enough, required: 60676, got: 48550",
    "code": -32500
}
```

The `preVerificationGas` accounts for:

* Gas overhead that can't be calculated onchain
* L1 data costs when operating on L2 networks

This error typically occurs in two scenarios:

1. When calling `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` with a userOperation signature that is not the same length as the real signature.
2. When submitting a UserOperation after the bundler's preVerificationGas commitment has expired.

To resolve this issue:

1. Ensure proper dummy signature is used during estimation to ensure proper L1DataCost calculations:
   * Provide a semi-valid dummy signature that matches your final signature's length
   * The signature should be semi valid such that the validation doesn't revert

2. Account for gas estimation timing:
   * The bundler commits to the estimated `preVerificationGas` for 30 seconds
   * You should submit your UserOperation within this window to avoid insufficient preVerificationGas errors
   * If you are submitting after the window, you can add a fixed overhead to your `preVerificationGas` to increase the chances it gets included

## Why permissionless.js \[A summary of why we built permissionless.js]

### Problems

ERC-4337 has emerged as a popular standard to tackle some of the most pressing user experience issues in the Ethereum ecosystem, but the current state of tooling in the space has been lacking. Namely, no library we have seen has been able to succeed in all of the following areas: **obsessed with developer experience, built closely on top of existing tools, flexible, and vendor-agnostic**.

At [Pimlico](https://pimlico.io) we have seen a lot of developers using our infrastructure struggle with having to string many SDKs together. Instead of getting them to learn a whole new framework or building a `@pimlico/sdk`-like library that would lock the developer to our infrastructure, we decided to build a tool that would allow developers to build on top of APIs they're already familiar with any provider they wish, mixing-and-matching all of the different parts of the stack including bundlers, paymasters, smart account providers, and signers.

### Great developer experience

Developer experience is the cornerstone of permissionless.js's design. We're committed to providing strongly-typed TypeScript APIs, comprehensive documentation on every function, and an intuitive and legible style that doesn't require you to constantly jump around files to understand the code that has been written.

### Built on top of existing tools

Developers should not have to learn a completely new framework to make their apps leverage smart accounts. [viem](https://viem.sh) and [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) have established themselves as the most popular libraries for Ethereum development, so permissionless.js is built as a thin layer on top of them reusing as much of their standards and styles as possible. This means less work for us, and less work for developers who want to build with smart accounts.

### Flexible and extensible

Account abstraction is still an evolving space, and we want to make sure that developers can easily build and extend their own solutions for different parts of the stack as they see fit. If we don't support a bundler, a paymaster, a smart account provider, or a signer that you want to use, it should be trivial to swap it out for another one that implements the same interface or to build and connect your own without having to rewrite your entire app.

### Avoiding lock-in

Crypto developers don't like lock-in. In a world where the infrastructure provider whose proprietary SDK you've spent the last year building your app on can disappear overnight, you want to make sure that you can easily swap out different parts of the stack as you see fit, including that of the original creator of the library. If we as Pimlico want to see smart accounts succeed, we're going to have to build tooling that benefits the entire ecosystem, not just the users of our own infrastructure.


## Bundler FAQs

### I successfully submitted a user operation to the bundler, but it never got included in a block. What happened?

There can be many reasons for this. The most common are:

* The user operation succeeds as it is being validated, but fails during the second round of simulations when it is being bundled by the bundler into a transaction to be submitted on-chain and is therefore dropped.
* The bundle transaction bundling the user operation fails on-chain so no logs are emitted.
* You submitted a user operation which has a nonce that is higher than the current account nonce, which means it is likely queued by the bundler until that nonce is reached.

It is recommended to use the [`pimlico_getUserOperationStatus`](/infra/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationStatus) endpoint to check the status of your user operation.

### What is the difference between v1 and v2 endpoints?

V1 is for bundlers, while v2 is for paymasters. V2 for bundlers will be released soon with a notice period for migration.

### What are fees to deploy to app-chains?

Fees vary by network. Please reach out to [us](https://t.me/kristofgazso) for more information.

### Are Pimlico bundlers block builders?

Not by default, however we aim to get direct RPC access to sequencers whenever possible.

### Are there any API-related payments?

No, there are not. The only payments relate to the onchain payments through the user operation gas price for the bundler fees, and the offchain balance deduction for the paymaster fees.

### How is payment made for the bundler?

The bundler fees are paid for completely onchain, by setting a gas price for the user operation that is slightly higher than the gas price we use to bundle said user operation in our transaction.

### How does the onchain bundler payment take place?

When constructing your user operation, you'd use the [pimlico\_getUserOperationGasPrice](/infra/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice) method to select the gas prices for your user operation. When submitting to the bundler, the bundler would bundle the user operation into a transaction with a slightly lower gas price. The bundler makes as profit the small difference between the two gas prices.

### How is pimlico\_getUserOperationGasPrice different from eth\_estimateUserOperationGas?

[eth\_estimateUserOperationGas](/infra/bundler/endpoints/eth_estimateUserOperationGas) estimates the gas limits for the user operation (i.e. how much total gas can be spent for the difference stages of the user operation). In contrast, [pimlico\_getUserOperationGasPrice](/infra/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice) responds with the gas prices (i.e. for each unit of gas, what is the amount of ETH you're willing to pay to the bundler).

### Is there be a way of tracking gas fee payments?

Our dashboards provide a way for you to view data about how much you spent on sponsorship for user operations on different chains, however there is currently no specific information on the gas price overhead paid to the bundler. However, all this information is available and can be compiled onchain through block explorers like Etherscan.

If you would like more information about gas fee payments on the Pimlico dashboard, [reach out to us!](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ)

### How do gas fees for the bundler and paymaster stack?

If you use both the bundler and the paymaster together, the fee payments would stack.

For instance, if you ended up paying a 5% overhead for the bundler and a 10% overhead for the verifying paymaster on a user operation that costs us $0.01 to include, you would end up paying a total of $0.01 \* (1.05) \* (1.1) = $0.01155 => a 15.5% overhead.

Important to note however that the bundler and paymaster are completely independent and you can use one without the other.

### What is the use case for smart accounts

Smart accounts enable user experience improvements that were not previously possible with EOA accounts.

Examples include:

* Gasless transactions
* Use of USDC and other ERC-20 tokens for gas fee payments
* Trustless Passkey and FaceID signatures and login
* Account recovery
* Signer rotation
* Multisig and social recovery schemes
* Automated transactions (e.g. for limit orders, deadman switch, auto token revocations, automated DCA investing)
* Transactions with session keys with limited account access
* Batched transactions (e.g. being able to approve and swap in the same transaction)

### When using a bundler without a verifying paymaster, who ends up paying the added fees?

When using the bundler without you sponsoring the gas fees for your users, the users themselves will be the ones covering the gas fees as well as the small bundler overhead for the user operations.

### If the bundler gets exploited, are my ERC-4337 accounts at risk?

No. If the private keys Pimlico uses were to get compromised, that would have no effect on the security of your ERC-4337 accounts. ERC-4337 was designed to make bundlers a completely permissionless entity, meaning in fact that any address could technically be a bundler by calling the `handleOps` function on the EntryPoint contract. Bundler services like Pimlico merely provide a convenient, fast, and reliable way to bundle user operations for you.

The EOA address (if there is one) that controls your ERC-4337 would be controlled by you or a separate service you trust, completely independent of the bundler and Pimlico.


## Alto Bundler

![Landscape](/alto.png)

Alto ⛰️ is a performant, type-safe ERC-4337 bundler written in Typescript.

Our focus is on full type safety, transaction inclusion reliability (even in the case of sudden gas price spikes or chain reorgs), as well as transaction inclusion speed.

### Tutorials

Learning-oriented lessons that take you through a series of steps to complete a project. Most useful when you want to get started with Pimlico. They all involve the Alto Bundler.

* [Tutorial 1](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1) leverages the Alto Bundler to create and bundle a user operation on-chain.
* [Tutorial 2](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-2) leverages the Alto Bundler again, but using the [ERC-20 paymaster](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster) instead of the Verifying Paymaster

### How-To Guides

Step-by-step instructions to accomplish a specific goal. They are useful when you are trying to find out how to do something with Pimlico.

### References

References provide specific technical descriptions. They are most useful when you need detailed information about Pimlico's APIs.


## Self-Host Guide

This guide holds all information related to self hosting your own Alto bundler instance. Including installation, setting up, running, and troubleshooting.

### Installation (Building from source)

To install and build Alto from source, run the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimlicolabs/alto.git
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

And then to start Alto, run

```bash
./alto help
```

### Setup And Prerequisites

Alto manages multiple executor wallets. If any wallet's balance falls below a set minimum, its balance is automatically refilled using funds from the utility wallet. The utility wallet needs to be funded before starting Alto.

EntryPoint V0.7 relies on a simulation contract to be deployed. Alto uses this contract during validation and gas estimations. The simulation contract can be deployed by enabling the `--deploy-simulations-contract` flag.

##### Prerequisites:

* Utility wallet is funded
* Simulations contract is deployed

### Running

Once all the prerequisite conditions are met, Alto can be started using

```bash
./alto run
    --entrypoints "0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032,0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789"
    --entrypoint-simulation-contract "0x74cb5e4ee81b86e70f9045036a1c5477de69ee87"
    --executor-private-keys "0x34e9a7...,0xb08d34...,0x163cbb..."
    --utility-private-keys "0xe768f1..."
    --rpc-url "http://localhost:8545"
    --safe-mode false
```

#### Running Alto using JSON configurations

Alto can also be ran using configurations from a JSON file

Create and setup `alto-config.json`

```
{
    "entrypoints": "0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032,0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789",
    "entrypoint-simulation-contract": "0x74cb5e4ee81b86e70f9045036a1c5477de69ee87",
    "executor-private-keys": "0x34e9a7...,0xb08d34...,0x163cbb...",
    "utility-private-keys": "0xe768f1...",
    "rpc-url": "http://localhost:8545",
    "safe-mode": false
}
```

Run Alto using `alto-config.json` configurations

```bash
./alto run --config "alto-config.json"
```

:::tip[Tip]
It is recommended to run Alto using `safe-mode=false` as it will skip the ERC-7562 reputation checks and DOS prevention. To run alto with `safe-mode=true`, you will need to provide an RPC that has debug\_traceCall enabled.
:::

### compatibility

Some chains have certain compatibility restrictions that require Alto to be ran with special flags.

##### Legacy Transaction Chains

For chains that only support pre EIP-1559 transactions, alto needs to be ran with the flag

```bash
./alto run --legacy-transactions ...
```

##### OP Stack Chains

For chains that are deployed using the OP Stack, alto needs to be ran with the flag

```bash
./alto run --chain-type "op-stack" ...
```

##### Arbitrum Chains

For chains that are deployed using Arbitrum, alto needs to be ran with the flag

```bash
./alto run --chain-type "arbitrum" ...

To effectively integrate Alto, a performant and type-safe ERC-4337 bundler developed by Pimlico, into your CI/CD testing pipeline, we recommend utilizing Prool, a library that provides programmatic HTTP testing instances for Ethereum.rool facilitates the creation of isolated Ethereum environments, enabling efficient testing of smart contracts and related components.
**Installation Steps:**

::::steps
#### Install Anvil

You can find detailed instructions in the [Anvil documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Quickstart:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Source the bashrc file:

:::code-group
```bash [bashrc]
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

```bash [zshrc]
source $HOME/.zshrc
```
:::

Install Foundry:

```bash
foundryup
```

#### Install Prool and Alto:

Use npm to install the Prool and Alto packages:

```bash
npm install @pimlico/alto prool
```

#### Set Up Prool with Anvil:

Prool offers pre-configured instances, including Anvil, which can be used to simulate a local Ethereum execution environment. By using the `fork` option, you can avoid deploying an entry point manually. If you opt for a bare-bones Anvil server, deploying the entry point yourself will be necessary.

```ts
import { createServer } from 'prool';
import { anvil } from 'prool/instances';

const anvilPort = 8545;

const server = createServer({
  instance: anvil({
    port: anvilPort, // The port to run the Anvil server on
    forkUrl: 'https://mainnet.base.org',
    forkBlockNumber: 26008827, // This can be any block number
  }),
});

await server.start();
```

#### Integrate Alto with Prool:

Prool also provides an instance for Alto, enabling seamless integration into your testing environment.

```ts
import { createServer } from 'prool';
import { anvil, alto } from 'prool/instances';
import { entryPoint06Address, entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"

const anvilRpc = `http://localhost:${anvilPort}`
const anvilPrivateKey =
     "0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" // Choose any private key
 const altoPort = 4337

 const altoServer = createServer({
  instance: (key) =>
    alto({
      port: altoPort, // The port to run the Alto server on
      entrypoints: [entryPoint06Address, entryPoint07Address],
      rpcUrl: anvilRpc,
      executorPrivateKeys: [anvilPrivateKey],
    }),
});

await altoServer.start();
```
::::

By following these steps, you can effectively incorporate Alto into your CI/CD testing pipeline using Prool, ensuring a robust and efficient testing environment for your Ethereum applications.


## How to use the bundler

:::tip[Tip]
We recommend using [permissionless.js](/permissionless/reference/smart-account-actions/sendUserOperation) as the SDK to interact with the bundler as it provides type-safe wrappers for all bundler methods.
:::

ERC-4337 bundlers are relayers that bundle user operations into transactions and submit them to the blockchain. You can interact with bundlers using standard JSON-RPC requests.

To get access to the bundler, you need to use your [Pimlico API key](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys). Using the API key, you can make the following JSON-RPC requests to the bundler:

* [eth\_sendUserOperation](/infra/bundler/endpoints/eth_sendUserOperation)
* [eth\_estimateUserOperationGas](/infra/bundler/endpoints/eth_estimateUserOperationGas)
* [eth\_getUserOperationReceipt](/infra/bundler/endpoints/eth_getUserOperationReceipt)
* [eth\_getUserOperationByHash](/infra/bundler/endpoints/eth_getUserOperationByHash)
* [eth\_supportedEntryPoints](/infra/bundler/endpoints/eth_supportedEntryPoints)
* [pimlico\_getUserOperationGasPrice](/infra/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice)
* [pimlico\_getUserOperationStatus](/infra/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationStatus)

If you would like an end-to-end example of how to use the bundler, please refer to [tutorial 1](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1) of the permissionless.js documentation.


## Pimlico Paymasters

Pimlico providers two different types of paymasters to allow you to abstract away the gas fees for your users.

### Verifying Paymaster

Our Verifying Paymaster allows you to load up your off-chain Pimlico balance through [our dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and sponsor the on-chain gas fees for your users on over 100+ chains.

### ERC-20 Paymaster

Our ERC-20 Paymaster is a permissionless on-chain smart contract that lets your users pay for their own gas fees using their ERC-20 tokens.

### FAQ

#### How do we calculate the paymaster surcharge?

Here's a simplified and more fluent version of your text:

When you request paymaster data using `pm_getPaymasterData`, you need to include the user operation with the gas fees value. We sign the gas fees you specify because it’s the bundler’s responsibility to reject user operations that underpay them. Once the transaction is included on-chain, we use the `actualGasCost` based on the details in the `UserOperationEvent`.

Here’s how `entryPoint` determines the `actualGasCost` and calculates the gas price:

```javascript
const gasPrice = min(userop.maxFeePerGas, baseFee + userop.maxPriorityFeePerGas);
const actualGasCost = actualGas * gasPrice;
```

At the end of the month, we add a 10% surcharge to the `actualGasCost` and bill you. The total billed amount is:

```javascript
const billedAmount = actualGasCost * 1.1; // 10% surcharge
```

Why don’t we charge 10% based on what the bundler pays? Because we might not be the bundler—you’re free to use any bundler available. Since the paymaster pays the `gasCost` to the bundler, and there’s no guarantee that we will be the bundler, we must charge the full `actualGasCost` plus the surcharge.


## Supported Chains

Pimlico supports the following chains:

import SupportedChains from "../../../../data/supported-chains.md"
import ChainDetails from "../../../../data/chain-details.md";

<SupportedChains />

All calls are in JSON-RPC format and have to be made to the following URL: `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/{chain}/rpc?apikey=[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]`

Where `{chain}` is the chain variable (such as `sepolia` or `polygon`) as found in the table above.

### Chain Details

Below you can find detailed information about supported entrypoints and account implementations for each chain. For each chain, the table shows which account implementations support which entrypoint versions.

## How to send a userOperation from a EOA using EIP-7702

This guide showcases a simple demo that uses ERC-4337 and EIP-7702 to send a sponsored userOperation from a EOA. We will use Safe as our smart account implementation of choice, but the same applies for any ERC-4337 compatible smart account.

For a high level overview of EIP-7702, checkout our [EIP-7702 conceptual guide](/conceptual/eip7702) and for a more technical overview, please refer to the [EIP-7702 proposal](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702).

### Steps

This guide is divided into two parts. The first part will walk you through how to turn your EOA into a ERC-4337 compatible smart account using EIP-7702. The second part will show you how to send a sponsored userOperation originating from your EOA.

### Part 1: Sending a EIP-7702 set code transaction

::::steps
#### Setup

This demo will be ran on [Odyssey Testnet](https://www.ithaca.xyz/updates/odyssey), which already implements EIP-7702.

To get started, you can bridge funds from Sepolia to Odyssey through [Conduit's SuperBridge](https://odyssey-fba0638ec5f46615.testnets.rollbridge.app/).

You can confirm the bridge transfer by checking the [Odyssey blockchain explorer](https://odyssey-explorer.ithaca.xyz/).

#### Confirming the EOA has no code

Before starting the demo, we can quickly confirm that our EOA has no code attached to it by running the following command:

```bash
cast code $YOUR_EOA_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://odyssey.ithaca.xyz
```

If should return back the following:

```bash
0x
```

#### Signing the Authorization Request

We first need to prepare our EOA by signing a authorization request to set the Safe Singleton contract as our designated delegator. To do this, we extend our wallet client with [Viem's experimental EIP-7702 actions](https://viem.sh/docs/eip7702/).

```ts index.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/1_authorize.ts:authorization]
```

#### Sending the Authorization Request

Before we can interact with our smart account, we also need to initialize it by populating it's storage. With Safe, this is done by calling the `setup` function.

We can make a slight optimization by sending both the Authorization and `setup` call in one transaction which would both set our EOA's code and setup our smart account.

:::info
Note: We are using a separate private key, `safePrivateKey` instead of our EOA's private key to act as our smart account owner. This is because Safe currently doesn't allow the account owner to equal address(this).
:::

:::code-group
```ts [index.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/1_authorize.ts:sendAuthorization]
```

```ts [setupData.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/setupData.ts]
```

```ts [safeAbi.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/safeAbi.ts]
```
:::

:::warning
**Warning**: This demo is meant to serve as a overview of what EIP-7702 and ERC-4337 could look like. This approach should not be used in production as a malicious entity could take over your EOA by frontrunning the setup transaction and setting the **owners** field to an address they control.

#### Confirming the EOA has code

Now that the authorization request has been sent, we can confirm that our EOA has code attached to it by running the following command:

```bash
cast code $YOUR_EOA_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://odyssey.ithaca.xyz
```

If should return back the following:

```bash
0xef010041675c099f32341bf84bfc5382af534df5c7461a
```

Here the EOA's code is in the format of `(0xef0100 ++ address)` where `0xef0100` are magic bytes that indicate the EOA has a active delegation designator. The remaining bytes `0x41675c099f32341bf84bfc5382af534df5c7461a` is the Safe Singleton's address.

### Part 2: Sending the UserOperation

:::steps
#### Preparing the clients

The setup process follows the typical flow of sending a userOperation. The only difference is that when creating the Safe smart account instance, we set the sender address as our EOA's address.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/2_sendUserOperation.ts:prepareClients]
```

#### Sending the UserOperation

We can now send the userOperation as usual.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/2_sendUserOperation.ts:sendUserOperation]
```

#### Review

Congratulations! You have successfully sent a sponsored userOperation from your EOA, if you review the transaction on the blockchain explorer, you will see that the userOperation's sender address is equal to your EOA's address.

### Combined code

If you want to see the complete code that combines all of the previous steps, we uploaded it to a [separate repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/7702-demo). If you're looking to run it, remember to replace the API key with your own!


## Migration Guide

### 0.2.0

:::warning
This migration guide is assuming you have already migrated to ^0.1.0 and are now migrating to 0.2.0.
:::

#### Using viem 2.20.0

Viem released their own version of account abstraction primitives since version `2.18.0`.
Since permissionless.js has viem as a peer dependency and are heavily inspired by viem, we will be updating to use the native account abstraction primitives provided by viem.
For full documentation on viem's account abstraction primitives, please refer to the [viem documentation](https://viem.sh/account-abstraction).

#### Deprecated `createBundlerClient`

Viem has default [createBundlerClient](https://viem.sh/account-abstraction/clients/bundler) so we have deprecated the permissionless.js bundler client.
This means we have also deprecated the following bundler actions:

1. `chainId`
2. `estimateUserOperationGas`
3. `getUserOperationByHash`
4. `getUserOperationReceipt`
5. `sendUserOperation`
6. `supportedEntryPoints`
7. `waitForUserOperationReceipt`

#### Deprecated `getEntryPointVersion`

This is no more needed as all the permissionless versions now accepts entryPoint version explicitly.

#### Deprecated `getUserOperationHash`

This is part of `viem/account-abstraction` and now can be directly imported from `viem`.

#### Deprecated `signUserOperationHashWithECDSA`

#### Deprecated `experimental 7677`

#### Changed `signerToBiconomySmartAccount` to `toBiconomySmartAccount`

```ts
import { toBiconomySmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts"
import { publicClient } from "./publicClient"
import { entryPoint06Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"
import { privateKeyToAccount, generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts"

const biconomyAccount = await signerToBiconomySmartAccount(client { // [!code --]
    signer: privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey()), // [!code --]
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06, // [!code --]
    ...rest
}) // [!code --]
const biconomyAccount = await toBiconomySmartAccount({ // [!code ++]
    client: publicClient, // [!code ++]
    owners: [privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey())],// [!code ++]
    entryPoint: { // [!code ++] 
        address: entryPoint06Address, // [!code ++]
        version: "0.6", // [!code ++]
    } // [!code ++]
    ...rest
})    
```

:::warning
Note, Biconomy's account doesn't work with entryPoint 0.7.
:::

#### Changed `signerToEcdsaKernelSmartAccount` to `toEcdsaKernelSmartAccount`

```ts
import { toEcdsaKernelSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts"
import { publicClient } from "./publicClient"
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"
import { privateKeyToAccount, generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts"

const kernelAccount = await signerToEcdsaKernelSmartAccount(client { // [!code --]
    signer: privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey()), // [!code --]
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06, // [!code --]
    ...rest
}) // [!code --]
const kernelAccount = await toEcdsaKernelSmartAccount({ // [!code ++]
    client: publicClient, // [!code ++]
    owners: [privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey())],// [!code ++]
    entryPoint: { // optional, defaults to 0.7 // [!code ++]
        address: entryPoint07Address, // [!code ++]
        version: "0.7", // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
    ...rest
})    
```

#### Changed `signerToLightSmartAccount` to `toLightSmartAccount`

```ts
import { toLightSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts"
import { publicClient } from "./publicClient"
import { entryPoint06Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"
import { privateKeyToAccount, generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts"

const kernelAccount = await signerToLightSmartAccount(client { // [!code --]
    signer: privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey()), // [!code --]
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06, // [!code --]
    lightAccountVersion: "1.1.0" // [!code --]
    ...rest
}) // [!code --]
const kernelAccount = await toLightSmartAccount({ // [!code ++]
    client: publicClient, // [!code ++]
    owners: [privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey())],// [!code ++]
    entryPoint: { // optional, defaults to 0.7 // [!code ++]

    }, // [!code ++]
    version: "1.1.0" // optional, defaults to "2.0.0" // [!code ++]
    ...rest
})    
```

:::info
We have also added support for `2.0.0` Light Account.
:::

:::warning
The Light Account version `1.1.0` works only with EntryPoint version `0.6` while `2.0.0` works only with EntryPoint version `0.7`.
:::

#### Changed `signerToSafeSmartAccount` to `toSafeSmartAccount`

```ts
import { toSafeSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts"
import { publicClient } from "./publicClient"
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"

const safeAccount = await signerToSafeSmartAccount(client { // [!code --]
    signer: privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey()), // [!code --]
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07, // [!code --]
    safeVersion: "1.4.1" // [!code --]

    }, // [!code ++]
    version: "1.4.1" // [!code ++]
    ...rest
})
```

#### Changed `signerToSimpleSmartAccount` to `toSimpleSmartAccount`

```ts
import { toSimpleSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts"
import { publicClient } from "./publicClient"
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"
import { privateKeyToAccount, generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts"

const simpleAccount = await signerToSimpleSmartAccount(client { // [!code --]
    signer: privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey()), // [!code --]
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06, // [!code --]

    entryPoint: { // optional, defaults to 0.7 // [!code ++]
        address: entryPoint07Address, // [!code ++]
        version: "0.7", // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
    ...rest
})
```

#### Changed `signerToTrustSmartAccount` to `toTrustSmartAccount`

```ts
import { toTrustSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts"
import { publicClient } from "./publicClient"
import { entryPoint06Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"
import { privateKeyToAccount, generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts"

const trustAccount = await signerToTrustSmartAccount(client { // [!code --]
    signer: privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey()), // [!code --]
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06, // [!code --]

    }, // [!code ++]
    ...rest
})
```

:::warning
Note, trust wallet's account doesn't work with entryPoint 0.7.
:::

#### Deprecated \`privateKeyTo\<account-name>SmartAccount

All the private key to account conversion functions are now deprecated. You can use `to<account-name>SmartAccount` to create a smart account instead.

Example:

```ts
import { toSafeSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts"
import { publicClient } from "./publicClient"
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"

const safeAccount = await toSafeSmartAccount({
    client: publicClient,
    owners: [privateKeyToAccount(privateKey)],
    entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7"
    }, // global entrypoint
    version: "1.4.1",
})
```

#### Merged `createPimlicoPaymasterClient` and `createPimlicoBundlerClient` to `createPimlicoClient`

```ts
import { http } from "viem";
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"
import { createPimlicoClient } from "permissionless/clients/pimlico"

const pimlicoUrl = `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=<PIMLICO_API_KEY>`


const pimlicoPaymasterClient = createPimlicoPaymasterClient({ // [!code --]
    chain: foundry, // [!code --]
    transport: http(paymasterRpc), // [!code --]
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07 // [!code --]
}) // [!code --]

const pimlicoPaymasterClient = createPimlicoPaymasterClient({ // [!code --]
    chain: foundry, // [!code --]
    transport: http(paymasterRpc), // [!code --]
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07 // [!code --]
}) // [!code --]

const pimlicoClient = createPimlicoClient({ // [!code ++]
    transport: http(pimlicoUrl), // [!code ++]
    entryPoint: { // Optional, defaults to 0.7 // [!code ++]
        address: entryPoint07Address, // [!code ++]
        version: "0.7", // [!code ++]
    } // [!code ++]
}) // [!code ++]
```

All the previous actions that were part of `createPimlicoBundlerClient` and `createPimlicoPaymasterClient` are now part of `createPimlicoClient` and can also be accessed individually.

Pimlico client also extends actions of Paymaster client by viem. It uses ERC-7677 as the default standard to communicate with Pimlico paymasters.

#### Deprecated `smartAccountClient.deployContract`

#### Changed `smartAccountClient.prepareUserOperationRequest` to `smartAccountClient.prepareUserOperation`

```ts
import { smartAccountClient } from './config'

const userOperation = await smartAccountClient.prepareUserOperationRequest({ // [!code --]
    userOperation: { // [!code --]
        callData: await smartAccountClient.account.encodeCallData({ // [!code --]
            to: CONTRACT_ADDRESS, // [!code --]
            data: "0x", // [!code --]
            value: parseEther('1') // [!code --]
        }), // [!code --]
    } // [!code --]
}) // [!code --]

const userOperation = await smartAccountClient.prepareUserOperation({ // [!code ++]
    calls: [{ // [!code ++]
        to: CONTRACT_ADDRESS, // [!code ++]
        data: "0x", // [!code ++]
        value: parseEther('1') // [!code ++]
    }] // [!code ++]
}) // [!code ++]
```

#### Changed `smartAccountClient.sendUserOperation`

```ts
import { smartAccountClient } from './config'

It also allows you to submit user operations with using `calls` object like with `sendTransaction`. You can read more about it [here](https://viem.sh/account-abstraction/actions/bundler/sendUserOperation).

#### Deprecated `smartAccountClient.sendTransactions`

Use `smartAccountClient.sendTransaction` instead. It now accepts an array of transactions. Read more about it [here](/permissionless/reference/smart-account-actions/sendTransaction#usage).

Example:

```ts
import { account, smartAccountClient } from './config'
import { parseEther } from 'viem'
const hash = await smartAccountClient.sendTransaction({
  account,
  calls: [{ // [!code focus]
    to: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8', // [!code focus]
    value: parseEther('1') // [!code focus]
  }, { // [!code focus]
    abi: wagmiAbi, // [!code focus]
    functionName: 'mint', // [!code focus]
    to: '0xFBA3912Ca04dd458c843e2EE08967fC04f3579c2', // [!code focus]
  }] // [!code focus]
})
```

#### Error handling

We have deprecated permissionless.js error handling and now use viem's error handling.


## How to send multiple user operations in parallel

permissionless.js library lets you to send multiple transactions in parallel. This can be useful if you want to batch multiple calls in a single user operation or if you want to send user operations concurrently.

### Batching Multiple Calls

To batch multiple calls in a single user operation, you can use the `sendTransactions` method.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/parallel-transactions.ts:multiple-transactions]
```

### Sending Multiple User Operations in Parallel

In an Externally Owned Account (EOA), the `nonce` is a simple incrementing number. However, in smart accounts, the `nonce` consists of two components: a `key` and a `sequence`:

* 192-bit “key”
* 64-bit “sequence”

For each unique `key`, the sequence must be incremented by 1 for each transaction. This means that if you send multiple transactions in parallel, you can use different `keys` for the parallel transactions.

#### Parallel Transactions Ordering

Important thing to note is that parallel transaction's ordering is not guaranteed. So execution of random `key` on chain could be:

* \[key-C]\[sequence-0]
* \[key-A]\[sequence-0]
* \[key-B]\[sequence-0]

While execution of `sequence` for a specific `key` will always be in order. So the following is a valid order of execution:

1. \[key-C]\[sequence-0]
2. \[key-A]\[sequence-0]
3. \[key-C]\[sequence-1]
4. \[key-B]\[sequence-0]
5. \[key-A]\[sequence-1]
6. \[key-B]\[sequence-1]

:::info
Note: Pimlico bundler currently only support up to 10 parallel transactions. If you need to send more than 10 transactions in parallel feel free to contact us at [support@pimlico.io](mailto\:support@pimlico.io).
:::

In the example below, we use the current timestamp as the `key` to send parallel transactions. You can use any other value as the `key`.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/parallel-transactions.ts:multiple-transactions-parallel]
```

:::info
Note: The flow described in this section is only applicable to smart accounts that are already deployed, if your account is not deployed, you may run into AA10 errors as multiple userOperations will contain the factory/factoryData fields which will cause conflicts.
:::

This way, you can efficiently manage multiple transactions either sequentially or concurrently.


## permissionless.js

permissionless.js is a TypeScript library built on viem for interacting with ERC-4337 bundlers, paymasters, and User Operations.

### Installation

You can install permissionless.js into your project with the following command:

:::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm install permissionless
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add permissionless
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install permissionless
```

```bash [bun]
bun install permissionless
```

## Tutorials

Learning-oriented lessons that take you through a series of steps to complete a project. Most useful when you want to get started with Pimlico.

[Tutorial 1](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1) takes you through the journey of leveraging permissionless.js's high-level APIs to easily create and bundle a user operation.

[Tutorial 2](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-2) takes you through the journey of sponsoring your first user operation with USDC with an ERC-20 paymaster.


## Tutorial 1 — Send your first gasless transaction

In this tutorial, you will submit your first fully-gasless transaction from a smart account.

You will set up the necessary permissionless.js clients, create a user operation, ask Pimlico's verifying paymaster to sponsor it, and then submit it on-chain with Pimlico's bundler.

### Steps

::::steps
#### Get a Pimlico API key

To get started, please go to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and generate a Pimlico API key.

#### Clone the Pimlico tutorial template repository

We have created a [Pimlico tutorial template repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorial-template) that you can use to get started. It comes set up with Typescript, viem, and permissionless.js.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorial-template.git pimlico-tutorial-1
cd pimlico-tutorial-1
```

Now, let's install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The main file we will be working with is `index.ts`. Let's run it to make sure everything is working:

```bash
npm start
```

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see `Hello world!` printed to the console.

#### Create the public and paymaster clients, and generate a private key

The public client will be responsible for querying the blockchain, while the paymaster client will be responsible for interacting with Pimlico's verifying paymaster endpoint and requesting sponsorship.

Make sure to replace `YOUR_PIMLICO_API_KEY` in the code below with your actual Pimlico API key.

Let's open up `index.ts`, and add the following to the bottom:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-1.ts:clients]
```

#### Create the `SmartAccount` instance

For the purposes of this guide, we will be using [Safe](https://safe.global) accounts. This account is an ERC-4337 wallet controlled by a single EOA signer.

:::tip[Tip]
Want to learn more about using Safe accounts? Take a look at our [dedicated Safe guide](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-safe-account)
:::

To create the Safe account, we will use the `toSafeSmartAccount` utility function from permissionless.js. We need to specify the Safe version we are using as well as the global ERC-4337 EntryPoint address. For the signer, we will be using the previously generated private key.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-1.ts:smartAccount]
```

Let's run this code with `npm start`. You should see the smart account address printed to the console.

```txt
Smart account address: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x374b42bCFAcf85FDCaAB84774EA15ff36D42cdA7
```

:::info
If you visit the address on Etherscan, you might notice that no contract is actually deployed to this address yet. This is because smart account are counterfactual, meaning that they are only deployed on-chain the first time you send a transaction through the account.
:::

#### Create the bundler and smart account clients

Now that we have a `SmartAccount` instance, we need to create a `SmartAccountClient` instance to be able to transact from it. `SmartAccountClient` is an almost drop-in replacement for a viem [`WalletClient`](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet), but it also includes some additional functionality for interacting with smart accounts.

We then specify the optional `sponsorUserOperation` middleware function, calling the `sponsorUserOperation` function from the paymaster client. This will make sure that the user operation is sponsored by Pimlico's verifying paymaster.

Finally, we specify the `gasPrice` middleware function to fetch the gas price from the bundler that we will use to submit the user operation in the next step.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-1.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Submit a transaction from the smart account

Finally, let's submit a transaction from the smart account. We will send a transaction to the `0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045` (vitalik.eth) address with `0x1234` as example `callData`.

Underneath the hood, the `SmartAccountClient` will build a user operation, request Pimlico paymaster sponsorship, sign it with the smart account's private key, and then submit it to the bundler. The bundler will then query for receipts until it sees the user operation included on-chain.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-1.ts:submit]
```

Let's run this code again with `npm start`. You should see the transaction hash bundling the user operation on-chain printed to the console.

```txt
User operation included: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x7a2b61b4b7b6e9e66c459e3c9c24c7a292fc6c740533ce35dbf58710960cc0e5
```

You can now view the transaction on the Sepolia testnet explorer. By sending this user operation, you have:

* Deployed the counterfactual smart account contract
* Had this newly-deployed smart account verify the private key's signature
* Made Pimlico's verifying paymaster sponsor the user operation's gas fees
* Executed a simple transaction to `vitalik.eth`'s address

All in a couple lines of code.

Congratulations, you are now a pioneer of Account Abstraction! 🎉

Please [get in touch](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ) if you have any questions or if you'd like to share what you're building!

#### Combined code

If you want to see the complete code that combines all of the previous steps, we uploaded it to a [separate repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorials). If you're looking to run it, remember to replace the API key with your own!


## Tutorial 2 — Submit a user operation with an ERC-20 Paymaster

:::info
You can visit our [ERC-20 Paymaster overview page](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster) to learn more about the design and architecture of our ERC-20 Paymaster, and the deployed smart contract addresses.
:::

In this tutorial, you will deploy an ERC-4337 smart contract wallet on Base Sepolia, and submit a user operation that pays for its gas fees with USDC using an ERC-20 Paymaster.

### Steps

::::steps
#### Get a Pimlico API key

To get started, please go to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and generate a Pimlico API key.

#### Clone the Pimlico tutorial template repository

We have created a [Pimlico tutorial template repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorial-template) that you can use to get started. It comes set up with Typescript, viem, and permissionless.js.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorial-template.git pimlico-tutorial-2
cd pimlico-tutorial-2
```

Now, let's install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The main file we will be working with is `index.ts`. Let's run it to make sure everything is working:

```bash
npm start
```

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see `Hello world!` printed to the console.

#### Create the public and bundler clients, and generate a private key

The public client will be responsible for querying the blockchain, while the bundler client will be responsible for submitting user operations for relaying.

Make sure to replace `YOUR_PIMLICO_API_KEY` in the code below with your actual Pimlico API key.

Let's open up `index.ts`, and add the following to the bottom:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-2.ts:clients]
```

#### Create the `SmartAccount` instance

For the purposes of this guide, we will be using [Safe](https://safe.global) accounts. This account is an ERC-4337 wallet controlled by a single EOA signer.

:::tip[Tip]
Want to learn more about using Safe accounts? Take a look at our [dedicated Safe guide](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-safe-account)
:::

To create the Safe account, we will use the `toSafeSmartAccount` utility function from permissionless.js.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-2.ts:smartAccount]
```

Since we will be looking to fund our account with USDC (which is what we will use to pay gas fees with), we need to know the address where our smart wallet will be deployed.

Let's run this code with `npm start`. You should see something like this:

```txt
Smart account address: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xbAd38BdCf884ED92ab370f69C0CD0B7b8a1459A1
```

#### Get Testnet USDC on Base Sepolia

Let's get some USDC on the Base Sepolia testnet to the counterfactual address of the wallet we will be deploying. This will be used to pay for the gas fees of the user operation we will be submitting.

The recommended way to do this is to use the [USDC faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/), select 'Base Sepolia' and enter the counterfactual sender address you generated in the previous step.

#### Verify you have USDC on the counterfactual sender address

To make sure you have USDC on the counterfactual sender address, let's add a check to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-2.ts:checkBalance]
```

If you run this code with `npm start`, you should not see any errors, and you should see the USDC balance of the counterfactual sender address printed to the console.

```txt
Smart account USDC balance: 10 USDC
```

#### Send a transaction from the smart account, paying only with USDC for gas fees.

Finally, let's submit a transaction from the smart account. We will send a transaction to the `0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045` (vitalik.eth) address with `0x1234` as example `callData`. We will also specify the gas price we want to use, which we fetched from the bundler in the previous step.

Underneath the hood, the `SmartAccountClient` will build a user operation with the designated ERC-20 Paymaster, sign it with the smart account's private key, and then submit it to the bundler. The bundler will then query for receipts until it sees the user operation included on-chain.

The `paymasterContext` will be passed to the paymaster endpoint, instructing it to sponsor the userOperation using ERC-20 tokens.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-2.ts:submit]
```

Let's run this code again with `npm start`. You should see the transaction hash bundling the user operation on-chain printed to the console.

```txt
User operation included: https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0xf8e4fc41a134fc9530a0c019167f9dc0981874b90187717605355bdcce8b2fb7
```

You can now view the transaction on the Base Sepolia testnet explorer. By sending this user operation, you have:

* Deployed the counterfactual smart account contract
* Had your smart account approve the ERC-20 Paymaster to spend USDC
* Had this newly-deployed smart account verify the private key's signature
* Made an ERC-20 Paymaster sponsor the user operation's gas fees by taking USDC from the smart account
* Executed a simple transaction to `vitalik.eth`'s address

If you visit the address of the `sender` account on the [Base Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.basescan.org), you should also see that some of your USDC balance has been deducted!

That's it! Congratulations!

## Chain is not supported

The chain you are trying to use is not supported by Pimlico.

To see the list of supported chains, take a look at the relevant [bundler](/infra/platform/supported-chains) and [paymaster](/infra/platform/supported-chains) pages.

### Adding new chains

* [Reach out to us](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ) if you would like to see support for a new chain.


## Invalid 'apikey' query parameter

The API key you are trying to use is not valid. It either does not exist or has been deleted.

You can find or generate an API key by going to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io).


## Validation error: Invalid discriminator value

```txt
Validation error: Invalid discriminator value. Expected 'eth_chainId' | 'eth_supportedEntryPoints' | 'eth_coinbase' | 'eth_estimateUserOperationGas' | 'eth_sendUserOperation' | 'eth_getUserOperationByHash' | 'eth_getUserOperationReceipt' | 'pm_supportedEntryPoints' | 'pm_sponsorUserOperation' | 'web3_clientVersion' | 'pimlico_getUserOperationStatus' | 'pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice' | 'pimlico_getBalance' | 'pm_validateSponsorshipPolicies' at \"method\""
```

If you see an error similar to the one above, it means you are calling a method on the Pimlico API that is not supported. The most common reason for this is using the Pimlico API endpoint for standard public Ethereum JSON-RPC methods. As a reminder, the Pimlico API only supports bundler and paymaster methods.

### Possible solutions

Make sure you are using a standard RPC endpoint for public Ethereum methods and the Pimlico API endpoint for Pimlico-specific methods.

```ts
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem"

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
    transport: http("https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=YOUR_PIMLICO_API_KEY") // [!code --]
    transport: http("https://sepolia.rpc.thirdweb.com") // [!code ++]
})
```


## Unknown error from alto bundler

The bundler encountered an unexpected error. This is either an internal 500 error, or an error with sensitive information that can not returned.

### Possible solutions

* [Reach out to us](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ) if you see this error.


## eth\_estimateUserOperationGas

This method simulates the user operation and estimates the appropriate gas limits for it. If the operation is not successful, it will return an error.

:::tip[Tip]
This method will *not* revert if the `signature` field in the user operation fails. However, most account implementations require the signature to be well formed, which usually means it must have the correct length.

For SimpleAccount, you can use the following dummy signature to put in the `signature` field during gas estimation:

```txt
0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff0000000000000000000000000000000007aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1c
```
:::

### EntryPoint v0.7

:::warning[Warning]
The EntryPoint v0.7 API expects an `UnpackedUserOperation` instead of a `PackedUserOperation`.
According to the spec it is bundler's responsibility to pack the userOp before sending it to the EntryPoint.
So make sure to send an `UnpackedUserOperation` to the bundler.
:::

:::tip[Tip]
If the UserOperation's callData fails during estimation, the bundler will return the revert reason.
:::

:::tip[Tip]
Estimations are done with a balance override on the UserOperation's sender, this allows you to estimate the gas cost even if the sender has no funds. However, if the userOperation is sent onchain when the sender has no balance, it will revert during the callphase due to out of funds.
:::

   * **eip7702Auth** - `SignedAuthorization`: (Optional) The EIP-7702 authorization data. This can be a dummy authorization for estimations.

2. **entryPoint** - `Address`: The entry point contract address.

##### SignedAuthorization Type

```typescript
{
    address: Address,      // addressSchema - The contract address for the authorization
    chainId: Hex,                  // hexNumberSchema transformed to Hex - The chain ID
    nonce: Hex,                    // hexNumberSchema transformed to Hex - The nonce
    r: Hex,                        // hexData32Schema transformed to Hex - The r component of the signature
    s: Hex,                        // hexData32Schema transformed to Hex - The s component of the signature
    v: HexString,                  // hexNumberSchema - The v component of the signature
    yParity: HexNumber             // hexNumberSchema transformed to Hex - The y-parity value
}
```

### Using state overrides

You can use state overrides to simulate the user operation with a different state the same way you would with [`eth_call`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-eth#eth-call) by including an optional third parameter. This is supported for both EntryPoint v0.6 and v0.7.

## eth\_sendUserOperation

Submits a user operation to be included on-chain and returns the `userOpHash` if successful (or queued). If the operation is not successful, it will return an error.

### EntryPoint v0.7

:::warning[Warning]
The EntryPoint v0.7 API expects an `UnpackedUserOperation` instead of a `PackedUserOperation`.
According to the spec it is bundler's responsibility to pack the userOp before sending it to the EntryPoint.
So make sure to send an `UnpackedUserOperation` to the bundler.
:::

:::warning[Warning]
For entryPoint v0.7, we will not be reverting if the execution of the `callData` field in the user operation fails.
We revert only when you are calling `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`.

## pimlico\_getUserOperationStatus

This method takes in a user operation hash and returns the status of the operation and, optionally, the transaction hash the bundler is using to bundle the user operation on-chain. The status can be one of the following:

| result          | response includes transaction hash | description                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `not_found`     | false                              | the operation hash is not known to the bundler or has been rejected during validation and has never entered the mempool                              |
| `not_submitted` | false                              | the operation hash is known to the bundler but is sitting in the mempool and has not been bundled into a transaction yet                             |
| `submitted`     | true                               | the operation hash is known to the bundler, has been bundled into a transaction which is currently pending in the mempool                            |
| `rejected`      | false                              | the operation hash has entered the mempool but as it was being bundled into a bundle transaction the re-simulation failed and it was never submitted |
| `included`      | true                               | the operation hash is known to the bundler and has been included on-chain                                                                            |
| `failed`        | true                               | the operation hash is known to the bundler and the transaction bundling it has been included on-chain but the bundle transaction reverted            |
| `queued`        | false                              | the operation hash is known to the bundler but is waiting in a queue before being sent to the mempool due to its nonce being too high                |

:::info
Note: the transaction hash returned when the result is `submitted` can change if the bundler resubmits the user operation inside a different transaction. For this reason, when showing the pending transaction hash to the user, it is recommended to keep calling this method in case the transaction hash changes.

Metadata fields are included when available based on token type:

* For ERC-20 tokens: `name`, `symbol`
* For ERC-721 tokens: `name`, `symbol`
* For ERC-1155 tokens: `name`, `symbol`

These fields will be included when they can be found, otherwise they'll be undefined. This is because metadata is optional in ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 standards, though most tokens do support these fields.

### Error Responses

| Error Code            | Description                                       |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| AA23                  | UserOperation reverted during simulation          |
| UserOperationReverted | User operation execution failed during simulation |
| SimulateValidation    | Validation failed for the user operation          |


## AA10 sender already constructed

The sender (i.e. the smart account) has already been created previously. You may be trying to create the account multiple times.

### Possible solutions

* Remove the `initCode` from the user operation.

```ts
const userOperationHash = await bundlerClient.sendUserOperation({
    initCode: "0xaee9762ce625e0a8f7b184670fb57c37bfe5e0a8f7...", // [!code --]
    initCode: "0x", // [!code ++]
    ..., // the rest of the user operation
})
```


## AA13 initCode failed or OOG

:::info
OOG = Out Of Gas
:::

The EntryPoint failed to create the smart account with the `initCode` provided. There are two possible reasons:

* The `initCode` ran out of gas
* The `initCode` reverted during the account deployment process

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the factory address in the `initCode` is correct (the factory address is the first 20 bytes of the `initCode`).
* Verify that the `initCode` is correct.
* Check whether the `verificationGasLimit` is sufficient for the `initCode` to complete without running out of gas.
* If the root cause is a revert, investigate why the `initCode` reverts during the account deployment process using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA14 initCode must return sender

The address of the smart account deployed with the `initCode` provided does not match match the `sender` address provided in the user operation.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the `sender` address was generated deterministically from the `initCode`. (consider leveraging functions like [getSenderAddress](/permissionless/reference/public-actions/getSenderAddress))
* Verify that the factory address in the `initCode` is correct (the factory address is the first 20 bytes of the `initCode`).
* Verify that the `initCode` is correct.
* If all else fails, investigate why the `initCode` deploys to a different address than expected using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA15 initCode must create sender

The smart account deployment process with the `initCode` does not return any `sender` address. There are two possible reasons:

* The `initCode` factory is not creating an account.
* The `initCode` factory is creating an account, but is not implemented correctly as it is not returning the deployed `sender` address.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the factory address in the `initCode` is correct (the factory address is the first 20 bytes of the `initCode`).
* Verify that the `initCode` factory is implemented correctly. The factory must deploy the smart account and return the deployed `sender` address.
* If all else fails, investigate why the `initCode` factory does not return a `sender` address using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA20 account not deployed

An `initCode` was not specified, but the `sender` address (i.e. the smart account) is not deployed.

### Possible solutions

* If this is the first transaction by this account, make sure the `initCode` is included in the user operation.
* If the smart account is already supposed to be deployed, verify that you have selected the correct `sender` address for the user operation.


## AA21 didn't pay prefund

You are *not* using a paymaster, but the `sender` address did not have enough native tokens to cover the gas costs associated with the user operation.

### Possible solutions

* If you are *not* using a paymaster, verify that the `sender` address has enough native tokens to cover the required prefund. Consider leveraging functions like [`getRequiredPrefund`](/permissionless/reference/utils/getRequiredPrefund).

```ts
const requiredPrefund = getRequiredPrefund({
    userOperation
})

const senderBalance = await publicClient.getBalance({
    address: userOperation.sender
})

if (senderBalance < requiredPrefund) {
    throw new Error(`Sender address does not have enough native tokens`)
}
```

* If you are looking to use a paymaster to cover the gas fees, verify that the `paymasterAndData` field is set.

```ts
const userOperationHash = await bundlerClient.sendUserOperation({
    paymasterAndData: "0x3b912be0270b59143985cc5c6aab452d99e2b4bb0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064c0957400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007d99385d8ef0af67affbf9944df8c121e9d1f6aef8dd82a4aeb5db310c42d3dc5b51c9e0835d94c3b22564d3d94f0e1d14e37571e46651da8de567d128a361a01b", // [!code ++]
    ..., // the rest of the user operation
})
```


## AA22 expired or not due

The `signature` used in the user operation is not valid, because it is outside of the time range it specified.

The smart account's `validateUserOp` function returns `validationData`, a `bytes32` field. This field is a concatenation of the `validAfter`, `validUntil`, and `aggregator` fields.

This error occurs when the `block.timestamp` falls after the `validUntil` timestamp, or before the `validAfter` timestamp.

### Possible solutions

* If you are looking to use time-based signatures, verify that the `validAfter` and `validUntil` fields are set correctly and that the user operation is sent within the specified range.
* If you are *not* looking to use time-based signatures, verify that the `validAfter` and `validUntil` fields are set to `0`.

:::tip[Tip]
If you are not looking to use neither time-based signatures nor a signature aggregator, it is recommended to simply return `uint(0)` for valid signatures and `uint(1)` for invalid signatures in the smart account's `validateUserOp` function.
:::


## AA23 reverted (or OOG)

:::info
OOG = Out Of Gas
:::

The `validateUserOp` function of the smart account either reverted or ran out of gas.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the `verificationGasLimit` is high enough to cover the `validateUserOp` function's gas costs.
* Verify that the `validateUserOp` function is implemented with the correct logic, and that the user operation is supposed to be valid.
* If you are *not* using a paymaster, verify that the `sender` address has enough native tokens to cover the required prefund. Consider leveraging functions like [`getRequiredPrefund`](/permissionless/reference/utils/getRequiredPrefund).

```ts
const requiredPrefund = getRequiredPrefund({
    userOperation
})

const senderBalance = await publicClient.getBalance({
    address: userOperation.sender
})

if (senderBalance < requiredPrefund) {
    throw new Error(`Sender address does not have enough native tokens`)
}
```

* If you *are* looking to use a paymaster to cover the gas fees, verify that the `paymasterAndData` field is set.

```ts
const userOperationHash = await bundlerClient.sendUserOperation({
    paymasterAndData: "0x3b912be0270b59143985cc5c6aab452d99e2b4bb0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064c0957400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007d99385d8ef0af67affbf9944df8c121e9d1f6aef8dd82a4aeb5db310c42d3dc5b51c9e0835d94c3b22564d3d94f0e1d14e37571e46651da8de567d128a361a01b", // [!code ++]
    ..., // the rest of the user operation
})
```

* Make sure the signature verification logic of the smart account is implemented correctly. Namely, correct implementations should **not** revert when the signature is invalid. If you are not looking to use neither time-based signatures nor a signature aggregator, you should simply return `uint(1)` for invalid signatures in the `validateUserOp` function.
* If all else fails, investigate why the `validateUserOp` function reverted using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA24 signature error

The `validateUserOp` function of the smart account rejected the signature of the user operation.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the user operation was correctly signed, and that the signature was correctly encoded in the `signature` field of the user operation.
  * Most smart account implementations sign over the `userOpHash`. Make sure that the `userOpHash` is correctly computed. Consider leveraging functions like `getUserOperationHash` from `viem/account-abstraction`.
  * Make sure you have selected the correct `chainId` and `entryPointAddress` when computing the `userOpHash`.
  * Make sure the smart account signature verification function is correctly implemented.
* If all else fails, investigate why the `validateUserOp` function rejected the user operation signature using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA25 invalid account nonce

The `nonce` of the user operation is invalid.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that you are using the correct `nonce` for the user operation. The `nonce` should be the current nonce of the smart account for the selected `key`. Consider leveraging functions like [`getAccountNonce`](/permissionless/reference/public-actions/getAccountNonce).
  * Make sure that you are not reusing a nonce that has already been used.
  * Make sure that you are not using a nonce that is too far in the future (more than 10 higher than the current nonce).
* Verify that the nonce is formatted correctly.
* Use custom nonce `key` to send parallel transactions. See [How to Send Multiple Transactions](/permissionless/how-to/parallel-transactions##sending-multiple-transactions-in-parallel).

:::info
Instead of sequential nonce the EntryPoint implements a nonce mechanism that uses a single `uint256` nonce value in the user operation, but treats it as two values:

* 192-bit `key`
* 64-bit `sequence`

For each `key` the `sequence` is validated and incremented sequentially and monotonically by the EntryPoint for each user operation, however a new `key` can be introduced with an arbitrary value at any point.
:::


## AA30 paymaster not deployed

:::info
The first 20 bytes of the `paymasterAndData` field specify the address of the paymaster contract you are requesting to use.
:::

The paymaster contract is not deployed.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the `paymasterAndData` field is correct, and that the first 20 bytes are the address of the paymaster contract you intend to use.
* Verify that the paymaster contract is deployed on the network you are using.


## AA31 paymaster deposit too low

:::info
The first 20 bytes of the `paymasterAndData` field specify the address of the paymaster contract you are requesting to use.
:::

The paymaster contract does not have enough funds deposited into the EntryPoint contract to cover the required prefund of the user operation.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the `paymasterAndData` field is correct, and that the first 20 bytes are the address of the paymaster contract you intend to use.
* If you are using your own paymaster contract, deposit more funds into the EntryPoint contract through the `deposit()` function of the paymaster contract.
* If you are using a paymaster service like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).


## AA32 expired or not due

:::info
By default, signatures from Pimlico's verifying paymaster are only valid for 10 minutes.
:::

The paymaster's signature used in the `paymasterAndData` field of the user operation is not valid, because it is outside of the time range it specified.

The paymaster's `validatePaymasterUserOp` function returns `validationData`, a `bytes32` field. This field is a concatenation of the `validAfter`, `validUntil`, and `aggregator` fields.

This error occurs when the `block.timestamp` falls after the `validUntil` timestamp, or before the `validAfter` timestamp.

### Possible solutions

* If you are using your own paymaster contract and using time-based signatures, verify that the `validAfter` and `validUntil` fields are set correctly and that the user operation is sent within the specified range.
* If you are using your own paymaster contract and *not* looking to use time-based signatures, verify that the `validAfter` and `validUntil` fields are set to `0`.
* If you are using Pimlico's verifying paymaster service to fetch the `paymasterAndData` field, make sure you are sending the user operation within 10 minutes of receiving the paymaster signature. If you would like a longer validity period, [please contact us](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).


## AA33 reverted (or OOG)

:::info
OOG = Out Of Gas
:::

The `validatePaymasterUserOp` function of the paymaster contract either reverted or ran out of gas.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the `verificationGasLimit` is high enough to cover the `validatePaymasterUserOp` function's gas costs.
* If you are using your own paymaster contract, verify that the `validatePaymasterUserOp` function is implemented with the correct logic, and that the user operation is supposed to be valid.
* If you are using your own paymaster contract, make sure the signature verification logic of the paymaster is implemented correctly. Namely, correct implementations should **not** revert when the paymaster signature is invalid. If you are not looking to use neither time-based signatures, you should simply return `uint(1)` for invalid signatures in the `validatePaymasterUserOp` function.
* If you are using a paymaster service like Pimlico, and the user operation is well formed with a high enough `verificationGasLimit`, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
* If you are *not* looking to use a paymaster to cover the gas fees, verify that the `paymasterAndData` field is not set.

```ts
const userOperationHash = await bundlerClient.sendUserOperation({
    paymasterAndData: "0x3b912be0270b59143985cc5c6aab452d99e2b4bb0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064c0957400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007d99385d8ef0af67affbf9944df8c121e9d1f6aef8dd82a4aeb5db310c42d3dc5b51c9e0835d94c3b22564d3d94f0e1d14e37571e46651da8de567d128a361a01b", // [!code --]
    paymasterAndData: "0x", // [!code ++]
    ..., // the rest of the user operation
})
```

* If all else fails, investigate why the `validatePaymasterUserOp` function reverted using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA34 signature error

:::info
The first 20 bytes of the `paymasterAndData` field specify the address of the paymaster contract you are requesting to use.
:::

The `validatePaymasterUserOp` function of the paymaster contract rejected the signature of the user operation.

### Possible solutions

* If you are using your own paymaster contract, verify that the user operation was correctly signed according to your implementation, and that the paymaster signature was correctly encoded in the `paymasterAndData` field of the user operation.
  * Most paymaster implementations sign over a custom hash of the user operation. Make sure that the hash is correctly computed.
  * Make sure the paymaster signature verification function is correctly implemented.
* If you are using a paymaster service like Pimlico, make sure you do not modify any of the fields of the user operation after the paymaster signs over it (except the `signature` field).
* If you are using a paymaster service like Pimlico and you have not modified any of the fields except the `signature` but you are still getting this error, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
* If all else fails, investigate why the `validatePaymasterUserOp` function rejected the paymaster signature using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA40 over verificationGasLimit

The amount of gas used by the smart account and paymaster verification exceeded the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation is high enough to cover the gas used during smart account and paymaster verification.
* If you are using the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` or `pm_sponsorUserOperation` method from bundler provider like Pimlico to set user operation gas limits and the EntryPoint throws this error during submission, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
* If all else fails, investigate why the smart account and/or paymaster used more gas than expected using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA41 too little verificationGas

The amount of gas used by the smart account verification exceeded the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation is high enough to cover the gas used during smart account's `validateUserOp` function.
* If you are using the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` or `pm_sponsorUserOperation` method from bundler provider like Pimlico to set user operation gas limits and the EntryPoint throws this error during submission, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
* If all else fails, investigate why the smart account's `validateUserOp` function used more gas than expected using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA50 postOp reverted

:::info
`postOp` is a function that is called by the EntryPoint on the paymaster contract after the user operation execution is completed. It is often used by paymasters to perform additional accounting logic.
:::

The paymaster contract's `postOp` function reverted.

### Possible solutions

* If you are using your own paymaster contract, verify that that you have correctly implemented the `postOp` function (if you are using one). If you do *not* intent to make use of the `postOp` function, make sure you do not set the `context` parameter in the paymaster's `validatePaymasterUserOp` function.
* If you are using a paymaster service like Pimlico and you see this error, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
* If all else fails, investigate why the `postOp` function reverted using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA51 prefund below actualGasCost

The actual gas cost of the user operation ended up being higher than the prefund paid by the smart account or the paymaster.

### Possible solutions

* If you encounter this error, try increasing the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation.
* If you are using the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` or `pm_sponsorUserOperation` method from bundler provider like Pimlico to set user operation gas limits and the EntryPoint throws this error during submission, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
* If all else fails, investigate why the actual gas cost ended up being higher than the prefund paid using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).


## AA90 invalid beneficiary

The bundler did not set a beneficiary address when bundling the user operation.

### Possible solutions

* If you encounter this error when running self-hosted bundler, make sure you have configured the bundler correctly.
* If you are using a bundler provider like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).


## AA91 failed send to beneficiary

The EntryPoint's transfer to the beneficiary of the funds accrued from the user operation reverted.

### Possible solutions

* If you encounter this error when running self-hosted bundler, make sure you have configured the bundler correctly.
* If you are using a bundler provider like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).


## AA92 internal call only

The bundler attempted to call `innerHandleOp` function of the EntryPoint directly as opposed to through the `handleOps` function.

### Possible solutions

* If you encounter this error when running self-hosted bundler, make sure you have configured the bundler correctly.
* If you are using a bundler provider like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).


## AA93 invalid paymasterAndData

:::info
The first 20 bytes of the `paymasterAndData` field specify the address of the paymaster contract you are requesting to use.
:::

The `paymasterAndData` field is of an incorrect length.

### Possible solutions

* Make sure you have either not set a value for the `paymasterAndData`, or that it is at least 20 bytes long.
* If you are using a paymaster provider like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).


## AA94 gas values overflow

One or more of the gas values of the user operation do not fit into a `uint160`.

### Possible solutions

* Verify that all the gas limit and gas price fields in your user operation fit into `uint160`.
* If the gas limits or gas prices for your user operation causing this error are suggested by a bundler provider like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).


## AA95 out of gas

The bundler tried to bundle the user operation with the gas limit set too low.

### Possible solutions

* If you are using a bundler provider like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).


## AA96 invalid aggregator

The bundler tried to bundle aggregated user operations with an invalid aggregator.

## ERC-20 Paymaster Architecture

:::info
You can view the whole ERC-20 Paymaster contract [in our repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs).

This paymaster is an onchain contract, we can not guarantee that using the paymaster is risk-free. Please use the paymaster at your own risk.
:::

### Design

Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster is an ERC-4337 Paymaster that relies on an offchain API, powered by Pimlico, to supply the user with an up-to-date token price, alongside a signature from a valid signer address. The paymaster is able to pay for the gas fees of your users in exchange for ERC-20 tokens that are drawn from the user.

### Estimating the amount of tokens required for a user operation

After calling the `pimlico_getTokenQuotes` function, the Pimlico API will return two important values, `exchangeRate` and `postOpGas`. You can use these two values, alongside information about the user operation you're looking to sponsor, to get an estimate of the amount of tokens required for the user operation.

You can do this by using [this onchain function](https://github.com/pimlicolabs) on the paymaster.


## ERC-20 Paymaster Contract Addresses

Below are the contract addresses for the ERC-20 Paymaster contracts that are currently deployed.

Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster is deployed at the following addresses:

| EntryPoint Version | Paymaster Contract Address                 |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| v0.6               | 0x6666666666667849c56f2850848ce1c4da65c68b |
| v0.7               | 0x777777777777AeC03fd955926DbF81597e66834C |
| v0.8               | 0x888888888888Ec68A58AB8094Cc1AD20Ba3D2402 |

All currently deployed paymasters have the same contract address on all chains, but this might not remain the case in the future.

## ERC-20 Paymaster FAQs

### What is a paymaster?

A Paymaster is a special smart contract under the [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) specification that user operations are able to delegate the responsibility of gas fee payments to. This means that ERC-4337 smart contract wallets no longer need to necessarily be responsible for directly paying gas fees in ETH. The paymaster contracts are able to use custom logic (with certain limitations) to decide whether or not they are willing to sponsor a user operation.

### What is an ERC-20 Paymaster?

An ERC-20 Paymaster is a specific type of paymaster that is willing to sponsor the gas fees for a user operation if and only if the smart contract wallet pays the paymaster for it in an ERC-20 token like USDC, DAI, etc. In effect, this allows smart contract wallets to pay for gas fees purely in ERC-20 tokens and means, if designed correctly, they never need to hold any native tokens like ETH.

### How do I use Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster?

We wrote a [tutorial](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-2) that takes you through the whole flow of deploying a Safe account and sending your first user operation sponsored with USDC.

We also have a [how-to guide](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/how-to/use-paymaster) that explains how to use the ERC-20 Paymaster in your app's flow.

:::steps
### What is the contract address of the ERC-20 Paymaster?

The currently supported tokens are listed [here](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/contract-addresses).

Theoretically, we can support any token on any EVM chains that have Chainlink interface compatible oracle support. If you have a token that you would like supported, please [reach out to us](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ)!

### Where can I find the ERC-20 Paymaster contract?

You can find the contract source code [here](https://github.com/pimlicolabs).

### How can I use a token that is not currently supported by Pimlico?

Please get in touch with us. For enterprise customers we will do what we can to see if we can add support for the token you are interested in.

### Does Pimlico take a fee?

Yes, the owner takes a fee that is baked into the `exchangeRate` returned by the API. This markup serves to compensate the onwer for maintaining the infrastructure and covering risks associated with price fluctuations and slippage risk.

:::

## Design

The most important design decision for Pimlico's ERC20Paymaster was permissionlessness — you do not have to interact with any hosted APIs to leverage the paymaster. This has the tradeoff however that token approvals to the paymaster cannot be done during the execution phrase of the UserOperation, and must rather be done during the validation phase or in a previous UserOperation. We felt like this was a good tradeoff to make, because token approvals should only be a one-time friction for users under normal circumstances.

It is important to note that while Pimlico's paymaster is permissionless, it is not decentralized. The owner of the paymaster is able to do a couple very limited actions. These are further explained in the Admin functions section of this page. It was however designed so it can easily be made decentralized in the future.

### Oracle

The ERC20 paymaster leverages Chainlink for its price oracles, and uses a combination of the ERC20 Token to USD and Native Token to USD prices to calculate the ERC-20 Token to Native Token price. This means that the paymaster is easily deployable on any chain for any token that has Chainlink support, but it also means that if Chainlink is compromised, the price can be arbitrarily different from the real token price for the end user.

### Paymaster-specific functions

Paymasters under the [ERC-4337 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) must implement two functions.

`validatePaymasterUserOp` allows the paymaster to verify whether the paymaster is willing to pay for the User Operation with custom logic. The paymaster is restricted during this phrase in what it can do. Most importantly, it must comply with the banned opcode and banned external storage access rules of the ERC. For this reason, actions like fetching oracle price state are not possible as they access external storage that is not associated with the account.

`postOp` is called by the EntryPoint on the paymaster after making the main execution call if any `context` is returned by the `validatePaymasterUserOp` function. Since our paymaster always returns context, this will always be called.

### Paymaster Modes

This paymaster has four modes. It allows the user to simply pay for themselves, but also allows the selection of a guarnator who can front the ERC-20 token fees during validation, allowing the user to approve tokens to the paymaster or fetch / claim tokens if they do not already have any. For each mode, it is possible to set a ERC-20 token spend limit to protect against sudden price fluctuations or oracle manipulation.

#### Mode 0

* The user (sender) pays for gas fees with the ERC-20 token.
* paymasterData is empty

#### Mode 1

* The user (sender) pays for gas fees with the ERC-20 token,
* There is a limit to the amount of ERC-20 tokens that can be taken from the user for the user opertion.
* paymasterData: "0x01" + token spend limit (32 bytes)

#### Mode 2

* A guarantor fronts the ERC-20 token gas fees during validation, and expects the user to be able to pay the actual cost during the postOp phase and get refunded. Otherwise the guarantor is liable.
* paymasterData: "0x02" + guarantor address (20 bytes) + validUntil (6 bytes) + validAfter (6 bytes) + guarantor signature (dynamic bytes)

#### Mode 3

* A guarantor fronts the ERC-20 token gas fees during validation, and expects the user to be able to pay the actual cost during the postOp phase and get refunded. Otherwise the guarantor is liable.
* There is a limit to the amount of ERC-20 tokens that can be taken from the user/guarantor for the user opertion.
* paymasterData: "0x03" + token spend limit (32 bytes) + guarantor address (20 bytes) + validUntil (6 bytes) + validAfter (6 bytes) + guarantor signature (dynamic bytes)

### Creating a valid guarantor signature

The guarantor address can either be a EOA or Smart Contract.

* If EOA, verification is done through ECDSA signature recovery.
* If Smart Contract, verification is done through ERC-1271.

#### EOA Guarantor Signature

The paymaster validates a userOperation by checking if the guarantor signed the associated hash generated by the userOperation, validUntil, validAfter, and tokenLimit.

:::info
**Note:** The `signMessage` method in both Viem and Ethers.js uses the EIP-191 format, which adds extra metadata to the message before signing. This makes the resulting signature incompatible with the paymaster, as it expects a signature of the raw message hash without any additional data.

    [pad(r), pad(s), Number(v)]
)

// creating paymaster and data for a Mode2 sponsor
const mode2PaymasterData = encodePacked(
    ["bytes1", "address", "bytes6", "bytes6", "bytes"],
    [
        "0x02",
        privateKeyToAddress(guarantorPrivateKey),
        toHex(validUntil, { size: 6 }),
        toHex(validAfter, { size: 6 }),
        signature,
    ],
)

// append paymaster data to userOperation
const sponsoredUserOperation = {
    ...userOperation
    paymaster: erc20Paymaster.address,
    paymasterData: mode2PaymasterData,
}
```

You can also set completely custom client-side logic to select the paymaster to use. This can be useful if you want to use multiple paymasters in different scenarios.

```ts [erc20Paymaster.ts]
import { getContract, createPublicClient } from "viem"
import { ERC20_PAYMASTER_ABI } from "./abi.ts"

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
    transport: http("https://sepolia.rpc.thirdweb.com"),
})

export const erc20Paymaster = getContract({
    abi: ERC20_PAYMASTER_ABI,
    address: "0x000000000041F3aFe8892B48D88b6862efe0ec8d",

#### Smart Contract Guarantor Signature

ERC-1271 is a standard way to verify a signature when the account is a smart contract. The smart contract needs to implement the following interface to be compatible. More details can be found in the [original ERC](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271).

```solidity [IERC1271.sol]
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC-1271 standard signature validation method for
 * contracts as defined in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271.
 */
interface IERC1271 {
    /**
     * @dev Checks whether the signature is valid for the provided data
     * @param hash      Hash of the data to be signed

## ERC-20 Paymaster Contract Addresses

Below are the contract addresses for the ERC-20 Paymaster contracts that are currently deployed. Keep in mind that in additional to the below, our ERC-20 Paymasters can support any ERC-20 tokens that have a Chainlink interface compatible oracle. To see if this is the case, verify that there exists a YOUR\_TOKEN / USD price feed on the [Chainlink Price Feeds page](https://data.chain.link/feeds?categories=Crypto). If so, [contact us](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ) and we can deploy our ERC-20 Paymaster contracts for your token.

## ERC-20 Paymaster FAQs

### What is a paymaster?

A Paymaster is a special smart contract under the [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) specification that user operations are able to delegate the responsibility of gas fee payments to. This means that ERC-4337 smart contract wallets no longer need to necessarily be responsible for directly paying gas fees in ETH. The paymaster contracts are able to use custom logic (with certain limitations) to decide whether or not they are willing to sponsor a UserOperation.

### What is an ERC-20 Paymaster?

An ERC-20 Paymaster is a specific type of paymaster that is willing to sponsor the gas fees for a UserOperation if and only if the smart contract wallet pays the paymaster for it in an ERC-20 token like USDC, DAI, etc. In effect, this allows smart contract wallets to pay for gas fees purely in ERC-20 tokens and means, if designed correctly, they never need to hold any native tokens like ETH.

### What are the four modes of the ERC-20 Paymaster?

This paymaster has four modes. It allows the user to be simply made to pay themselves, but also allows the selection of a guarnator who can front the ERC-20 token fees during validation, allowing the user to approve tokens to the paymaster or fetch / claim tokens if they do not already have any. For each mode, it is possible to set a ERC-20 token spend limit to protect against sudden price fluctuations or oracle manipulation.

#### Mode 0

* The user (sender) pays for gas fees with the ERC-20 token.
* paymasterData is empty

#### Mode 1

* The user (sender) pays for gas fees with the ERC-20 token,
* There is a limit to the amount of ERC-20 tokens that can be taken from the user for the user opertion.
* paymasterData: "0x01" + token spend limit (32 bytes)

#### Mode 2

* A guarantor fronts the ERC-20 token gas fees during validation, and expects the user to be able to pay the actual cost during the postOp phase and get refunded. Otherwise the guarantor is liable.
* paymasterData: "0x02" + guarantor address (20 bytes) + validUntil (6 bytes) + validAfter (6 bytes) + guarantor signature (dynamic bytes)

#### Mode 3

* A guarantor fronts the ERC-20 token gas fees during validation, and expects the user to be able to pay the actual cost during the postOp phase and get refunded. Otherwise the guarantor is liable.
* There is a limit to the amount of ERC-20 tokens that can be taken from the user/guarantor for the user opertion.
* paymasterData: "0x03" + token spend limit (32 bytes) + guarantor address (20 bytes) + validUntil (6 bytes) + validAfter (6 bytes) + guarantor signature (dynamic bytes)

### How do I use Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster?

:::info
**Check out our tutorial!** We wrote a [tutorial](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-2) that takes you through the whole flow of deploying a Safe account and sending your first user operation sponsored with USDC.
:::

While the specifics can vary depending on the specific ERC-20 token and chain you're using, the general steps are as follows:

:::steps
#### Find the appropriate ERC-20 Paymaster address for the token and chain you're using.

You can do this either by going to our [ERC-20 Paymaster Contracts](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/contract-addresses) reference page or

#### Approve ERC-20 tokens to the ERC-20 Paymaster so it can spent it on your behalf

Call the `approve` function on the ERC-20 token you wish to use, specifying the corresponding ERC-20 paymaster as the contract you are approving the tokens to.

#### Generate the paymasterData to place in your user operation

The `paymaster` field is just the ERC-20 paymaster address, but the `paymsterData` for the ERC-20 Paymaster can look in one of four ways depending on which paymaster mode you use.

#### Submit the user operation

Do any final touches to your user operation, such as signing, then submit the user operation to a bundler [like ours](/infra/bundler/usage) and watch it be included on-chain!
:::

### Is there a walkthrough I can use to see how to interact with the paymaster?

Yes!

Check out our [Getting Started with the ERC-20 Paymaster](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-2) guide that walks you through deploying your SimpleWallet and getting your first UserOperation sponsored with USDC.

### What ERC-20 tokens and on what chains can I use Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster with?

The currently supported tokens are listed [here](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/contract-addresses).

Theoretically, we can support any token on any EVM chains that have Chainlink interface compatible oracle support. If you have a token that you would like supported, please [reach out to us](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ)!

### Where can I find the ERC-20 Paymaster contract?

You can find the contract source code [here](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/erc20-paymaster/blob/0b3375c9ea6436b12c752146060ab785082f0734/src/ERC20Paymaster.sol).

### Does the ERC-20 Paymaster use an admin upgradeable proxy?

No, we do not. The contracts we deploy can never be upgraded. However there is only one variable that can be changed by the owner: the `priceMarkup`.

### Has Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster been audited?

Yes, the ERC-20 Paymaster contract by Pimlico has been audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/). The full audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/erc20-paymaster/blob/main/audits/2024-03-openzeppelin.pdf).

However, an audit does not guarantee complete security. Please use the paymaster at your own risk.

### Is there an SDK I can use to interact with the ERC-20 Paymaster?

You can use permissionless.js to easily interact with the ERC-20 Paymaster. Check out the [documentation](/permissionless/how-to/paymasters/use-custom-paymaster) for more information.

### Is the ERC-20 Paymaster permissionless?

Yes. You do not need to go through our backend API to interact with the ERC-20 Paymaster.

### Is the ERC-20 Paymaster decentralized?

Currently, no. There is an owner in the ERC-20 Paymaster contract that can update the `priceMarkup` up to a certain hardcoded threshold, as well as to withdraw the ERC-20 tokens accumulated by the paymaster.

### What admin controls does Pimlico have over the ERC-20 Paymaster?

The owner of the ERC-20 Paymaster has limited admin control. They can withdraw accumulated ERC-20 tokens from the contract for the purpose of swapping them back into native tokens and depositing them back into the paymaster. Additionally, the owner can update the `priceMarkup` and `priceUpdateThreshold` configurations within predefined limits to manage operational costs and risks.

### How can I use a token that is not currently supported by Pimlico?

Please get in touch with us. We will do what we can to see if we can add support for the token you are interested in.

You can only deploy the contract yourself.

### What are the tradeoffs versus a non-permissionless paymaster?

A non-permissionless paymaster could potentially offer a slightly smoother user experience as it could handle token approvals during the execution phase of the UserOperation. However, this would require interaction with a hosted API, which could introduce potential points of failure or trust. By contrast, this paymaster's permissionless design avoids these potential issues but requires users to manually handle token approvals.

However, it is possible to bypass this extra step for smart contract wallets if they are able to make an approve call either during the deployment of the smart contract, or during the validation step of the UserOperation.

### Does the owner take a fee?

Yes, the owner takes a fee in the form of a `priceMarkup` on the ERC-20 token price. This markup serves to compensate the onwer for maintaining the infrastructure and covering risks associated with price fluctuations and slippage risk. The default `priceMarkup` Pimlico takes is 10%, but that can depend on the token, so double-check before using the paymaster.

The `priceMarkup` can be changed by the owner of the paymaster, however there is a hardcoded maximum set during the contructor that is enforced by the smart contract. This means we can never set the `priceMarkup` to more than what is chosen during the constructor.


## ERC-20 Paymaster Guides

### Estimating Approval Amounts

When using Pimlico's ERC20-paymaster, the paymaster needs approval to spend funds on the payer's behalf. The amount to approve must be atleast equal to the userOperation's prefund value.

You can use the helper function below to get the required approval amount.

```ts
// Calculates amount of tokens that need to be approved for ERC20 paymaster to sponsor userOperation
const getApprovalAmount = async ({
    publicClient,
    paymasterAddress,

### Estimating Gas Cost

The helper function below shows an example on how to accurately estimate the gas cost of a UserOperation when using Pimlico's paymasters. The function expects a valid and signed UserOperation.

```ts
// Returns the cost of the UserOperation (denominated in token)
export const estimateCost = async ({
    userOperation,
    publicClient,
    paymasterAddress,
}: EstimateParams) => {
    const beneficiary = privateKeyToAddress(generatePrivateKey());

    const erc20Paymaster = getContract({
        address: paymasterAddress,
        abi: parseAbi(["function token() view returns (address)"]),
        client: publicClient,
    });
    const erc20Token = await erc20Paymaster.read.token();

    const multicall3Abi = parseAbi([
        "struct Result { bool success; bytes returnData; }",
        "struct Call3 { address target; bool allowFailure; bytes callData; }",
        "function aggregate3(Call3[] calldata calls) external payable returns (Result[] memory returnData)",
    ]);

    const entrypointAbi = parseAbi([
        "struct PackedUserOperation { address sender; uint256 nonce; bytes initCode; bytes callData; bytes32 accountGasLimits; uint256 preVerificationGas; bytes32 gasFees; bytes paymasterAndData; bytes signature; }",
        "function handleOps(PackedUserOperation[] calldata ops, address beneficiary)",
        "error FailedOp(uint256 opIndex, string reason)",
        "error FailedOpWithRevert(uint256 opIndex, string reason, bytes inner)",

## ERC-20 Paymaster

![Landscape](/erc20paymaster.png)

The ERC-20 Paymaster is an on-chain ERC-4337 paymaster that is able to pay for the gas fees of your users in exchange for ERC-20 tokens.

Pimlico is proud to have written and launched the first permissionless, fully-audited ERC-20 Paymaster 🎉

### Tutorials

Learning-oriented lessons that take you through a series of steps to complete a project. Most useful when you want to get started with Pimlico. They all involve the Alto Bundler.

* [Tutorial 2](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-2) leverages the ERC-20 Paymaster to sponsor the gas fees for a User Operation with USDC.

### References

References provide specific technical descriptions. They are most useful when you need detailed information about Pimlico's APIs.

* See the [official contract addresses of the ERC20 Paymaster on each chain](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/contract-addresses).

### Conceptual Guides

Conceptual guides provide high-level explanations of concepts. They are most useful when you need to understand the big picture.

* Understand more about the [architecture of our ERC20 Paymaster](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/architecture).
* Check out our [FAQs](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/faqs).


## Verifying Paymaster Common Errors

`Insufficient Pimlico balance for sponsorship, please top up`

This error means that you do not have enough Pimlico balance to sponsor the User Operation. Testnet User Operations are free to sponsor, but if you are trying to sponsor User Operations on a mainnet chain, [reach out to us](https://t.me/kristofgazso) to top up your balance.

`invalid 'apikey' query parameter` / `missing 'apikey' query parameter`

This error means that you have not provided a valid API key in the query parameters. You can find generate an API key by going through our [Quick Start guide](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys).

`chain XYZ is not supported`

This error means that the chain you are trying to sponsor a User Operation on is not supported by Pimlico. You can find the list of supported chains [here](/infra/platform/supported-chains). If there is a chain we do not yet support that you would like to see added, [reach out to us](https://t.me/kristofgazso).


## Verifying Paymaster Endpoints

All calls are in JSON-RPC format and have to be made to the following URL: `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/{chain}/rpc?apikey=[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]`

Where `{chain}` is the chain variable (such as `sepolia` or `polygon`) as found in the [supported chains page](/infra/platform/supported-chains)

### pm\_sponsorUserOperation (v2)

`pm_sponsorUserOperation` is the main endpoint for verifying paymasters. It takes in a User Operation, simulates it and estimates the gas limits, and then signs the User Operation with the verifying paymaster's key, sponsoring it when it is submitted on-chain. If successful, we deduct from your off-chain Pimlico balance.

You can optionally pass in a third parameter, `sponsorshipPolicyId`, which is a string that you can use to identify the sponsorship policy you want to use. To learn more about sponsorship policies, see [Sponsorship Policies](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies).

To use this endpoint, you must have an API key with Pimlico. Use our [Quick Start](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys) guide to generate one.

User Operations sponsored using pm\_sponsorUserOperation have a 10 minute time window during which they must be included. After this time window elapses, all unused gas will be refunded to your Pimlico balance.

This time limit is necessary in order to avoid DoS attacks, as leaving an infinite time window would allow potential attackers to accumulate User Operations and drain Pimlico's paymaster all in one go, requiring us to maintain enough balance to cover all possible User Operations we ever signed up to sponsor in the entire history of the paymaster.

If you require a longer time window for your User Operations, please get in touch!

### EntryPoint v0.7

:::warning[Warning]
The EntryPoint v0.7 API expects an `UnpackedUserOperation` instead of a `PackedUserOperation`.
According to the spec it is bundler's responsibility to pack the userOp before sending it to the EntryPoint.
So make sure to send an `UnpackedUserOperation` to the bundler.
:::

:::tip[Tip]
For entryPoint v0.7, we will revert if the execution of the `callData` in the user operation fails.
However, this is not the case for entryPoint v0.6.

## Paymaster FAQs \[Frequently Asked Questions about Pimlico's Verifying Paymaster]

### What's the difference between `pm_getPaymasterData` and `pm_sponsorUserOperation`?

`pm_getPaymasterData` is part of the [ERC-7677 spec](https://www.erc7677.xyz/introduction) which standardizes the way to request sponsorship for a given userOperation. `pm_getPaymasterData` doesn't do any gas estimations and only returns back the relevant userOperation fields for sponsorship.

* For v0.6, the endpoint returns
  * `paymasterAndData`
* For v0.7, the endpoint returns
  * `paymaster`
  * `paymasterData`.

`pm_sponsorUserOperation` is a Pimlico specific endpoint that also estimates gas as well as sponsoring the userOperation.

* For v0.6, the endpoint returns
  * `paymasterAndData`
  * `preVerificationGas`
  * `verificationGasLimit`
  * `callGasLimit`
* For v0.7, the endpoint returns
  * `paymaster`
  * `paymasterData`
  * `paymasterVerificationGasLimit`
  * `paymasterPostOpGasLimit`
  * `preVerificationGas`
  * `verificationGasLimit`
  * `callGasLimit`

### What's the difference between v1 and v2 endpoints?

V1 is for bundlers, while v2 is for paymasters. V2 for bundlers will be released soon with a long notice period for migration.

### What should I do after setting up a policy in the dashboard?

Decide whether to enable or disable the policy based on operational requirements and objectives. Enable it if you wish the policy to be active, or keep it disabled if not needed or under review.

### Can I make a transfer to load up my balance in a different currency?

Yes, you can make a transfer to load up your balance in a different currency, such as USDC. We also accept transfers in ETH. Please reach out to [us](https://t.me/kristofgazso) and provide the recipient address and specify the currency you wish to transfer.

### Are there any API-related payments?

No, there are not. The only payments relate to the onchain payments through the user operation gas price for the bundler fees, and the offchain balance deduction for the paymaster fees.

### How is payment made for the verifying paymaster?

:::info
The moment you request sponsorship, we pre-charge your balance with the maximum amount of balance your user operation could possibly spend (gas limits \* max gas price). After 15 minutes, we check onchain how much your user operation actually spent and refund the difference to your account.
:::

The verifying paymaster payments are charged offchain. We calculate how much gas in USD terms you spend and charge the percentage on top of that to your pre-loaded balance or attached card.

### How do gas fees for the bundler and paymaster stack?

If you use both the bundler and the paymaster together, the fee payments would stack.

For instance, if you ended up paying a 5% overhead for the bundler and a 10% overhead for the verifying paymaster on a user operation that costs us $0.01 to include, you would end up paying a total of $0.01 \* (1.05) \* (1.1) = $0.01155 => a 15.5% overhead.

Important to note however that the bundler and paymaster are completely independent and you can use one without the other.

### What is the use case for smart accounts

Smart accounts enable user experience improvements that were not previously possible with EOA accounts.

Examples include:

* Gasless transactions
* Use of USDC and other ERC-20 tokens for gas fee payments
* Trustless Passkey and FaceID signatures and login
* Account recovery
* Signer rotation
* Multisig and social recovery schemes
* Automated transactions (e.g. for limit orders, deadman switch, auto token revocations, automated DCA investing)
* Transactions with session keys with limited account access
* Batched transactions (e.g. being able to approve and swap in the same transaction)

### Is it possible to partially sponsor transactions with the verifying paymaster?

It is not natively possible to partially sponsor transactions with the verifying paymaster, however you can achieve a similar setup in a few different ways:

* You could sponsor all the gas fees, but for a more limited set of user operations using our [sponsorship policies](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies), for instance setting per user sponsorship limits, global spending limits, and more.
* You could also consider requiring your users to transfer a certain amount of ETH or ERC-20 tokens to an account you own for every transaction they do, making it so they in effect partially pay for the transaction fees.
* You could develop and maintain your own paymaster contract which allows the user to stake their tokens and make the sponsorship happen partially using the users' tokens.

### Does the verifying paymaster require upfront funding?

You can add balance on your [Pimlico dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) which will be used to sponsor gas fees, however you are also able to add a credit card, which will enable a $1000 overdraft limit which will be charged based on how much you sent at the end of every month.

:::info
If you would like to add to your balance using crypto, or you would like an overdraft limit higher than $1000, please [contact us](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
:::

### Would I get alerted if my balance is running out?

If you run out of balance or you reach your overdraft limit, the sponsor RPC methods will start erroring.

There is currently no alerting for your balance running low, but if this is a feature you would like please [contact us](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).

If you would like to restrict how much you spend, consider taking a look at our [sponsorship policies](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies) that could allow you, for instance, to set a global spend limit of $100,000 no matter what.


## Verifying Paymaster

Pimlico's Verifying Paymaster is a combination of an API and an on-chain smart contract that allows you to sponsor gas fees for your users. By calling our API, you get back a signature that will be accepted by our smart contract and will pay for the gas fees of your users.

### Tutorials

Learning-oriented lessons that take you through a series of steps to complete a project. Most useful when you want to get started with Pimlico. They all involve the Alto Bundler.

* [Tutorial 1](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1) leverages the Verifying Paymaster to sponsor the gas fees for a User Operation.

### References

References provide specific technical descriptions. They are most useful when you need detailed information about Pimlico's APIs.

* The [supported chains page](/infra/platform/supported-chains) for the verifying paymaster explains the chains and networks that are supported and the API endpoints you can use to interact with it.


## How to use the Verifying Paymaster

:::tip[Tip]
We recommend using [permissionless.js](/permissionless/reference/smart-account-actions/sendUserOperation) as the SDK to interact with the Verifying Paymaster as it provides type-safe wrappers for paymaster methods.
:::

Paymasters are entities that user operations can delegate the responsibilities for gas fee payments for. You can interact with paymasters using JSON-RPC requests.

To get access to the paymaster, you need to sign up to the [Pimlico dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io), create a [Pimlico API key](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys). Next, load up some balance to your Pimlico account in the [payment methods page](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/payment) or add your card. Then, using the API key, you can make the following JSON-RPC requests to the paymaster:

* [pm\_sponsorUserOperation](/infra/paymaster/verifying-paymaster/endpoints/pm_sponsorUserOperation)

If you would like an end-to-end example of how to use the Verifying Paymaster, please refer to [tutorial 1](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1) of the permissionless.js documentation.

## How to create a user operation which converts ETH to USDC on Uniswap V3

This guide demonstrates how to create a user operation that swaps ETH for USDC using Uniswap V3. By leveraging Account Abstraction and Pimlico's infrastructure, you can create gasless swaps and provide a seamless experience for your users.

### Prerequisites

* A Pimlico API key (get one from the [Pimlico Dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io))
* Basic understanding of Account Abstraction and ERC-4337
* Familiarity with TypeScript and Viem
* Access to a network with Uniswap V3 deployed (we'll use Sepolia in this example)

### Steps

::::steps
#### Set up the clients

First, we need to set up the necessary clients for interacting with the blockchain and Pimlico's services. We'll create a public client for reading from the blockchain and a Pimlico client for interacting with Pimlico's bundler and paymaster services.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:clients]
```

#### Create a smart account

For this guide, we'll use a Safe smart account. This account is an ERC-4337 wallet controlled by a single EOA signer.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:smartAccount]
```

#### Create the smart account client

Now that we have a `SmartAccount` instance, we need to create a `SmartAccountClient` instance to be able to transact from it. We'll also configure it to use Pimlico's bundler and paymaster services.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Define the Uniswap V3 interface

To interact with Uniswap V3, we need to define the ABI for the functions we'll be using. We'll also define the addresses for the Uniswap V3 Router, WETH, and USDC tokens.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:uniswapInterfaces]
```

:::info
The addresses provided in this example are for the Sepolia testnet. Make sure to replace them with the correct addresses for the network you're using.
:::

#### Create swap helper functions

Now, let's create helper functions for getting a quote and creating the calldata for swapping ETH to USDC.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:swapFunctions]
```

These functions handle:

1. Getting a quote for the expected amount of USDC to receive
2. Calculating the minimum amount out based on slippage
3. Setting a deadline for the swap
4. Encoding the function call to the Uniswap V3 Router

#### Execute the swap

Finally, let's create a function to execute the swap and submit the user operation.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:executeSwap]
```

This function:

1. Gets the ETH from FlashFund
2. Gets a quote for the expected amount of USDC
3. Creates the swap calldata
4. Submits the user operation to the bundler
5. Returns the transaction hash

#### Run the swap

Now, let's execute the swap with a small amount of ETH.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/flash-fund/eth-to-usdc-uniswap.ts:main]
```

When you run this code, you should see output similar to:

```
Smart account address: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x...
Swapping 0.01 ETH for USDC...
Expected to receive approximately 25.123456 USDC for 0.01 ETH
Swap transaction submitted: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x...
```

## Credit Mode

FlashFund Credit mode is designed for developers who want to provide instant ETH access to their users across multiple chains without requiring users to lock their own tokens. This mode is perfect for demos, testing, and small-scale applications.

### Overview

Credit mode simplifies token access by shifting liquidity management from users to developers. Developers can top up their balance through the Pimlico dashboard and instantly provide ETH to users on any supported chain using their API key.

### Key Features

* **Instant ETH Provision**: Provide ETH instantly on any supported chain
* **Developer-Funded Model**: Manage funds through the Pimlico dashboard
* **Webhook Support**: Monitor and validate withdrawals
* **Simple Integration**: Minimal setup required
* **Currently ETH Only**: Support for ETH withdrawals across all supported chains

### How It Works

1. **Developer Setup**
   * Get a Pimlico API key in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys)
   * Enable FlashFund feature for your API key
   * Add funds to your FlashFund balance through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/billing/payment-methods)

2. **User Flow**
   * User requests ETH on a specific chain
   * Developer uses API to request signed withdrawal message
   * User receives ETH directly on the target chain

3. **Fund Management**
   * Monitor balance through the dashboard
   * Set up automatic top-ups (optional)
   * Track usage with webhooks

### Next Steps

* [Check Supported Chains and Tokens](/infra/flash-fund/supported-chains-and-tokens)
* [Learn About Resource Lock Mode](/infra/flash-fund/modes/resource-lock)


## Resource Lock Mode

FlashFundResource Lock mode is designed for production-scale applications, enabling users to lock their tokens in specialized smart contracts and instantly access ETH across any supported chain through simple message signing.

### Overview

Resource Lock mode eliminates the need for developer funding by allowing users to lock their own tokens in specialized contracts (OneBalance or Pimlico Lock). This enables immediate cross-chain liquidity while maintaining user control over their assets.

### Key Features

* **No Developer Funding Required**: Users lock their own tokens
* **User-Controlled Assets**: Users maintain control over their locked funds
* **Instant Cross-Chain Access**: Quick access to ETH on any supported chain
* **Multiple Lock Types**: Choose between Pimlico Lock and OneBalance
* **Currently ETH Only**: Support for ETH withdrawals across all supported chains

### How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**
   * Choose a resource lock type (Pimlico Lock or OneBalance)
   * Set up necessary integrations

2. **User Flow**
   * User locks their tokens in the chosen resource lock
   * User requests ETH on desired chain
   * User signs allowance message
   * User receives ETH on target chain

3. **Lock Management**
   * Users can monitor their locked balances
   * Pimlico has no custody of the locked funds
   * Users can exist resource lock even if the API is down

### Resource Lock Types

#### Pimlico Lock

* Native integration with Pimlico infrastructure
* Optimized for FlashFund operations
* Simple locking and unlocking mechanism
* Direct ETH locking

#### OneBalance Lock

* Integration with OneBalance ecosystem
* Additional token support (coming soon)

### Next Steps

* [Learn About Credit Mode](/infra/flash-fund/modes/credit)


## Pagination

The Pimlico platform API supports certain “list” API methods. For example, you can list sponsorship policies. These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: `limit`, `starting_after`, and `ending_before`.

Pimlico's list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the `starting_after` and `ending_before` parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The `ending_before` parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The `starting_after` parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the starting\_after or ending\_before parameter, but not both simultaneously.

### Query Parameters

#### limit

* **optional, default is 100**

This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.

#### starting\_after

* **optional object ID**

A cursor to use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include starting\_after=obj\_foo to fetch the next page of the list.

#### ending\_before

* **optional object ID**

A cursor to use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include ending\_before=obj\_bar to fetch the previous page of the list.

## API Upgrade

We are announcing a change to our API behavior for the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` method. Previously, our system provided a default ETH balance override when estimating gas for User Operations. This default override will soon be removed.

### What’s Changing?

#### No More Default ETH Balance Override

After the change goes into effect, we will not add an ETH balance override by default when you call `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`.

#### Possible AA21 Error

If a User Operation is not sponsored by a paymaster and the sender does not have enough ETH to cover the operation’s cost, you will encounter an AA21 error.

#### If Users Have Sufficient Balance

If you already expect users to hold enough ETH for non-sponsored transactions, no changes are required on your end. You should be able to upgrade without any issues. Click [here](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys/upgrade) to upgrade.

### Estimating Without a User’s Balance

If you need to estimate a User Operation for a sender without sufficient balance, you can add state overrides to the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` method.

##### Upgrade with permissionless

:::code-group
```ts [upgrade.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/infra/platform/api/upgrade/upgrade.ts]
```

```ts [createSmartAccountClient.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/infra/platform/api/upgrade/createSmartAccountClient.ts]
```
:::

##### Upgrade to the raw API

You can use state overrides to simulate the user operation with a different
state the same way you would with
[`eth_call`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-eth#eth-call)
by including an optional third parameter. This is supported for both EntryPoint
v0.6 and v0.7.

## How to debug dropped user operations

If a user operation is dropped in the mempool of the bundler after initially being accepted by it, the error can not be propagated by the bundler to the user. To debug what happened to these user operations, we recommend using the [User Operation Tracking](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/debugging/tracking) page on our dashboard, which will show you the exact flow of the user operation stage-by-stage through Pimlico's bundler with timestamps, including any errors it encounters.

An example screenshot of the User Operation Tracking page is shown below:

![User Operation Tracking page, showing a dropped user operation](/tracking.png)


## How to Protect Your API Keys

Keeping your API keys secure is essential. Here are three main ways to protect them:

* Restrict access to your API keys.
* Use sponsorship policies.
* Use a proxy server to handle requests to Pimlico.

### Restrict Access to Your API Keys

You can limit how your API keys are used by modifying their permissions on the [API Keys page](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys). Restrictions can include:

* **IP addresses:** Specify which IPs are allowed to make requests.
* **User agents:** Limit access to specific browsers, SDK versions, or other user agents.
* **Origins:** Define which domains are permitted to make requests.

Additionally, you can enable or disable specific API features for each key, such as:

* Bundler methods.
* Paymaster methods.
* Account APIs.

### Use Sponsorship Policies

Sponsorship Policies are hosted policies that allow you to define custom rules for sponsorships.

You can put limits to the global amount of sponsorships, the amount of sponsorships per user, and per user operation.

You can read more about Sponsorship Policies [here](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies).

### Use a Proxy Server

You can create a proxy server to handle requests to Pimlico. This way, you can have custom authentication, rate limiting, and other features before forwarding requests to Pimlico.

Here's an example of how you can create a proxy server for `fastify` and `express`:

:::code-group
```typescript [fastify.ts]
import Fastify from 'fastify'
import proxy from '@fastify/http-proxy'

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })
const PIMLICO_API_KEY = process.env.PIMLICO_API_KEY

// Middleware to check authentication
fastify.addHook('preHandler', async (request, reply) => {
  const authHeader = request.headers.authorization
  
  if (!authHeader || !isValidAuth(authHeader)) {
    reply.code(401).send({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
  }
})

// Setup proxy to Pimlico API
fastify.register(proxy, {
  upstream: `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/137/rpc?apikey=${PIMLICO_API_KEY}`,
  prefix: '/api/proxy',
  rewriteRequestHeaders: (req, headers) => ({
    ...headers,
  })
})

// Start server
fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
})

// Helper function to validate auth
function isValidAuth(authHeader: string): boolean {
  // Implement your authentication logic here
  return true
}

```

```typescript [express.ts]
import express from 'express';
import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'http-proxy-middleware';

const app = express();
const PIMLICO_API_KEY = process.env.PIMLICO_API_KEY;
const targetUrl = `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/137/rpc?apikey=${PIMLICO_API_KEY}`;


// Middleware to check authentication
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  
  if (!authHeader || !isValidAuth(authHeader)) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  next();
});

// Setup proxy to Pimlico API
app.use('/api/proxy',  createProxyMiddleware({
    target: targetUrl,
    changeOrigin: true,
    pathRewrite: {
      '^/api/proxy': '', // Remove '/proxy' from the path
    },
    onProxyReq: (proxyReq, req) => {
      // Ensure JSON content type
      proxyReq.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    },
  }));

// Start server
app.listen(3000, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

// Helper function to validate auth
function isValidAuth(authHeader: string): boolean {
  // Implement your authentication logic here
  return true;
}

## How to create a gas program on Pimlico

:::info
This guide is for chain operators who want to create a gas program on Pimlico. If you are a developer looking to use a gas program made by someone else or looking to sponsor your own user operations, you should instead look in the [sponsorship policies guide](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies).
:::

If you are a chain operator and you would like to be able to easily give out and track gas credits to developers building on your chain, you can create and manage a gas station program using Pimlico sponsorship policies.

:::steps
#### Create a Pimlico account

If you don't already have a Pimlico account, you can create one by visiting the [Pimlico dashboard website](https://dashboard.pimlico.io).

#### Create an switch to an organization (optional)

If you are not already in an organization, you can create one by clicking on the "Create Organization" button on the dashboard.

![A screenshot of the Pimlico dashboard with the organization viewer open](/policies/gasprogram1.png)

#### Create a sponsorship policy

The gas program will be managed as a sponsorship policy. You can create a sponsorship policy by clicking on the "Create Policy" button on the [sponsorship policies page](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies).

![A screenshot of the Pimlico dashboard with the sponsorship policy viewer open](/policies/gasprogram2.png)

As part of creating the policy, we recommend you consider setting a couple of fields:

* Name (to identify the policy publicly, e.g. "XYZChain Gas Program")
* Enabled Chains (to specify that the policy should only apply to your chain)
* Global Maximum (to hardcode the maximum dollars of gas that can be spent)

You can also consider setting some other fields, like custom webhooks, start and end dates, and more.

#### Give authorizations to developers to use the policy

To give authorizations to developers to use this policy, start by clicking on the newly created policy, which should take you to the policy's dashboard.

In it, you should see a "Spending Authorizations" table where you can add new authorizations.

![A screenshot of the spending authorizations table in the policy dashboard](/policies/gasprogram3.png)

Now click the "Create Spending Authorization" button and fill in the details of the authorization, including the name of the authorization, how many dollars of gas you're letting the developer spending, and the reset period.

![A screenshot of the spending authorization creation form](/policies/gasprogram4.png)

After you have created the policy, you should see a page where you can copy a link that you can send to the grantee to claim the spending authorization.

To use the policy, the grantee will need to have a Pimlico account and will need to click on the link to claim the authorization, and will then be able to use that authorization to pay for gas on your chain as if it was a policy that they owned. More information about using sponsorship policies can be found in the [relevant guide](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies).

## How to use Sponsorship Policies

### What are Sponsorship Policies?

Sponsorship Policies are hosted policies that allow you to define custom rules for sponsorships.

You can put limits to the global amount of sponsorships, the amount of sponsorships per user, and per user operation.

Start by going to the [sponsorship policies page](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies) on the Pimlico dashboard and clicking on the "Create Policy" button.

![](https://i.imgur.com/sJM7l7m.png)

### Usage of Sponsorship Policies with permisionless.js

If you are using [permissionless.js](/permissionless), you can use the `PimlicoPaymasterClient` to use sponsorship policies.

:::steps
#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the SimpleAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies/index.ts:client]
```

#### Create an account

Now, create an account. This can any of the accounts supported by permissionless.js or custom accounts conforming to the interface. For this example, we'll use a Simple account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies/index.ts:account]
```

#### Create the smart account client with middleware

When creating the `smartAccountClient`, we can pass in a `middleware.sponsorUserOperation` function that will be called before a user operation is signed and sent.
This is where we can pass in the `sponsorshipPolicyId` that we want to use.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies/index.ts:smart-account-client]
```
:::

### Usage of Sponsorship Policies API

After creating a policy, you can take its ID and use it by passing it into the `pm_sponsorUserOperation` method. If the user operation does not meet the requirements of the policy, the method will return an error.

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "pm_sponsorUserOperation",
    "params": [
        {
            "sender": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
            "nonce": "0x1",
            "initCode": "0x",
            "callData": "0x",
            "callGasLimit": "0x100000",
            "verificationGasLimit": "0x20000",
            "preVerificationGas": "0x10000",
            "maxFeePerGas": "0x3b9aca00",
            "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "0x3b9aca00",
            "paymasterAndData": "0x",
            "signature": "0x"
        },
        "0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789",
        {
            "sponsorshipPolicyId": "sp_amused_gladiator"
        }
    ],
    "id": 1
}
```


## How to use Sponsorship Policy webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when sponsorship-related events occur. You can use webhooks to approve or reject sponsorship requests and receive notifications about finalized sponsorships. Start by going to the [sponsorship policies page](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies) on the Pimlico dashboard, clicking on the existing policy and clicking on the "Edit button".

### Webhook Types

#### UserOperation Sponsorship

These webhooks are triggered when using the [pm\_sponsorUserOperation](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/endpoints/pm_sponsorUserOperation) endpoint.

##### Request for Sponsorship

```typescript
const body = {
    type: "user_operation.sponsorship.requested",
    data: {
        object: {
            userOperation,
            entryPoint,
            chainId,
            sponsorshipPolicyId,
            apiKey
        }
    }
}
```

The webhook must return a response with the following structure:

```json
{
    "sponsor": true // Boolean - whether to approve the sponsorship
}
```

##### Sponsorship Finalized

Sent when a UserOperation sponsorship is approved and finalized:

```typescript
const body = {
    type: "user_operation.sponsorship.finalized",
    data: {
        object: {
            userOperation,
            entryPoint,
            chainId,
            sponsorshipPolicyId,
            apiKey
        }
    }
}
```

#### FlashFund Withdrawal

These webhooks are triggered when using the [flashfund\_sponsorWithdrawal](/infra/flash-fund/endpoints/flashfund_sponsorWithdrawal) endpoint.

##### Request for Withdrawal

Sent when a FlashFund withdrawal sponsorship is requested:

```typescript
const body = {
    type: "flash_fund.sponsorship.requested",
    data: {
        object: {
            recipient,
            token,
            amount,
            signature,
            chainId,
            apiKey,
            sponsorshipPolicyId
        }
    }
}
```

The webhook must return a response with the following structure:

```json
{
    "sponsor": true // Boolean - whether to approve the withdrawal
}
```

##### Withdrawal Finalized

Sent when a FlashFund withdrawal is approved and finalized:

```typescript
const body = {
    type: "flash_fund.sponsorship.finalized",
    data: {
        object: {
            withdrawal,
            hash,
            signature,
            chainId,
            apiKey,
            sponsorshipPolicyId
        }
    }
}
```

### How to verify the webhook

To verify the webhook, you can use the `@pimlico/webhook` package. You will need to provide the webhook secret, which you can find in the sponsorship policy [settings](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies).

#### Installation

```bash
pnpm install @pimlico/webhook
```

#### Usage

```typescript
import { pimlicoWebhookVerifier } from "@pimlico/webhook"
import type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from "@vercel/node"

const webhookSecret = process.env.PIMLICO_WEBHOOK_SECRET as string

const verifyWebhook = pimlicoWebhookVerifier(webhookSecret)

export default async function handler(req: VercelRequest, res: VercelResponse) {
    const webhookEvent = verifyWebhook(
        req.headers as Record<string, string>,
        JSON.stringify(req.body)
    )

    // Handle different webhook types
    switch(webhookEvent.type) {
        case "sponsorshipPolicy.webhook":
        case "user_operation.sponsorship.requested":
        case "flash_fund.sponsorship.requested":
            return res.status(200).json({
                sponsor: true
            })
        case "user_operation.sponsorship.finalized":
        case "flash_fund.sponsorship.finalized":
            // Handle notification - no response needed
            return res.status(200).end()
        default:
            return res.status(400).json({ error: "Unknown webhook type" })
    }
}
```


## Why Pimlico for Enterprises

Are you an enterprise looking to leverage smart accounts and wondering why you should use Pimlico as your account abstraction infrastructure provider?

Below are some reasons why some of the best enterprise teams in crypto have chosen to work with Pimlico.

### Expert, veteran team

When you partner with Pimlico, you partner with our veteran team that has been working in the account abstraction space for years. We are co-authors of some of the most important smart account standards (such as [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), [ERC-7679](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7679), [ERC-7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677)), are early supporters of many more, and are still constantly innovating at the frontier.

When you face issues, get stuck, have questions about the technicals behind smart accounts and account abstraction, or would like to brainstorm together on how to best leverage smart accounts for your enterprise, you can expect fast, helpful support from our team of developers who are always ready to help.

### Scalable and customizable

At Pimlico, we built our platform for scale. Our servers are regularly load tested, and our bundlers have been designed to be handle many hundreds of user operations in parallel. This means you can build with confidence, knowing that your smart accounts will always be able to handle the load.

Pimlico is also built to be customizable to fit your enterprise's needs. Out of the box, we support:

* [70+ chains](/infra/platform/supported-chains)
* [All ERC-4337 smart accounts implementations, and all official EntryPoint versions](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/support)
* [Sponsorship policies](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies) with global, per user, per user operation spending limits, custom webhook validation, and more
* API key authentication and authorization options

In addition to the built in customization features, we can work with you to:

* Deploy our infrastructure and platform to custom chains
* Develop custom bundler modifications to fit your needs
* Support custom EntryPoint contracts

* [permissionless.js](/permissionless/why), a smart account-focused TypeScript library that supports any bundler and paymaster providers and all major smart account implementations, built by developers for developers with over 20,000 weekly NPM downloads.

### Pay-as-you-go pricing options

With Pimlico's pay-as-you-go plan, you can build with confidence knowing that you only pay for what you use. This means you can start building with smart accounts without having to commit to a long-term contract, and can scale your usage up or down as needed.

If you prefer a more predictable billing model, we can also offer [enterprise pricing plans](/infra/platform/why-pimlico/enterprise) that are tailored to your needs, with a discount on API credits and dedicated 1-1 support from our team.

### Lightning-fast integration times

We built Pimlico with a focus on smooth onboarding and lightning-fast integration times, making it as easy as possible for you to get started with smart accounts. The Pimlico platform is also selve-serve, so there is no need to wait for a sales call or a demo to get started.

We built our SDKs and APIs to be clean, modern, and well-typed, as well as having it be documentated comprehensively. This means you can expect to be up and running with smart accounts in a matter of hours, not weeks.

## How to create and use a Biconomy account with permissionless.js

[Biconomy Smart Account](https://github.com/bcnmy/scw-contracts) is a smart account building on the core concepts of Gnosis and Argent safes. You can use Biconomy with plugins such as session keys, and even write your own plugins.

### Steps

:::steps
#### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:imports]
```

#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the Biconomy account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:clients]
```

#### Create the signer

Biconomy accounts can work with a variety of signing algorithms such as ECDSA, passkeys, and multisig. In permissionless.js, the default Biconomy account validates ECDSA signatures. [Any signer](/permissionless/how-to/signers) can be used as a signer for the Biconomy account.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:signer]
```

#### Create the Biconomy account

With a signer, you can create a Biconomy account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:smartAccount]
```

The Biconomy account address is computed deterministically from the signer, but you can optionally pass an `index` to create any number of different accounts using the same signer. You can also pass an `address` to use an already created Biconomy account.

#### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:submitBatch]
```

## How to create and use a Coinbase smart account with permissionless.js

:::warning[Warning]
You should still use permissionless to fetch gas prices. As the bundler might not accept the prices fetched from viem. To learn how to use permissionless to fetch gas prices, [check out this guide](/permissionless/reference/pimlico-actions/getUserOperationGasPrice#getuseroperationgasprice).
:::

Coinbase smart wallet accounts are supported natively by viem. We recommend using the native viem implementation for which the documentation [can be found here](https://viem.sh/account-abstraction/accounts/smart/toCoinbaseSmartAccount).


## How to use an ERC-7579 compatible smart account with permissionless.js

[ERC-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579) defines a standard for modular smart account interfaces. It also defines behavior for interoperability with minimal restrictions for accounts and modules.

Currently Safe and Kernel are the only smart accounts that implements ERC-7579.

For this guide, we will use the Safe smart accounts as an example. If you would like to find out more about the Safe smart account, you can check out the [Safe-specific guide](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-safe-account).

This guide will show you how to create and use a ERC-7579 compatible smart account with permissionless.js.

### Steps

::::steps
#### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc7579/erc7579.ts:imports]
```

#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the SafeAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc7579/erc7579.ts:clients]
```

#### Create the SafeAccount

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a SafeAccount, take a look at the reference documentation page for [`toSafeSmartAccount`](/permissionless/reference/accounts/toSafeSmartAccount).
:::

You can also pass an `address` to use an already created SafeAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc7579/erc7579.ts:smartAccount]
```

:::warning
The Safe account requires a new `safe4337ModuleAddress` & `erc7579LaunchpadAddress` for it to be 7579 compatible.
:::

:::warning
The address `0x000000333034E9f539ce08819E12c1b8Cb29084d` belongs to Rhinestone. By designating them as attesters, you authorize that only modules explicitly approved by Rhinestone can be installed on your safe.
:::

#### Create the smart account client and extend it with the ERC7579 actions

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc7579/erc7579.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Interact with the 7579 actions

You can install a module on the Safe account using the `installModule` action.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc7579/erc7579.ts:installModule]
```

:::warning
InstallModule returns user operation hash, not transaction hash, you must use `waitForUserOperationReceipt` to wait for the user operation to be included on-chain.
:::

You can also call all other ERC7579 actions, example `supportsExecutionMode`.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc7579/erc7579.ts:supportsExecutionMode]
```

## How to create and use a Kernel account with permissionless.js

:::info
ZeroDev, the author of Kernel, maintains their own in-house SDK built closely on top of permissionless.js that you can use for the account system while still plugging in all the other components from permissionless.js. Take a look at [their documentation](https://docs.zerodev.app) for more information.
:::

[Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel) is a **modular smart account** that supports plugins, which are smart contracts that extend the account's functionalities.  You can use Kernel with popular plugins such as session keys and account recovery, and even write your own plugins.  Kernel is compatible with [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/).

### Picking an EntryPoint

Kernel is compatible with EntryPoint versions v0.6 and v0.7.

If you are building a new application, we recommend using EntryPoint v0.7, which gives you the latest and greatest features and optimizations. If you already have an application using Kernel on EntryPoint v0.6, just stick with it -- it will be supported indefinitely.

In this guide, we will use EntryPoint v0.7.

### Steps

::::steps
#### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/kernel.ts:imports]
```

#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the Kernel account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/kernel.ts:clients]
```

#### Create the signer

Kernel accounts can work with a variety of signing algorithms such as ECDSA, passkeys, and multisig. In permissionless.js, the default Kernel account validates ECDSA signatures. [Any signer](/permissionless/how-to/signers) can be used as a signer for the Kernel account.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/kernel.ts:signer]
```

#### Create the Kernel account

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a Kernel account, take a look at the reference documentation page for [`toKernelSmartAccount`](/permissionless/reference/accounts/toKernelSmartAccount).
:::

With a signer, you can create a Kernel account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/kernel.ts:smartAccount]
```

The Kernel address is computed deterministically from the signer, but you can optionally pass an `index` to create any number of different accounts using the same signer. You can also pass an `address` to use an already created Kernel account.

#### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/kernel.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts

## How to create and use a LightAccount with permissionless.js

[LightAccount](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account) is the smart account implementation made by Alchemy and inspired by SimpleAccount.
It has a few additional [features](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/light-account?tab=readme-ov-file#features), such as transferrable ownership and upgradability.
This guide will show you how to create and use a LightAccount with permissionless.js.

### Steps

::::steps
#### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:imports]
```

#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the LightAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:clients]
```

#### Create the LightAccount

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a LightAccount, take a look at the reference documentation page for [`toLightSmartAccount`](/permissionless/reference/accounts/toLightSmartAccount).
:::

You can also pass an `address` to use an already created LightAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:smartAccount]
```

#### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/light.ts:submitBatch]

## How to create and use a Biconomy Nexus account with permissionless.js

[Biconomy Nexus Smart Account](https://github.com/bcnmy/nexus) is a smart account building on the core concepts of ERC-7579. You can use Nexus with plugins such as session keys, and even write your own plugins.

### Steps

:::steps
#### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:imports]
```

#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the Nexus account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:clients]
```

#### Create the signer

Nexus accounts can work with a variety of signing algorithms such as ECDSA, passkeys, and multisig. In permissionless.js, the default Nexus account validates ECDSA signatures. [Any signer](/permissionless/how-to/signers) can be used as a signer for the Nexus account.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:signer]
```

#### Create the Nexus account

With a signer, you can create a Nexus account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:smartAccount]
```

The Nexus account address is computed deterministically from the signer, but you can optionally pass an `index` to create any number of different accounts using the same signer. You can also pass an `address` to use an already created Nexus account.

#### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/biconomy.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

## How to create and use a Safe account with multiple signers

[Safe](https://safe.global) is the most battle-tested Ethereum smart account provider. With their recent release of their ERC-4337 module, it is now possible to plug in Safe accounts to ERC-4337 bundlers and paymasters. This guide will walk you through how to create and use a Safe account with permissionless.js.

### Steps

::::steps
#### Import the required packages

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe-multi-sig.ts:imports]
```

#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the Safe account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe-multi-sig.ts:clients]
```

#### Get the owner addresses

The Safe account will need to have a signer to sign user operations. In permissionless.js, the default Safe account validates ECDSA signatures. [Any permissionless.js-compatible signer](/permissionless/how-to/signers) can be used for the Safe account.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe-multi-sig.ts:signer]
```

#### Create the Safe account

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a Safe account, take a look at the reference documentation page for [`toSafeSmartAccount`](/permissionless/reference/accounts/toSafeSmartAccount).
:::

With a signer, you can create a Safe account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe-multi-sig.ts:smartAccount]
```

:::info
You can also create a Safe account with 7579 module, read more about it [here](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-erc7579-account).
:::

#### Create the smart account client

The smart account client is a permissionless.js client that is meant to serve as an almost drop-in replacement for viem's [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet.html).

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe-multi-sig.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Prepare a user operation

Since we may not have access to all the signers at once, we should prepare a user operation and then submit it later after all the signers have signed.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe-multi-sig.ts:prepare]
```

#### Collect signatures

You can use the `SafeSmartAccount.signUserOperation` method to collect signatures from the signers.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe-multi-sig.ts:sign]
```

#### Submit the user operation

Once you have the  final signature, you can submit the user operation.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/safe-multi-sig.ts:submit]
```

#### Understanding the errors

If you're getting an error that starts with `GS`, it probably means that something went off with the Safe account. Checkout the Safe error codes [here](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/main/docs/error_codes.md).

## How to conditionally sponsor a user operation

The permissionless.js library allows you to conditionally sponsor a user operation. This can be useful in situations like:

* Sponsor only first 10 transactions
* Sponsor if they have a specific NFT

The use cases can be many, but the general idea is to use the `middleware.sponsorUserOperation` parameter to conditionally sponsor a user operation.

Let's take an example where you want to sponsor only the first 10 transactions.

:::steps
#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the SimpleAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:client]
```

#### Create an account

Now, create an account. This can any of the accounts supported by permissionless.js or custom accounts conforming to the interface. For this example, we'll use a Simple account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:account]
```

#### Create the smart account client with the custom paymaster logic

When creating the `smartAccountClient`, we can pass in a `middleware.sponsorUserOperation` function that will be called before a user operation is signed and sent.
This function can conditionally choose to add a paymaster to the user operation if the desired conditions are met.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:smart-account-client]
```
:::


## How to use a custom paymaster with accounts in permissionless.js

permissionless.js allows you to define custom logic to select the paymaster (if any) to use with the accounts you control. This allows you to use your own paymaster or even use multiple paymasters in different scenarios.

::::steps
#### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the SimpleAccount.

```ts
export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
    chain: sepolia,
    transport: http("https://sepolia.rpc.thirdweb.com"),
})

const pimlicoUrl = `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=${apiKey}`

export const pimlicoClient = createPimlicoClient({
    transport: http(pimlicoUrl),
    entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7",
    },
})
```

#### Create an account

Now, create an account. This can any of the accounts supported by permissionless.js or custom accounts conforming to the interface. For this example, we'll use a Simple account.

```ts
const simpleAccount = await toSimpleSmartAccount({
    client: publicClient,
    owner: privateKeyToAccount(privateKey),
    entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7",
    }
})
```

#### Create the smart account client with the custom paymaster logic

When creating the `smartAccountClient`, we can pass in a `sponsorUserOperation` function that will be called before a user operation is signed and sent. This function must return the `paymasterAndData`, `preVerificationGas`, `verificationGasLimit`, and `callGasLimit` fields.

:::code-group
```ts [Pimlico Paymaster]
const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    account,
    chain: sepolia,
    bundlerTransport: http(pimlicoUrl),
    paymaster: pimlicoClient,
    userOperation: {
        estimateFeesPerGas: async () => {
            return (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast
        },
    }
})
```

You can also set completely custom client-side logic to select the paymaster to use. This can be useful if you want to use multiple paymasters in different scenarios.

```ts [ERC-20 Paymaster]
const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    client: publicClient,
    account,
    chain: sepolia,
    bundlerTransport: http(pimlicoUrl),
    paymaster: {
        async getPaymasterData(parameters) {
            const gasEstimates = await pimlicoClient.estimateUserOperationGas({
                ...parameters,
                paymaster: erc20PaymasterAddress,
            })
            return {
                paymaster: erc20PaymasterAddress,
                paymasterData: "0x" as Hex,
                paymasterPostOpGasLimit: gasEstimates.paymasterPostOpGasLimit ?? 0n,
                paymasterVerificationGasLimit: gasEstimates.paymasterVerificationGasLimit ?? 0n,
            }
        },
        async getPaymasterStubData(parameters) {
            return {
                paymaster: erc20PaymasterAddress,
                paymasterData: "0x" as Hex,
                paymasterVerificationGasLimit: 50_000n,
                paymasterPostOpGasLimit: 20_000n
            }
        }
    },
    userOperation: {
        estimateFeesPerGas: async () => {
            return (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast
        },
    }
})
```

```ts [Dynamic Paymaster Logic]
const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    client: publicClient,
    account,
    chain: sepolia,
    bundlerTransport: http(pimlicoUrl),
    paymaster: {
        async getPaymasterData(parameters) {
            const usdcBalance = usdcToken.read.getBalance([account.address]) // get the user's usdc token balance on sepolia

            if (usdcBalance > parseEther("10")) {
                const gasEstimates = await pimlicoClient.estimateUserOperationGas({
                    ...parameters,
                    paymaster: erc20PaymasterAddress,
                })
                return {
                    paymaster: erc20PaymasterAddress,
                    paymasterData: "0x" as Hex,
                    paymasterPostOpGasLimit: gasEstimates.paymasterPostOpGasLimit ?? 0n,
                    paymasterVerificationGasLimit: gasEstimates.paymasterVerificationGasLimit ?? 0n,
                }
            } else {
                return pimlicoClient.getPaymasterStubData(parameters)
            }
        },
        async getPaymasterStubData(parameters) {
            const usdcBalance = usdcToken.read.getBalance([account.address]) // get the user's usdc token balance on sepolia

            if (usdcBalance > parseEther("10")) {
                const usdcPaymaster = "0x0000000000325602a77416A16136FDafd04b299f" // usdc paymaster on sepolia
                return {
                    paymaster: usdcPaymaster,
                    paymasterData: "0x" as Hex,
                    paymasterVerificationGasLimit: 50_000n,
                    paymasterPostOpGasLimit: 20_000n
                }
            } else {
                // otherwise sponsor it for the user
                return pimlicoClient.getPaymasterStubData(parameters)
            }
        }
    },
    userOperation: {

            return (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast
        },
    }
})
```
:::

#### Send a transaction

You can now send transactions as normal. The `sponsorUserOperation` function will be called before each transaction is signed and sent, applying the custom paymaster logic you have set.

```ts
const txHash = await smartAccountClient.sendTransaction({
    to: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045",
    value: parseEther("0.1")
});

## How to use a Dynamic signer with permissionless.js

permissionless.js allows you to plug in custom signers to control the accounts that you create. Dynamic is an embedded wallet provider that allows you to easily onboard users to your dapp. It is possible to use Dynamic as a signer with permissionless.js, allowing you to use Dynamic to create and control smart accounts and sign transactions.

:::steps
#### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm i @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core @dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector @dynamic-labs/ethereum permissionless viem wagmi
```

#### Create the Dynamic provider

Following Dynamic's [quickstart guide](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/quickstart), set up the Dynamic provider in your app. Also integrate the DynamicWagmiConnector, which will allow you to use Dynamic as a signer with permissionless.js.

```ts
import {
  DynamicContextProvider,
  DynamicWidget,
} from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { DynamicWagmiConnector } from "@dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector";

import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
      settings={{
        // Find your environment id at https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/developer
        environmentId: "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-ID",
        walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors],
      }}
    >
      <DynamicWagmiConnector>
        <DynamicWidget />
      </DynamicWagmiConnector>
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
};
```

#### Create the SmartAccountClient

Create the smart account client using the Dynamic signer. Note: DynamicWagmiConnector internally sets up the WagmiConfig, so there is no need to do it separately. This is where you would configure what smart account implementation (e.g. [Safe](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-safe-account), [Kernel](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-kernel-account), Biconomy, [TrustWallet](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-trustwallet-account) [SimpleAccount](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-simple-account)) and what paymaster logic you want to use.

```ts
import { createSmartAccountClient } from "permissionless";
import { toSimpleSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts";
import { useWalletClient } from "wagmi";
import { createPublicClient, http, zeroAddress } from "viem";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";
import { createPimlicoClient } from "permissionless/clients/pimlico"
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"

const {
  data: walletClient
} = useWalletClient()

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: sepolia, // or whatever chain you are using
  transport: http()
})

const pimlicoUrl = `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=<PIMLICO_API_KEY>`

const pimlicoClient = createPimlicoClient({
    transport: http(pimlicoUrl),
    entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7",
    }
})

const simpleSmartAccount = await toSimpleSmartAccount({
  owner: walletClient,
  client: publicClient,
  entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7"
    }
})

const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
  account: simpleSmartAccount,
  chain: sepolia,
  bundlerTransport: http(pimlicoUrl),
  paymaster: pimlicoClient,
  userOperation: {
    estimateFeesPerGas: async () => {
      return (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast
    },
  }
})
```

#### Send a transaction

You can now send transactions as normal. The `sponsorUserOperation` function will be called before each transaction is signed and sent, applying the custom paymaster logic you have set.

```ts
const txHash = await smartAccountClient.sendTransaction({
    to: zeroAddress,
    data: "0x",
    value: BigInt(0)
})
```

## How to use a Fireblocks signer with permissionless.js

[Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/) is a user-friendly platform designed for building blockchain-based products and managing digital asset operations. It uses a direct custody approach, combining high performance with zero counterparty risk and multi-layered security. The platform includes secure MPC-based digital asset wallets, a policy engine for governance and transaction rules, and comprehensive treasury management. Fireblocks' security framework features multiple layers, including MPC-CMP technology, secure enclaves, and a robust policy engine, ensuring protection against cyberattacks, internal threats, and human errors. It's widely used for various operations like treasury, trading, and managing NFTs, smart contracts, and user wallets.

### Setup

To use Fireblocks with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Fireblocks.

* Refer to the [Fireblocks documentation site](https://developers.fireblocks.com/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Fireblocks.
* For a quick start, Fireblocks provides a guide, available [here](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/quickstart).

### Integration

Integrating permissionless.js with Fireblocks is straightforward after setting up the project. Fireblocks provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

#### Create the Fireblocks object

After following the Fireblocks documentation, you will have access to a `FireblocksWeb3Provider` object as shown that you can pass as an owner to `createeSmartAccountClient`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/signers/fireblocks.ts:main]
```

#### Use with permissionless.js

<SmartAccounts />


## Signers for permissionless.js

Smart accounts are able to define custom authentication and authorization schemes, but still require signatures to validate user operations coming from signers. permissionless.js which accepts `LocalAccount | EIP1193Provider | WalletClient`, that can be passed as an owner to `createSmartAccountClient`. While by default these owners have full control over the smart account, it's possible to define custom roles and permissions for owners, and mix-and-match them to create complex multi-signature schemes, as well as rotate signers and revoke their access.

In addition to pure EOA owners, permissionless.js supports a variety of third-party wallet services as owners for smart accounts.  This allows you to leverage the UIs and infrastructure of these services, while still using smart accounts supported by permissionless.js.

const authResponse = await stytchClient.otps.authenticate({
    method_id: stytchResponse.email_id,
    code: otpResponse.code,
    session_duration_minutes: 60 * 24 * 7,
})

const sessionStatus = await stytchClient.sessions.authenticate({
    session_token: authResponse.session_token,
})
```

```ts [SMS]
const authResponse = await stytchClient.otps.authenticate({
    method_id: stytchResponse.phone_id,
    code: otpResponse.code,
    session_duration_minutes: 60 * 24 * 7,
})

const sessionStatus = await stytchClient.sessions.authenticate({
    session_token: authResponse.session_token,
})
```

```ts [WhatsApp]
const authResponse = await stytchClient.otps.authenticate({
    method_id: stytchResponse.phone_id,
    code: otpResponse.code,
    session_duration_minutes: 60 * 24 * 7,
})

const sessionStatus = await stytchClient.sessions.authenticate({
    session_token: authResponse.session_token,
})
```
:::

#### Get a Lit Relay Server API Key

You can get a Lit Relay Server API Key by filling out [the Lit Protocol team's form](https://forms.gle/RNZYtGYTY9BcD9MEA)

#### Mint a PKPs through Lit Protocol

```ts
const litClient = new LitAuthClient({
    litRelayConfig: {
        relayApiKey: '<Your Lit Relay Server API Key from the previous step>',
    }
});

const session = litClient.initProvider(ProviderType.StytchOtp, {
    userId: sessionStatus.session.user_id,
    appId: "project-test-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
})

const authMethod = await session.authenticate({ 
    accessToken: sessionStatus.session_jwt 
})

await session.mintPKPThroughRelayer(authMethod)
const pkps = await session.fetchPKPsThroughRelayer(authMethod)
```

#### Generate the Controller Session Signatures

```ts
const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClientNodeJs({
    litNetwork: 'serrano',
    debug: false,
})
await litNodeClient.connect();

const resourceAbilities = [
    {
        resource: new LitActionResource("*"),
        ability: LitAbility.PKPSigning,
    },
];

const sessionKeyPair = litNodeClient.getSessionKey();

const authNeededCallback = async (params: AuthCallbackParams) => {
    const response = await litNodeClient.signSessionKey({
        sessionKey: sessionKeyPair,
        statement: params.statement,
        authMethods: [authMethod],
        pkpPublicKey: pkp[pkp.length - 1].publicKey,
        expiration: params.expiration,
        resources: params.resources,
        chainId: 1,
    });
    return response.authSig;
};

const sessionSigs = await litNodeClient.getSessionSigs({
    chain: "ethereum",
    expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7).toISOString(),
    resourceAbilityRequests: resourceAbilities,
    sessionKey: sessionKeyPair,
    authNeededCallback    
}).catch((err) => {
    console.log("error while attempting to access session signatures: ", err)
    throw err;
});
```

#### Initialize the PKP Wallet

We will now generate a wallet that can act a regular Ethers.js wallet, but will use the PKPs minted through Lit Protocol to sign transactions under the hood.

```ts
const pkpWallet = new PKPEthersWallet({
    pkpPubKey: pkp[pkp.length - 1].publicKey,
    rpc: "<standard RPC URL for the chain you are using>", // e.g. https://sepolia.rpc.thirdweb.com
    controllerSessionSigs: sessionSigs
});

await pkpWallet.init();
```

#### Use the PKP Wallet to sign user operations and send them through Pimlico

You can now use the `pkpWallet` as a regular Ethers.js wallet to sign user operations. To submit a user operation to Pimlico, you can follow the steps to [sponsor a user operation with Pimlico's verifying paymaster](/infra/paymaster/verifying-paymaster/usage) and/or [submit a user operation through Pimlico's bundler](/infra/bundler/usage). If you would like to integrate Lit Protocol with the full flow of generating, signing, and submitting a user operation, you can follow the steps in [tutorial 1](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1), replacing the signing step with the PKP wallet and using `pkpWallet.address` as the owner address of the smart account.

Modified from [tutorial 1](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1), an example of how to use the PKP wallet to sign a user operation is shown below:

```typescript
const signature = await pkpWallet.signMessage(
    ethers.utils.arrayify(await entryPoint.getUserOpHash(userOperation)),
)

userOperation.signature = signature
```

And an example of how you would generate the initCode for a SimpleAccount using the PKP wallet is shown below:

```typescript
const initCode = ethers.utils.hexConcat([
    SIMPLE_ACCOUNT_FACTORY_ADDRESS,
    simpleAccountFactory.interface.encodeFunctionData("createAccount", [pkpWallet.address, 0]),
])
```

npm install viem ox permissionless
```

#### Create a passkeys client

You will need to create a passkeys client to interact with the passkeys server. Learn how to create your own or use passkeys server at [How to create a Passkey (WebAuthn) server](/permissionless/how-to/signers/passkey-server#how-to-create-a-passkey-webauthn-server).

If you want to use Pimlico's passkeys server, visit [Dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/passkey-server) and configure your passkeys server.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NNtt8kY.png)

You will then create a passkeys client with the following code:

```ts
const passkeyServerClient = createPasskeyServerClient({
    chain,
    transport: http(
        `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/${chain.id}/rpc?apikey=${pimlicoApiKey}`
    )
})
```

#### Create credentials

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import {
    createWebAuthnCredential,
} from "viem/account-abstraction"

export function PasskeysDemo() {
    const [credential, setCredential] = useState<P256Credential>()

    const createCredential = async () => { // [!code focus]
        const credential = await createWebAuthnCredential( // [!code focus]
            // Start the registration process // [!code focus]
            await passkeyServerClient.startRegistration({ // [!code focus]
                context: { // [!code focus]
                    // userName that will be shown to the user when creating the passkey // [!code focus]

### How to create a Passkey (WebAuthn) server

This guide will walk you through the steps to create your own Passkey (WebAuthn) server.

::::steps
#### Install the required packages

```bash
npm install @simplewebauthn/server @levischuck/tiny-cbor fastify @fastify/cors zod
```

:::info
This guide will use the `fastify` framework to create the passkeys server. You can choose to use any other framework to serve the API.
:::

#### Create a server

## How to use a Passkey (WebAuthn) signer

This how-to guide will walk you through the steps to integrate Passkey (WebAuthn) signer with a smart account whose user operations are relayed and sponsored by Pimlico.

:::info
Passkey (WebAuthn) is a modern authentication method that allows users to sign in to websites and apps using their fingerprint, face, or other biometric information. For more information on how Passkey works, visit [the documentation page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API).
:::

### Steps

::::steps
#### Install the required packages

```bash
npm install viem permissionless
```

#### Create credentials

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import {
    createWebAuthnCredential,
} from "viem/account-abstraction"

export function PasskeysDemo() {
    const [credential, setCredential] = useState<P256Credential>(() =>
        JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("credential"))
    )

    const createCredential = async () => {
        const credential = await createWebAuthnCredential({
            name: "Wallet"
        })
        localStorage.setItem("credential", JSON.stringify(credential))
        setCredential(credential)
    }

    if (!credential)
        return (
            <button type="button" onClick={createCredential}>
                Create credential
            </button>
        )

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Credential: {credential.id}</p>
        </div>
    )
}
```

:::warning
We suggest using a passkeys server to share the same credential across multiple devices easily.
Checkout the guide to use your own or Pimlico's passkeys server at [How to use a Passkey (WebAuthn) server](https://docs.pimlico.io/docs/sdk/advanced/passkeys).
To learn how to set up a passkeys server with [simplewebauthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/docs/packages/server), check out their guide.
Zerodev also provides a [passkeys server](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/advanced/passkeys#setting-up-passkey-server) that you can use.

## How to use a Privy signer with permissionless.js

permissionless.js allows you to plug in custom signers to control the accounts that you create. Privy is an embedded wallet provider that allows you to easily onboard users to your dapp. It is possible to use Privy as a signer with permissionless.js, allowing you to use Privy to create and control smart accounts and sign transactions.

Additionally you may want to look at Privy's guide on working with permissionless.js [here](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/recipes/account-abstraction/pimlico).

:::steps
#### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm i @privy-io/react-auth @privy-io/wagmi-connector permissionless viem wagmi
```

#### Create the Privy provider

Following Privy's [quickstart guide](https://docs.privy.io/guide/quickstart), set up the Privy provider in your app. Also integrate the PrivyWagmiConnector, which will allow you to use Privy as a signer with permissionless.js.

```ts
import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth';
import { PrivyWagmiConnector } from '@privy-io/wagmi-connector';

<PrivyProvider
  appId={"<Privy-App-Id>"}
  config={{
    embeddedWallets: {
      createOnLogin: "all-users",
    },
  }}
>
    <PrivyWagmiConnector wagmiChainsConfig={configureChainsConfig}>
        {children}
    </PrivyWagmiConnector>
</PrivyProvider>;

```

#### Set Privy as the active wallet

In your app, set Privy's embedded wallet as the active wallet for wagmi

```ts
import { useWallets } from "@privy-io/react-auth";
import { usePrivyWagmi } from "@privy-io/wagmi-connector";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const { wallets } = useWallets();
const embeddedWallet = wallets.find(
  (wallet) => wallet.walletClientType === "privy"
);
```

#### Create the SmartAccountClient

Create the smart account client using the Privy signer. This is where you would configure what smart account implementation (e.g. [Safe](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-safe-account), [Kernel](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-kernel-account), Biconomy, [TrustWallet](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-trustwallet-account), [SimpleAccount](/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-simple-account)) and what paymaster logic you want to use.

```ts
import { createSmartAccountClient } from "permissionless";
import { toSimpleSmartAccount } from "permissionless/accounts";
import { useWalletClient } from "wagmi";
import { createPublicClient, http, zeroAddress } from "viem";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";
import { createPimlicoClient } from "permissionless/clients/pimlico"
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"

const {
  data: walletClient
} = useWalletClient()

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: sepolia, // or whatever chain you are using
  transport: http()
})

const pimlicoUrl = `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=<PIMLICO_API_KEY>`

const pimlicoClient = createPimlicoClient({
    transport: http(pimlicoUrl),
    entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7",
    }
})

const owner = embeddedWallet.getEthereumProvider()

if (!owner) {
  throw new Error("No owner found")
}

const simpleSmartAccount = await toSimpleSmartAccount({
  owner: owner,
  client: publicClient,
  entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7"
    }
})

const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
  account: simpleSmartAccount,
  chain: sepolia,
  bundlerTransport: http(pimlicoUrl),
  paymaster: pimlicoClient,
  userOperation: {
    estimateFeesPerGas: async () => {
      return (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast
    },
  }
})
```

#### Send a transaction

You can now send transactions as normal. The `sponsorUserOperation` function will be called before each transaction is signed and sent, applying the custom paymaster logic you have set.

```ts
const txHash = await smartAccountClient.sendTransaction({
    to: zeroAddress,
    data: "0x",
    value: BigInt(0)
})
```

## How to use a Turnkey signer with permissionless.js

[Turnkey](https://turnkey.com/) is a key infrastructure provider with a great developer API and a powerful security policy engine.

By combining permissionless.js with Turnkey, you can create **custodial AA wallets** whose security is provided by Turnkey, with powerful functionalities such as sponsoring gas, batching transactions, etc.

### Setup

To use Turnkey with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Turnkey.

* Refer to the [Turnkey documentation site](https://docs.turnkey.com/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Turnkey.
* For a quick start, Turnkey provides examples, available [here](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/examples).

### Integration

Integrating permissionless.js with Turnkey is straightforward after setting up the project. Turnkey provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

#### Create the TurnkeyClient and a Turnkey viem account

After following the Turnkey documentation, you will have access to a `TurnkeyClient`. An example is shown below that you can pass as an owner to `createeSmartAccountClient`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/signers/turnkey.ts:main]
```

#### Use with permissionless.js

import SmartAccounts from "./smartAccounts.mdx"

<SmartAccounts />


## How to use a Web3Auth signer with permissionless.js

[Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/) is a popular embedded wallet provider that supports social logins. While social logins are great, your users still need to onramp in order to pay for gas, which introduces significant friction.

By combining permissionless.js with Web3Auth, you can use Web3Auth to enable a smooth social login experience, while using permissionless.js accounts as the smart wallets to sponsor gas for users, batch transactions, and more.

### Setup

To use Web3Auth with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Web3Auth.

* Refer to the [Web3Auth documentation site](https://web3auth.io/docs/index.html) for instructions on setting up an application with the Web3Auth.
* For a quick start, Web3Auth provides example starter projects, available [here](https://web3auth.io/docs/examples?product=Plug+and+Play\&sdk=Plug+and+Play+Web+Modal+SDK).

### Integration

Integrating permissionless.js with Web3Auth is straightforward after setting up the project. Web3Auth provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

#### Create the Web3Auth object

After following the Web3Auth documentation, you will have access to a `web3auth` object as shown below that you can pass as an owner to `createeSmartAccountClient`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/signers/web3auth.ts:main]
```

#### Use with permissionless.js

import SmartAccounts from "./smartAccounts.mdx"

<SmartAccounts />

For a full example, see the [example permissionless + Web3Auth app](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/web3auth-demo/blob/main/src/components/web3auth/web3auth.tsx).


## Testing with BuildBear Sandboxes

This guide introduces how to setup a BuildBear Sandbox with for testing the Alto bundler and a mock paymaster. We will be using viem and permissionless to interact with the sandbox enviornment.

### Overview

BuildBear provides on-demand, isolated test environments that clone existing blockchain networks. These environments are perfect for testing account abstraction implementations as they:

* Provide a persistent, dedicated testnet environment
* Support EIP-4337 and all necessary AA infrastructure
* Allow you to fork from existing networks (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.)
* Unlocked faucets for testing
* Offer an explorer interface for easy debugging

### Steps

::::steps
#### Creating and setting up a BuildBear Sandbox

1. Go to [buildbear.io](https://www.buildbear.io) and sign up for an account if you don't have one already.

2. Create a new Sandbox by clicking "Create a Sandbox" and selecting the network you want to fork (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia, etc.).

3. Navigate to the Plugin tab on your sandbox dashboard and install the Pimlico Plugin. Ensure the plugin appears as installed in the marketplace or Installed tab.

4. Go to your Buildbear sandbox dashboard and locate the RPC URL. Copy the RPC URL, which also serves as the Pimlico Client API endpoint. It should look something like the below.
   * BuildBear Sandbox RPC URL: `https://rpc.buildbear.io/<YOUR-SANDBOX-ID>`
   * Pimlico Client API: `https://rpc.buildbear.io/<YOUR-SANDBOX-ID>`

5. Once your Sandbox is created, you'll get access to:
   * RPC URL
   * Chain ID
   * Explorer URL
   * Faucet to fund your test accounts

#### Setup the clients

```ts [Setup Clients]
// [!include ~/snippets/testing/build-bear.ts:clients]
```

#### Setup the Smart Account Client

```ts [Setup Clients]
// [!include ~/snippets/testing/build-bear.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

#### Funding your smart account (Optional)

If you want to fund your smart account with native currency or ERC-20 tokens, you can use the following curl commands:

Funding native currency:

```
curl -X POST https://rpc.buildbear.io/<YOUR-SANDBOX-ID>  \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "buildbear_nativeFaucet",
    "params": [{
      "address": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
      "balance": "100"
    }]
  }'
```

Funding ERC-20 tokens:

```
curl -X POST https://rpc.buildbear.io/<YOUR-SANDBOX-ID> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "buildbear_ERC20Faucet",
    "params": [{
      "address": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
      "balance": "100",
      "token": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
    }]
  }'
```

#### Sending a userOperation

:::code-group
```ts [Verifying Paymaster]
// [!include ~/snippets/testing/build-bear.ts:verifyingPaymaster]
```

```ts [ERC-20 Paymaster]
// [!include ~/snippets/testing/build-bear.ts:erc20Paymaster]
```
:::

:::info
paymaster top-ups are taken care of by the sandbox and you do need to worry about topping up the paymaster ever

## Local Testing With Docker

This guide introduces a ready-to-use mock test environment, that contains:

* A local Alto bundler
* A mock verifying paymaster
* An Anvil node
* ERC-4337 related contracts, including the EntryPoint and account factories for all major smart account implementations.

The test environment is orchestrated using **docker compose**. Where the docker containers are pulled from [this repo](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/mock-aa-environment).

The mock environment is designed to mimic mainnet as closely as possible by building with the latest Alto version and by deploying all contracts (entrypoints, paymasters, smart account factories, etc.)

This has advantages over testing against a production testnet as you have more control over the testing environment and can make use of features like anvil cheatcodes.

### Steps

::::steps
#### Setup

To get started, create a **alto-config.json** file at the root of your test directory with the following contents.

```json [alto-config.json]
{
	"network-name": "local",
	"log-environment": "production",
	"entrypoints": "0x5ff137d4b0fdcd49dca30c7cf57e578a026d2789,0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032",
	"balance-override-enabled": "true",
	"api-version": "v1,v2",
	"rpc-url": "http://anvil:8545",
	"min-balance": "0",
	"utility-private-key": "0xdbda1821b80551c9d65939329250298aa3472ba22feea921c0cf5d620ea67b97",
	"executor-private-keys": "0x2a871d0798f97d79848a013d4936a73bf4cc922c825d33c1cf7073dff6d409c6,0x4bbbf85ce3377467afe5d46f804f221813b2bb87f24d81f60f1fcdbf7cbf4356,0x92db14e403b83dfe3df233f83dfa3a0d7096f21ca9b0d6d6b8d88b2b4ec1564e,0x8b3a350cf5c34c9194ca85829a2df0ec3153be0318b5e2d3348e872092edffba,0x47e179ec197488593b187f80a00eb0da91f1b9d0b13f8733639f19c30a34926a",
	"max-block-range": 10000,
	"safe-mode": false,
	"port": 4337,
	"log-level": "info",
	"public-client-log-level": "error",
	"wallet-client-log-level": "error",
	"polling-interval": 100
}
```

> Note: All private keys are test keys generated by anvil

Then, create a **docker-compose.yaml** file at the root of your test directory with the following contents.

```yaml [docker-compose.yaml]
services:
  anvil:
    image: ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:nightly-c4a984fbf2c48b793c8cd53af84f56009dd1070c
    ports: [ "8545:8545" ]
    entrypoint: [ "anvil", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--block-time", "0.1", "--silent"]
    platform: linux/amd64/v8
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "cast rpc web3_clientVersion | grep -c anvil > /dev/null "]
      start_interval: 250ms
      start_period: 10s
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 50

  contract-deployer:
    image: ghcr.io/pimlicolabs/mock-contract-deployer:main
    environment:
      - ANVIL_RPC=http://anvil:8545
    depends_on:
      anvil:
        condition: service_healthy

  mock-paymaster:
    image: ghcr.io/pimlicolabs/mock-verifying-paymaster:main
    ports: [ "3000:3000" ]
    environment:
      - ALTO_RPC=http://alto:4337
      - ANVIL_RPC=http://anvil:8545
    depends_on:
      anvil:
        condition: service_healthy
      contract-deployer:
        condition: service_completed_successfully

  alto:
    image: ghcr.io/pimlicolabs/alto:latest
    ports: [ "4337:4337" ]
    entrypoint: ["node", "src/lib/cli/alto.js", "run", "--config", "/app/alto-config.json"]
    depends_on:
      anvil:
        condition: service_healthy
      contract-deployer:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
    volumes:
      - ./alto-config.json:/app/alto-config.json
```

To start the test environment, run

```sh
docker compose up
```

Once docker has started, the following services can be accessed locally through the following endpoints:

* `Anvil` at **localhost:8545**
* `Alto Bundler` at **localhost:4337**
* `Mock Paymaster` at **localhost:3000**

You can now use permissionless like you normally would but instead of referencing the live endpoints, use the local endpoints mentioned above when creating the clients.

```ts [clients.ts] twoslash
import { createPimlicoClient } from "permissionless/clients/pimlico";
import { http, createPublicClient } from "viem";
import { createBundlerClient, entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"
import { foundry } from "viem/chains";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: foundry,
  transport: http("http://localhost:8545"), // [!code ++]
});

const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
  chain: foundry,
  transport: http("http://localhost:4337") // [!code ++]
});

const pimlicoClient = createPimlicoClient({
    transport: http("http://localhost:3000"),  // [!code ++]
    entryPoint: {
        address: entryPoint07Address,
        version: "0.7",
    }
})
```

:::info
Note: All smart account types supported by permissionless.js will work out of the box as all related factories and modules are deployed on the local anvil instance.
:::

#### Vitest Integration

You can add scripts in your **package.json** to automatically set up and tear down your mock environment when running tests.

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "aa-tests",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "bun run docker:up && vitest run && bun run docker:down",
    "docker:up": "docker-compose up -d", // [!code ++]
    "docker:down": "docker-compose down" // [!code ++]
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "viem": "^2.9.17",
    "permissionless": "^0.1.35"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^1.5.2"
  }
}
```

When writing test cases, ensure that the bundler and paymaster are fully setup before sending any request to them. To do this, make a simple health check in the `beforeAll` declaration.

:::code-group
```ts [basic.test.ts]
import { beforeAll, describe, expect, test } from "vitest";
import { ensureBundlerIsReady, ensurePaymasterIsReady } from "./healthCheck";
import { foundry } from "viem/chains";
import { http } from "viem";
import {
  createBundlerClient,
  entryPoint06Address,
  entryPoint07Address
} from "viem/account-abstraction";

describe("Test basic bundler functions", () => {
  beforeAll(async () => { // [!code ++]
    await ensureBundlerIsReady(); // [!code ++]
    await ensurePaymasterIsReady(); // [!code ++]
  }); // [!code ++]

  test("Can get chainId", async () => {
    const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
      chain: foundry,
      transport: http("http://localhost:4337"),
    });

    const chainId = await bundlerClient.getChainId();

    expect(chainId).toEqual(foundry.id);
  });

  test("Can get supported entryPoints", async () => {
    const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
      chain: foundry,
      transport: http("http://localhost:4337"),
    });

    const supportedEntryPoints = await bundlerClient.getSupportedEntryPoints();

    expect(supportedEntryPoints).toEqual([
      entryPoint06Address,
      entryPoint07Address,
    ]);
  });
});
```

```ts [healthCheck.ts] twoslash
import { createBundlerClient } from "viem/account-abstraction";
import { http } from "viem";
import { foundry } from "viem/chains";

export const ensureBundlerIsReady = async () => {
  const bundlerClient = createBundlerClient({
    chain: foundry,
    transport: http("http://localhost:4337"),
  });

  while (true) {
    try {
      await bundlerClient.getChainId();
      return;
    } catch {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
  }
};

export const ensurePaymasterIsReady = async () => {
  while (true) {
    try {
      // mock paymaster will open up this endpoint when ready
      const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/ping`);
      const data = await res.json();
      if (data.message !== "pong") {
        throw new Error("paymaster not ready yet");
      }

      return;
    } catch {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
  }
};
```
:::

#### Extension: Testing against forked state

If you want your tests to run against a live blockchain, you can slightly edit the **docker-compose.yaml** file to fork from the latest block by adding the anvil flag **--fork-url** and the environment variable **SKIP\_DEPLOYMENTS** to skip the local contract deployments.

```yaml [docker-compose.yaml]

## Pimlico Client

A Pimlico Bundler Client is an interface to official ERC-4337 & ERC-7677 JSON-RPC API methods that include sending user operations, estimation user operation gas limits, getting user operation receipts, supporting paymaster rpc methods and more as well as the Pimlico-specific bundler methods [pimlico\_getUserOperationStatus](/infra/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationStatus) and [pimlico\_getUserOperationGasPrice](/infra/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice).

To create a Pimlico Client, you can use the `createPimlicoClient` method.

### Import

```ts twoslash
import { createPimlicoClient } from 'permissionless/clients/pimlico'
```

### Usage

Initialize th client with your desired Chain (e.g. mainnet) and Transport (e.g. http) from viem. Pimlico client will by default have bundler actions, paymaster actions and custom pimlico actions.

```ts twoslash
import { http } from 'viem'
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
import { createPimlicoClient } from 'permissionless/clients/pimlico'
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"

const pimlicoClient = createPimlicoClient({ 
  transport: http("https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"),
  entryPoint: {
    address: entryPoint07Address,
    version: "0.7",
  }
})
```

Then you can consume Pimlico Bundler Actions:

```ts
const userOperationGasPrice = await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()
```

Alternatively, you can create a barebon client and extend pimlico specific actions:

```ts twoslash
import { http, createClient } from 'viem'
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
import { pimlicoActions } from "permissionless/actions/pimlico";
import { bundlerActions, paymasterActions, entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction";

const client = createClient({
    chain: sepolia,
    transport: http("https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"),
})
    .extend(bundlerActions)
    .extend(paymasterActions)
    .extend(
        pimlicoActions({
            entryPoint: {
                address: entryPoint07Address,
                version: "0.7",
            }
        })
    )
```


## Smart Account Client

A Smart Account Client is an almost drop-in replacement for a standard viem [walletClient](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet) but for managing smart accounts instead of EOA accounts. In addition, a Smart Account Client also contains, depending on the underlying smart account implementation used, a few extra actions that are specific to smart accounts.

To create a Smart Account Client, use the `createSmartAccountClient` function.

### Import

```ts twoslash
import { createSmartAccountClient } from 'permissionless'
```

### Usage

Initialize a Smart Account Client with your desired account (which can be created using a function like `toSimpleSmartAccount`), chain, bundler transport, and optionally a sponsorUserOperation middleware by using the `createSmartAccountClient` method:

```ts
import {  http } from "viem"
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains"
import { createSmartAccountClient } from "permissionless"
import { simpleSmartAccount } from "./simpleSmartAccount"; // created elsewhere
import { pimlicoClient } from "./pimlicoClient"; // created elsewhere

const pimlicoBundlerUrl = `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=<PIMLICO_API_KEY>`

const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    account: simpleSmartAccount,
    chain: sepolia,
    bundlerTransport: http(pimlicoBundlerUrl),
    paymaster: pimlicoClient, // optional
    userOperation: {
        estimateFeesPerGas: async () => {
            return (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast // only when using pimlico bundler
        },
    }
})
```

Then you can consume Smart Account Actions and access properties:

```ts
const smartAccountAddress = await smartAccountClient.account.address
```


## accountId

```ts [example.ts]
import { pimlicoClient } from "./client"

const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    account,
    chain: sepolia,
    bundlerTransport: http(pimlicoUrl),
    paymaster: pimlicoClient,
    userOperation: {
        estimateFeesPerGas: async () => {
            return (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast
        },
    }
})

/* other gas alternatives */
const gasPriceResult = await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()
/**
 * {
    "slow": {
        "maxFeePerGas": 3267781404n,
        "maxPriorityFeePerGas": 3267781404n
    },
    "standard": {
        "maxFeePerGas": 3439769899n,

 * }
 */

```

```ts [client.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/pimlicoClient.ts:client]
```
:::

### Returns

* **Type:** `GetUserOperationStatusReturnType`

The status of the User Operation ("not\_found" | "not\_submitted" | "submitted" | "rejected" | "reverted" | "included" | "failed" | "queued") as well as the hash of the transaction being used to bundle the User Operation. If the hash is not known (for instance because the User Operation has not been submitted yet), the hash will be `null`.

### Parameters

#### hash

* **Type:** `Hash`

The hash of the User Operation.

### JSON-RPC Method

[`pimlico_getUserOperationStatus`](/infra/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationStatus)

        author: string | null
        icon: string | null
        description: string | null
    }
}[]
```

#### name (optional)

* **Type:** `string | null`

The name of the sponsorship policy.

#### author (optional)

* **Type:** `string | null`

The author of the sponsorship policy.

#### icon (optional)

* **Type:** `string | null`

The icon of the sponsorship policy. The icon must be a data URI as defined in RFC-2397.

### JSON-RPC Method

[`pm_validateSponsorshipPolicies`](/infra/paymaster/verifying-paymaster/endpoints)


## getAccountNonce

Returns the current nonce of the smart account for a specified key.

### Usage

:::code-group
```ts [example.ts]
import { publicClient } from "./client.ts"
import { getAccountNonce } from "permissionless"
import { entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"

const nonce = await getAccountNonce(publicClient, {
    address: "0x277F6C1D8d4faFA3d8DcC837489cd69d86c682BA",
    entryPointAddress: entryPoint07Address,
    key: 0n // optional
})
// 23n
```

```ts [client.ts]
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({ 
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/...")
})
```
:::

### Returns

* **Type:** `bigint`

The current nonce of the smart account for the specified key (both the key and the sequence concatenated together into one uint256).

### Parameters

#### address

* **Type:** `Address`

The address of the smart account.

#### entryPoint

* **Type:** `Address`

The entry point address.

#### key (optional)

* **Type:** `bigint`

The key of the nonce. Defaults to 0n.

Instead of sequential nonce, ERC-4337 implements a nonce mechanism that uses a single uint256 nonce value in the UserOperation, but treats it as two values, a 192-bit “key”, and a 64-bit “sequence”. These values are represented on-chain in the EntryPoint contract. For each key the sequence is validated and incremented sequentially and monotonically by the EntryPoint for each UserOperation, however a new key can be introduced with an arbitrary value at any point.


## getSenderAddress

Return a sender address corresponding to the initCode of the User Operation where the smart account will be deployed.

### Usage

:::code-group
```ts [example.ts]
import { publicClient } from "./client.ts"
import { getSenderAddress } from "permissionless"

const senderAddress = await getSenderAddress(publicClient, {
    factory: "0x91E60e0613810449d098b0b5Ec8b51A0FE8c8985",
    factoryData: "0x5fbfb9cf000000000000000000000000cafb211a4ea1290370d43732fed4da817a2e11ed0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    entryPointAddress: entryPoint07Address
})
// "0x0C123D90Da0a640fFE54a2359D159629065775C5"
```

```ts [client.ts]
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({ 
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/...")
})

### Usage

:::code-group
```ts [example.ts]
import { smartAccountClient, simpleSmartAccount } from "./smartAccountClient"
import { parseAbiItem, encodeFunctionData } from "viem"

const hash = await smartAccountClient.sendTransaction({
    to: "0x0488bEE1Ec682db0F0E74AB52faFdDdEf10Af123",
    data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: [parseAbiItem('function mint()')]
    }),
    value: 0n
})
```

```ts [smartAccountClient.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/smartAccountClient.ts:client]
```
:::

You could also use the `sendTransaction` method to send multiple transactions in a single batch like so:

```ts
const hash = await smartAccountClient.sendTransaction({
    calls: [
        {
            to: "0x0488bEE1Ec682db0F0E74AB52faFdDdEf10Af123",
            data: encodeFunctionData({
                abi: [parseAbiItem('function mint()')]
            }),
            value: 0n
        },
        {
            to: "0x3c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc",
            abi: [{"inputs":[],"name":"getLastGreeter","outputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"","type":"address"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"greet","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}],

A "write" function on a Solidity contract modifies the state of the blockchain.

### Usage

:::code-group
```ts [example.ts]
import { smartAccountClient } from "./smartAccountClient"
import { simpleAbi } from './abi'

const hash = await smartAccountClient.writeContract({
    address: '0xFBA3912Ca04dd458c843e2EE08967fC04f3579c2',
    abi: simpleAbi,
    functionName: 'mint',
})
```

```ts [smartAccountClient.ts]

## Check if an external account supports paymasters

If you have added support to sponsor transactions for external accounts using `@permissionless/wagmi`, you can use this guide to check if the external account supports ERC-7677 paymasters and display custom UI for your users.

### Steps

:::steps
#### Import useCapabilities

```tsx
import { useCapabilities } from 'wagmi/experimental'
```

#### Fetch the available capabilities

```tsx
import { useCapabilities } from 'wagmi/experimental'

function App() {
  const capabilities = useCapabilities()
}
```

#### Parse the capabilities for the currect chain

```tsx
import { useCapabilities } from 'wagmi/experimental'

function App() {
  const capabilities = useCapabilities()
  
  const account = useAccount() // [!code focus]
  const capabilitiesForChain = capabilities[account.chainId] // [!code focus]

}
```

#### Check if the paymaster service is supported

```tsx
import { useCapabilities } from 'wagmi/experimental'

function App() {
  const capabilities = useCapabilities()
  const account = useAccount()

  const capabilitiesForChain = capabilities[account.chainId]
  const paymasterServiceSupported = capabilitiesForChain?.paymasterService?.supported // [!code focus]
}
```

## Tutorials

Learning-oriented lessons that take you through a series of steps to complete a project. Most useful when you want to get started with Pimlico.

[Tutorial 1](/permissionless/wagmi/tutorial/tutorial-1) takes you through the journey of leveraging @permissionless/wagmi's high-level APIs to easily sponsor your first gasless transaction for an external smart account using 7677.


## Tutorial 1 — Send your first gasless transaction

In this tutorial, you will submit your first fully-gasless transaction from an external smart account.

You will set up the necessary @permissionless/wagmi' PermissionlessProvider, paymasterService, ask Pimlico's verifying paymaster to sponsor it, and then ask external smartAccount to submit it on-chain.

### Steps

::::steps
#### Get a Pimlico API key

To get started, please go to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and generate a Pimlico API key.

#### Create a wagmi app

For new projects, it is recommended to set up your Wagmi app using the create-wagmi command line interface (CLI). This will create a new Wagmi project using TypeScript and install the required dependencies.

:::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create wagmi
```

```bash [npm]
npm create wagmi@latest
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create wagmi
```

```bash [bun]
bun create wagmi
```
:::

Once the command runs, you'll see some prompts to complete. Make sure you select `React` as `@permissionless/wagmi` only supports React as of now.

After the prompts, create-wagmi will create a directory with your project name and install the required dependencies. Check out the README.md for further instructions (if required).

#### Install @permissionless/wagmi

:::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install @permissionless/wagmi
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @permissionless/wagmi
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install @permissionless/wagmi
```

```bash [bun]
bun install @permissionless/wagmi
```
:::

#### Create capabilities & config

Create capabilities for the chains that you would like to sponsor the transactions for the users.

```tsx
export const config = createConfig({
    chains: [baseSepolia],
    connectors: [
        // coinbase wallet is one of the smart accounts that supports ERC-7677
        coinbaseWallet({ appName: "Pimlico", preference: "smartWalletOnly" })
    ],
    transports: {
        [baseSepolia.id]: http("https://sepolia.base.org")
    }
})

const capabilities = {
  paymasterService: {
    [baseSepolia.id]: {
        url: `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/${baseSepolia.id}/rpc?apikey=${pimlicoApiKey}`
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, you can integrate any service provider that complies with the ERC-7677 standard. For demonstration purposes, we are using Pimlico as the paymaster service provider.

Ensure you configure the service for all the blockchain networks where you plan to sponsor transactions. We are showcasing sponsorship for baseSepolia.

#### Wrap App in Context Provider

Wrap your app in the `PermissionlessProvider` React Context Provider and pass the `capabilities` you created earlier.

:::code-group
```tsx [App.tsx]
import { WagmiProvider } from "wagmi"
import { baseSepolia } from "wagmi/chains"
import { PermissionlessProvider } from "@permissionless/wagmi" // [!code focus]
import { config, capabilities } from "./wagmi.ts" // [!code focus]

ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
  <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          <PermissionlessProvider // [!code focus]
              capabilities={capabilities} // [!code focus]
          > // [!code focus]
              {/** ... */}
          </PermissionlessProvider> // [!code focus]
      </QueryClientProvider>
  </WagmiProvider>
)
```

```tsx [wagmi.ts]
export const config = createConfig({
    chains: [baseSepolia],
    connectors: [
        // coinbase wallet is one of the smart accounts that supports ERC-7677
        coinbaseWallet({ appName: "Pimlico", preference: "smartWalletOnly" })
    ],
    transports: {
        [baseSepolia.id]: http("https://sepolia.base.org")
    }
})

export const capabilities = {
  paymasterService: {
    [baseSepolia.id]: {
        url: `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/${baseSepolia.id}/rpc?apikey=${pimlicoApiKey}`
    }
  }
}
```
:::

Check out the [PermissionlessProvider]() docs to learn more about React Context in @permissionless/wagmi.

#### Use @permissionless/wagmi

Now that everything is set up, every component inside the Permissionless Provider can use Permissionless React Hooks.

```tsx [App.tsx]
import { useSendTransaction, useWaitForTransactionReceipt } from "wagmi" // [!code --] // [!code focus]
import {  // [!code ++] // [!code focus]
    useSendTransaction,  // [!code ++] // [!code focus]
    useWaitForTransactionReceipt  // [!code ++] // [!code focus]
} from "@permissionless/wagmi"  // [!code ++] // [!code focus]

function App() {
  const {
    sendTransaction,
    data: transactionReference,
    isPending
  } = useSendTransaction()
  
  const { data: receipt, isPending: isReceiptPending } =
    useWaitForTransactionReceipt({
      id: transactionReference
    })

  const sendTransactionCallback = useCallback(async () => {
    console.log("Sending transaction...")
    sendTransaction({
      to: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045",
      data: "0x1234"
    })
  }, [sendTransaction])

  return (
    <div style={{ marginTop: 60 }}>
      <h2>Send test transaction</h2>

      {isPending && <div>Sending transaction...</div>}

      {transactionReference && (
        <div>Awaiting confirmation: {transactionReference}</div>
      )}

      {receipt && <div>{receipt.status}</div>}

      <button onClick={sendTransactionCallback} type="button">
        Send Transaction
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

As you notice, `@permissionless/wagmi` exposes the same api as `wagmi`. `@permissionless/wagmi` is a drop-in replacement for `wagmi` that provides the same functionality, but with the added benefit of being able to use sponsor transactions.

:::info
The above code will sponsor transactions only when the external account is a smart account and supports ERC-7677. If the external account doesn't have the capability, the transaction will be sent as a normal transaction.
:::
::::

To test the above code connect using Coinbase SmartAccount and try sending your first transaction. By sending this transaction, you will have:

* Made Pimlico's verifying paymaster sponsor the user operation's gas fees
* Executed a simple sponsored transaction to `vitalik.eth`'s address from the Coinbase SmartAccount

All in a couple lines of code.

Congratulations, you are now a pioneer of Account Abstraction! 🎉

Please [get in touch](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ) if you have any questions or if you'd like to share what you're building!

## How to calculate UserOperation's costs using the ERC-20 Paymaster

This guide will show you how to estimate your user operation's cost in denomination of the ERC-20 token as well as USD.

When using Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster, the `pimlico_getTokenQuotes` endpoint helps you calculate the cost of your userOperation. It returns values `exchangeRate` and `exchangeRateNativeToUsd`. These are useful for determining how much to approve upfront or for displaying the cost to your users.

### Steps

:::steps
#### Define imports and create the clients

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/calculate-costs.ts:clients]
```

#### Fetch quote info for a certain token

For this example, we will be fetching quote info for USDC on base.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/calculate-costs.ts:fetchQuotes]
```

#### Calculate your userOperation's max cost

To find your userOperation's max cost, we will need to sum up all it's gas values. This includes:

* `preVerificationGas`
* `verificationGasLimit`
* `callGasLimit`
* `paymasterVerificationGasLimit` (v0.7 only)
* `paymasterPostOpGasLimit` (v0.7 only)

Once the gas values are summed up, we multiply it by the maxFeePerGas to get the max cost for the userOperation.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/calculate-costs.ts:calculateMaxCost]
```

#### Calculate your userOperation's maxCost in denomination of the ERC-20 token

To find the cost of your userOperation in denomination of the ERC-20, you should use this formula. This is the same formula that the paymaster executes onchain, the source code can be found on the [singleton-paymaster repo.](https://github.com/pimlicolabs)

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/calculate-costs.ts:calculateCostInToken]
```

> Note: We divide by `BigInt(1e18)` (constant) due to the ether decimals being encoded into exchangeRate.

#### Calculate your userOperation's maxCost in denomination of USD

The exchangeRateNativeToUsd represents the exchange rate of the chain's native gas token to USD. The value is returned with 6 digits of precision, to calculate the USD cost in a human readable format, you first need to find it's raw value and then divide it by 10^6.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/calculate-costs.ts:calculateUsdCost]
```

## How to use the ERC-20 Paymaster without unlimited token approvals

This guide will show you how to use the `prepareUserOperationForErc20Paymaster` function in permissionless.

This function lets you approve only the required amount of tokens for your userOperation. The approval call will be injected into the userOperation's calldata before it is sent.

### Steps

:::steps
#### Define imports and create the clients

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/use-paymaster-without-unlimited-approval.ts:clients]
```

#### Add the `prepareUserOperationForErc20Paymaster` override to `createSmartAccountClient`

This override will replace viem's `prepareUserOperation` action.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/use-paymaster-without-unlimited-approval.ts:prepareUserOperation]
```

#### Call `sendTransaction`

Calling sendTransaction will now automatically approve the required amount of tokens for your userOperation.

If the sender has a sufficient existing approval, then the additional approval call will not be added to the calldata.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/use-paymaster-without-unlimited-approval.ts:sendOp]
```
:::


## How to use the ERC-20 Paymaster

When using Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster, the paymaster needs approval to spend funds on the payer's behalf. The amount to approve must be atleast equal to the userOperation's maxCost.

You can use the helper function below to get the required approval amount.

### Steps

:::steps
#### Define imports and create the clients

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/how-to.ts:clients]
```

#### Fetch your users' token holdings

For this example, we will assume that our user only holds USDC on Base Sepolia.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/how-to.ts:getUserTokens]
```

#### Call `pimlico_getTokenQuotes` and calculate the approval amount needed for your userOperation

After calling `pimlico_getTokenQuotes`, use the returned values to calculate the approval amount for a specific userOperation by calling using formula from the paymaster's `getCostInToken` function.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/how-to.ts:getTokenQuotes]
```

#### Reconstruct and send the userOperation

After finding the amount that we need to approve, we reconstruct the userOperation to include the token approval before sending it.

Ensure that the paymaster context includes a `token` field to inform the Pimlico endpoint to sponsor the userOperation using ERC-20 mode.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/how-to.ts:sendUserOperation]
```

:::note[Endpoints]
List all sponsorship policies:

[`GET /v2/account/sponsorship_policies`](/infra/platform/api/sponsorship-policies/list)

Retrieve a specific sponsorship policy:

[`GET /v2/account/sponsorship_policies/:id`](/infra/platform/api/sponsorship-policies/retrieve)

Create a new sponsorship policy:

[`POST /v2/account/sponsorship_policies`](/infra/platform/api/sponsorship-policies/create)

Update an existing sponsorship policy:

[`POST /v2/account/sponsorship_policies/:id`](/infra/platform/api/sponsorship-policies/update)
