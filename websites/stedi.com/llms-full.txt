# Accounts and billing
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/accounts-and-billing/index



Learn how to manage Stedi accounts, members, billing, and payments.

## Accounts

A Stedi account is a container for all of your Stedi activity and resources. Every account has a unique ID which you can find in the [Account profile](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/account-details). This ID is used to identify the account in the API and in the dashboard. It is also used in dashboard URLs, where it appears in the `account` URL parameter.

Accounts can have unlimited members, and members can be [assigned different roles](#assigning-member-roles) with different permissions.

It's possible to have multiple accounts, though using one account is recommended for most customers. If you need additional accounts, you can reach out to [support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) and we'll enable them for you. Note that accounts cannot be linked – all settings and membership are specific to a given account.

You cannot delete an account via the dashboard or the API. If you need to delete an account, first delete all data and resources in the account then [contact support](https://www.stedi.com/contact).

### Settings

To access your user account settings, click your user account icon in the top right of the app. You can set the Stedi app to **Light** or **Dark** mode and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your user account.

To access your Stedi account settings, click the account name and select **Account settings**. You can view the account name, account ID, and require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all account users.

### Inviting members

You can add members in [member settings](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/members). Each time you invite a member, they will receive an email with your invitation. Invitations do not expire, but can be revoked by any account admin at any time before acceptance.

### Removing members

Any account admin can remove other members from an account. Removed users will still retain their Stedi user credentials and access to other accounts of which they're a member.

### Assigning member roles

Admins can use role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access and modify resources in a Stedi account.

Admins can assign Stedi account members to one of four roles:

* **Admin:** These users can access and modify all resources within a Stedi account. This includes adding and removing members, assigning member roles, adding billing information, configuring settings, generating EDI files, and configuring resources.
* **Developer:** These users can access and configure all resources.
* **Operator:** These users can access and configure Partnerships, Guides, and Mappings. They can interact with developer resources, but cannot modify them.
  <Tip>
    Operator is the minimum required role for a user to interact with Stedi's
    Healthcare APIs and review transactions (such as completed eligibility
    checks) in the Stedi app.
  </Tip>
* **Read-only:** These users can view some account resources, but cannot modify them. For example, they can review processed transactions in Stedi's interface but cannot call the API.

To change a member's role:

1. Go to [member settings](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/members) in your account.
2. Click the pencil icon for a member, choose the appropriate **Role** from the list, and click **Update role**.

### Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

You can enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your user account. To enable MFA, click your user account icon in the top right of the app and then click **Enable MFA**.

You can also require **all** users to enable MFA before accessing a Stedi account. To enforce MFA for all users:

1. Click the account name.
2. Select **Account settings** and toggle MFA to **ON**.

The next time a user logs into the Stedi account, Stedi prompts them to set up their MFA token: [https://portal.stedi.com/auth/setup-mfa](https://portal.stedi.com/auth/setup-mfa)

<Warning>
  Once you enable MFA for a Stedi account, it cannot be disabled.
</Warning>

## Billing and payment

Each account will be invoiced monthly. To add or edit your payment details, go to your Stedi account, click the account name, and then click **Billing**. Charges will be billed to the credit card on file.


# Get Execution

    curl --request GET -L \
      --url https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/executions/{executionId} \
      --header "Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}" 
  ```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>

# Get Execution Input
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-executions-input

core get /executions/{executionId}/input
This endpoint retrieves an execution's input document before it passes through any translation and mappings.

There are no size restrictions on documents when fetching from this endpoint.

## Response

This endpoint returns a `302` Temporary redirect to the document download URL. Many HTTP clients will automatically follow this redirect, or have a simple follow redirects configuration to set. For example, the `-L` or `--location` flags in cURL requests will automatically follow the redirect.

In the event you cannot, or chose not to automatically follow the redirect, the body of the response contains a JSON object with a single key `documentDownloadUrl` which contains a temporary URL to download the document. This URL is available for 60 minutes.

<RequestExample>
  ```bash Request
    curl --request GET -L \
      --url https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/executions/{executionId}/input \
      --header "Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"

# Get Execution Metadata
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-executions-metadata

core get /executions/{executionId}/metadata
This endpoint retrieves an execution's metadata document.

There are no size restrictions on documents when fetching from this endpoint.

## Response

This endpoint returns a 302 Temporary redirect to the document download URL. Many HTTP clients will automatically follow this redirect, or have a simple follow redirects configuration to set. For example, using the `-L` or `--location` flag in cURL will automatically follow the redirect.

In the event you cannot, or chose not to automatically follow the redirect, the body of the response contains a JSON object with a single key `documentDownloadUrl` which contains a temporary URL to download the document. This URL is available for 60 minutes.

<RequestExample>
  ```bash Request
    curl --request GET -L \
      --url https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/executions/{executionId}/metadata \

# Poll Executions
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-pollingexecutions

core get /polling/executions
This endpoint is used to regularly poll for new executions that have been processed by Stedi.

You must define one of `startDateTime` or `pageToken` when making a request.

You may optionally define a `pageSize`. The minimum `pageSize` is 1, and the maximum `pageSize` is 1000. The default is 100.

`startDateTime` takes a string in ISO 8601 format. (ex: `2023-08-10T18:00:00Z`). 
`startDateTime` must be set to at least 1 minute in the past.

The results will contain executions that occurred after this `startDateTime`. Starting from the oldest to newest executions ordered by the `processedAt` field. Note, this is _exclusive_ of the `startDateTime`, a execution occuring at exactly `2023-08-10T18:00:00Z` for instance, would not be included. In addition, there is a 15 second window where newly created executions will not be included to account for any network latency or clock drifts within the systems to ensure you do not miss any executions.

Each request will _always_ return a `nextPageToken`, regardless of whether there are new executions or not.

We DO NOT recommend trying to roll your own polling strategy leveraging `startDateTime` only. There are edge cases around two executions occuring at the _exact_ same time and being on the edge of a pagination which could cause you to miss one due to the exclusive nature of `startDateTime`. We recommend using `pageToken`'s instead.

When making subsequent polling requests (not initiating with `startDateTime`), the `pageToken` can be used to continue iterating through pages of executions. Usage of the `pageToken` guaruntees you will not miss any executions on the stream. If at any point there are no more new executions in the `item` array, you will still receive a `nextPageToken`. Continue to use this token to poll for new executions. Once there are new executions, they will be returned in the `item` array.

`pageToken`'s you have retrieved can serve as checkpoints. They do not expire, and you can always start from that point in the execution stream again if you need to catch a system up or recover from a failure. Storing `pageToken`'s as part of your polling process is encouraged.

`pageToken`'s are unique per request, opaque, and should not be parsed or modified in any way. They are not guaranteed to be in any particular format, and may change in the future.

# Get Fragment Output
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-transaction-fragment-output

core get /transactions/{transactionId}/fragments/{fragmentIndex}/output
This endpoint retrieves a transaction fragment's output document after it has been translated.

There are no size restrictions on documents when fetching from this endpoint, however they are generally smaller and consumable because they are fragments.

## Response

This endpoint returns a `302` Temporary redirect to the document download URL. Many HTTP clients will automatically follow this redirect, or have a simple follow redirects configuration to set. For example, using the `-L` or `--location` flag in cURL will automatically follow the redirect.

In the event you cannot, or chose not to automatically follow the redirect, the body of the response contains a JSON object with a single key `documentDownloadUrl` which contains a temporary URL to download the document. This URL is available for 60 minutes.

# Get Transaction Input
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-transactions-input

core get /transactions/{transactionId}/input
This endpoint retrieves a transaction's input document before it passes through any translation and mappings.

There are no size restrictions on documents when fetching from this endpoint.

## Response

This endpoint returns a  `302` Temporary redirect to the document download URL. Many HTTP clients will automatically follow this redirect, or have a simple follow redirects configuration to set. For example, using the `-L` or `--location` flag in cURL will automatically follow the redirect.

In the event you cannot, or chose not to automatically follow the redirect, the body of the response contains a JSON object with a single key `documentDownloadUrl` which contains a temporary URL to download the document. This URL is available for 60 minutes.

This endpoint retrieves a transaction's output document after it has been translated.

There are no size restrictions on documents when fetching from this endpoint.

## Response

This endpoint returns a `302` Temporary redirect to the document download URL. Many HTTP clients will automatically follow this redirect, or have a simple follow redirects configuration to set. For example, using the `-L` or `--location` flag in cURL will automatically follow the redirect.

# Stage fragment
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/post-fragments

post /fragments/{fragmentGroupId}
This endpoint stages a fragment for outbound delivery.

You can optionally specify a [mapping](/edi-platform/mappings/index) to transform the fragment to Stedi's Guide JSON format. If you don't specify a mapping, the fragment must match the [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format for the specified guide.

[Fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) allow you to split large transactions into smaller chunks for easier processing. You can enable fragments for one repeated EDI segment in each transaction set and then split the transaction into chunks based on that segment. For example, if you enable fragments on the `LIN` loop in an 846 Inventory Inquiry/Advice, you can stage fragments containing batches of `LIN` loops. Later, when you call the Create Outbound Transaction endpoint, Stedi stitches the fragments together into a single transaction and delivers it to your trading partner.


# Stage transactions
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/stage-transactions

post /partnerships/{partnershipId}/transaction-groups/{transactionGroupId}/transactions/{transactionSettingId}
This endpoint stages a transaction for outbound delivery.

Stedi stores the transaction in the transaction group specified by the `transactionGroupId`. If a group with that ID does not exist, Stedi creates one.

When you're ready to send all of the transactions in the group, call the [Deliver Transaction Group](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transaction-group) endpoint with the `transactionGroupId` to generate and deliver a fully-formed EDI file to your trading partner.

## Transaction data

You provide transaction data in [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format. The transaction data must be \< 5MB.

All of the transactions you stage in a transaction group must use the same transaction settings. If you attempt to stage a transaction with different settings, Stedi returns an error.


# Map Transaction Output
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/get-map-transaction-output

mappings get /mappings/{id}/map-transaction-output/{transactionId}
Retrieve a mapped transaction's output document


<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

This endpoint returns the mapped output of a processed inbound transaction. You can use it to retrieve processed transaction data asynchronously.

## Response

The endpoint applies the specified mapping to the processed transaction and returns the fully mapped output.

This endpoint returns a 202 Accepted upon receiving the initial request and while the transaction's output is being mapped in the background. Once the mapping process completes, the endpoint returns a 302 Temporary redirect to the document download URL. Many HTTP clients will automatically follow this redirect, or have a simple follow redirects configuration to set. For instance in `curl` using the `-L` or `--location` flag will automatically follow the redirect.

In the event you cannot, or chose not to automatically follow the redirect, the body of the 302 response contains a JSON object with a key `documentDownloadUrl` which contains a temporary URL to download the document. This URL is good for 60 minutes.

## Size limits

The recommended maximum size of the transaction output document mapped with this endpoint is 150 MB in Guide JSON format (equivalent of approximately 15 MB in raw EDI).


# Retry events
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/post-events-retry

core post /events/{eventId}/retry
This endpoint retriggers the specified processing event.

The retriggered event has a new `eventId` and appears as a separate event record in the Stedi portal. For example, if you retry a `transaction.processed.v2` event, the app shows two `transaction.processed.v2` events for the file.

Retrying individual processing events can be helpful when testing your integration. For example, you can use this approach to retrigger [Destination webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/destinations/index) without needing to continually reprocess the same test file.

<RequestExample>
  ```bash Request
    curl --request POST -L \
      --url https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/events/e8b4ddc9-96df-5df0-488d-2b489b6a8c23/retry \
      --header "Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}" 
  ```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
  ```text Response 200

# Create Outbound Interchange
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/post-generate-edi

core post /x12/partnerships/{partnershipId}/generate-edi
This endpoint generates and delivers fully-formed EDI files to your trading partners.

When you call this endpoint, Stedi:

1. Generates a single EDI file containing all transactions according to the Stedi guide attached to each outbound transaction setting. This includes adding required envelope information (`ISA` and `GS` headers) and autogenerated control numbers.
2. Delivers the EDI file to your trading partner through the connection specified in the transaction settings.

## Transaction data

You must provide transaction data in [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format. The transaction data must be \< 5MB.

## Delivery attempts

Stedi attempts to deliver a file to all configured connections every 6 minutes for up to 3 total attempts. If it cannot deliver the file after the third attempt, it marks the file execution as `FAILED` and emits the [`file.failed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-failed). Stedi displays each delivery attempt and the failure details on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.

## Customize generated files

You can change the timezone, time format, character set (which characters are allowed), and filename for generated files. [Learn more](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi/index#timezone-and-time-format).

## Inbound processing

There is no equivalent endpoint for parsing EDI files into JSON. To parse inbound files, you or your partner can send EDI files to an SFTP/FTPS or AS2 [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/index), and Stedi sends the JSON payload to the configured [Destination webhook](/edi-platform/configure/destinations/index).


# Invoke Mapping
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/post-invoke-mapping

mappings post /mappings/{id}/map
Maps the provided JSON to a different shape according to the specified mapping definition.

<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.

# Deliver Transaction Group
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transaction-group

core post /partnerships/{partnershipId}/transaction-groups/{transactionGroupId}/generate-edi
This endpoint generates and delivers a fully-formed EDI file containing the staged transactions in the specified transaction group.

When you call this endpoint, Stedi:

1. Generates a single EDI file containing all transactions in the specified transaction group (`transactionGroupId`). This includes adding required envelope information (`ISA` and `GS` headers) and autogenerated control numbers.
2. Delivers the EDI file to your trading partner through the connection specified in the transaction settings.

<Warning>
  You can only call this endpoint with a given `transactionGroupId` once. Afterward, that transaction group is locked, and you must create a new transaction group to generate another file.
</Warning>

## Stage transactions

You can use the [Stage Transactions API](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/stage-transactions) to store one or more transactions in a transaction group on Stedi. When you're ready to send all of the transactions in the group, you can call this endpoint to generate and deliver an EDI file to your trading partner.

## Delivery attempts

Stedi attempts to deliver a file to all configured connections every 6 minutes for up to 3 total attempts. If it cannot deliver the file after the third attempt, it marks the file execution as `FAILED` and emits the [`file.failed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-failed). Stedi displays each delivery attempt and the failure details on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.

## Customize generated files

You can change the timezone, time format, character set (which characters are allowed), and filename for generated files. [Learn more](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi/index#timezone-and-time-format).

## Inbound processing

There is no equivalent endpoint for parsing EDI files into JSON. To parse inbound files, you or your partner can send EDI files to an SFTP/FTPS or AS2 [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/index), and Stedi sends the JSON payload to the configured [Destination webhook](/edi-platform/configure/destinations/index).

This endpoint generates and delivers a fully-formed EDI file for a given transaction group. Transactions are staged in a group using the `CreateTransactionGroup` endpoint. Once a file has been generated for a given transaction group, the group can no longer be used.


# Create Outbound Transaction
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions

post /partnerships/{partnershipId}/transactions/{transactionSettingId}
This endpoint generates and delivers fully-formed EDI files containing a single transaction. It is the simplest way to generate EDI with Stedi.

When you call the endpoint, Stedi:

1. Applies the mapping (if present) to the provided transaction data.
2. Adds [fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) from specified fragment groups (if present).
3. Generates an EDI file according to the Stedi guide attached to the [outbound transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings#create-transaction-settings). This includes adding required envelope information (`ISA` and `GS` headers) and autogenerated control numbers.
4. Delivers the EDI file to your trading partner through the [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/index) specified in the outbound transaction setting.

<Tip>
  Visit [Generate EDI](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi/index) for
  step-by-step instructions to format transaction data and make requests.
</Tip>

## Response

When you deliver a single transaction without any fragment groups, this endpoint is synchronous, and you will receive any errors. If you are using more advanced features, generation may be asynchronous. In both cases, you can use the returned `fileExecutionId` to check the status of the delivery and retrieve the execution input, output, and metadata for the generated file.

## Transaction data

The endpoint supports three ways to provide transaction data:

* **No mapping or fragments**: You provide transaction data in [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format. The transaction data must be \< 5MB.
* **Mapping**: You provide transaction data in the source schema format for the specified [Stedi mapping](/edi-platform/mappings/index). The transaction data that you want to map must be \< 4MB.
* **Fragments**: You provide the fragment wrapper in [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format. Visit [outbound fragments](/edi-platform/fragments/outbound-fragments) for more details and examples.

## Delivery attempts

Stedi attempts to deliver a file to all configured connections every 6 minutes for up to 3 total attempts. If it cannot deliver the file after the third attempt, it marks the file execution as `FAILED` and emits the [`file.failed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-failed). Stedi displays each delivery attempt and the failure details on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.

## Customize generated files

You can change the timezone, time format, character set (which characters are allowed), and filename for generated files. [Learn more](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi/index#timezone-and-time-format).

## Inbound processing

There is no equivalent endpoint for parsing EDI files into JSON. To parse inbound files, you or your partner can send EDI files to an SFTP/FTPS or AS2 [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/index), and Stedi sends the JSON payload to the configured [Destination webhook](/edi-platform/configure/destinations/index).

This endpoint returns only the provider record; it doesn't include information about associated enrollments. To retrieve enrollment information, use the [List Enrollments](/api-reference/healthcare/get-enrollment-list-enrollments) endpoint.


# Provider
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-enrollment-provider

enrollment get /providers/{providerId}

<Warning>This is a **beta** endpoint. We may make backwards incompatible changes.</Warning>

This endpoint allows you to retrieve details for the specified provider.


# Poll Batch Eligibility Checks
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-polling-eligibility

manager get /eligibility-manager/polling/batch-eligibility

This endpoint retrieves the results of asynchronous eligibility checks you submitted through the asynchronous [Batch Eligibility Checks](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-batch-eligibility) endpoint. It doesn't return results for real-time eligibility checks.

The response only includes completed checks, so a single polling attempt may not retrieve responses for all checks within the batch, especially if you poll soon after initial submission. Stedi retries checks that fail due to payer processing issues for up to 8 hours.

## Filter results

You can filter the polling results using the following query parameters:

* `batchId`: Retrieve results for a specific batch of eligibility checks. You can find this value in the synchronous response from the [Batch Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-batch-eligibility) endpoint.
* `startDateTime`: Retrieve results for checks submitted after a specific date and time (in ISO 8601 format).

The following example example retrieves the results for batch checks submitted after `2025-12-31T00:00:00Z`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://manager.us.stedi.com/2024-04-01/eligibility-manager/polling/batch-eligibility?startDateTime=2025-12-31T00:00:00Z \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>'
```

## Polling recommendations

We recommend beginning to poll after 2 minutes, using an exponential backoff with jitter. For example, you might use something similar to the following formula:

```
wait_time = min(120 * 2^attempt, max_wait) + random(0, 30s)
```

In this formula:

* `120`: Initial wait time (2 minutes)
* `attempt`: Current retry attempt number (0-based)
* `max_wait`: Maximum wait time cap (8 hours)
* `random(0, 30s)`: Random jitter between 0-30s

## Pagination

By default, the response includes the results for up to 10 eligibility checks within a single page - each benefit response is represented as one item in the `items` array. You can control the number of results returned per page using the `pageSize` query parameter, which accepts a value between 1 and 10.

When there are additional pages of results, the response includes the `nextPageToken` property. To retrieve the next page of results, call the endpoint with the same `batchId` and other query parameters, and set the `pageToken` query parameter to the `nextPageToken` value. Repeat this process until the response doesn't include a `nextPageToken` property.

## Benefit response

Visit [Determine patient benefits](/healthcare/eligibility-active-coverage-benefits) for detailed explanations and examples of how to use the benefit response to determine the patient's active coverage, financial responsibility, requirements such as referrals or authorizations, and more.

<Warning>
  **Network status:** The response typically <u>doesn't</u> confirm whether a particular provider is in- or out-of-network for the patient's health plan. The most reliable way to confirm network status is by checking with the payer or provider directly. [Learn more](/healthcare/eligibility-network-status-authorization-referrals#is-the-provider-in-or-out-of-network%3F)
</Warning>


# 277CA Report
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-277

healthcare get /change/medicalnetwork/reports/v2/{transactionId}/277

This endpoint retrieves processed 277 Claim Acknowledgment (277CA) transactions from payers.

* Call this endpoint with the `transactionId` of the 277CA you want to retrieve.
* Stedi returns the payer's 277CA in JSON format.

## Correlate with original claim

Use the following fields to correlate the 277CA with the original claim:

### Entire Claim

The original claim's `claimInformation.patientControlNumber` is returned in two locations in the 277CA:

* `transactions.payers.claimStatusTransactions.claimStatusDetails.patientClaimStatusDetails.claims.claimStatus.patientAccountNumber`
* `transactions.payers.claimStatusTransactions.claimStatusDetails.patientClaimStatusDetails.claims.claimStatus.referencedTransactionTraceNumber`

You can use either of these properties to correlate the 277CA with the original claim, but we recommend using the `referencedTransactionTraceNumber`.

### Service line

The original claim's `claimInformation.serviceLines.providerControlNumber` is sometimes returned as the `transactions.payers.claimStatusTransactions.claimStatusDetails.patientClaimStatusDetails.claims.serviceLines.lineItemControlNumber`
in the 277CA.

This is because a 277CA only contains a `serviceLines` object (which contains the `lineItemControlNumber`) if it was rejected because of issues with the information provided for the service line.

You can review a complete response with a rejected claim in `ConvertReport277_example2`. The following snippet also shows a `serviceLines` object for a rejected claim containing the `lineItemControlNumber` property.

# 835 ERA Report
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835

healthcare get /change/medicalnetwork/reports/v2/{transactionId}/835

This endpoint retrieves processed Electronic Remittance Advice (835 ERA) transactions from payers.

* Call this endpoint with the `transactionId` of the 835 ERA you want to retrieve.
* Stedi returns the payer's 835 ERA in JSON format.

## Correlate with original claim

Use the following fields to correlate the 835 ERA with the original claim:

* **Entire claim:** The original claim's `claimInformation.patientControlNumber` is returned as the `transactions.detailInfo.paymentInfo.claimPaymentInfo.patientControlNumber` in the 835 ERA.
* **Service line:** The original claim's `claimInformation.serviceLines.providerControlNumber` is returned as the `transactions.detailInfo.paymentInfo.serviceLines.lineItemControlNumber` in the 835 ERA.

## Claim status

You cannot reliably determine a claim's status based on the amount paid in an 835 ERA. There are many instances in which a claim is accepted and the total amount paid is 0 dollars. For example, in Value-Based Care (VBC) scenarios, line item rates are usually 0 dollars, and providers are paid a flat rate per month or for a complete bundle of services.

Instead, you can use the [Claim Status API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status) to check the status of a claim in real-time.


# Insurance Discovery Check Results
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-insurance-discovery-results

healthcare get /insurance-discovery/check/v1/{discoveryId}

This endpoint retrieves the results of an [Insurance Discovery Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-insurance-discovery) with the specified `discoveryId`. You can use it to retrieve results for a particular patient asynchronously.

You can begin polling immediately after receiving a `PENDING` status response from the synchronous Insurance Discovery Check endpoint. This endpoint can take up to 120 seconds to return a response.

It's unlikely for the insurance discovery process to take more than a few minutes, so it's rare to have to poll this endpoint more than once. However, if you receive a `PENDING` status, you can poll immediately again and continue polling until the status changes to `COMPLETE.`

Note that you should only expect to retrieve checks submitted within the last 24 hours. After 24 hours, the results may no longer be available.


# List Payers
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-payers

healthcare get /payers

This endpoint lists all of the payers Stedi supports for eligibility and claims processing. You can use it to retrieve Payer IDs and to determine which payers require [enrollment](/healthcare/supported-payers#enrollment) before you can send transactions.

You can also find a searchable list of payers in the [Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network).


# CMS-1500 PDF: Transaction ID
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-pdf-1500

healthcare get /export/{transactionId}/1500/pdf

This endpoint uses a claim's `transactionId` to retrieve the [CMS-1500 Claim Form](https://www.nucc.org/index.php/1500-claim-form-mainmenu-35) PDF that Stedi automatically generates for submitted 837 professional claims. You can also review and download the PDF from the transaction's details page in Stedi.

## Send PDFs to payers

Payers have strict requirements for submitted CMS-1500 claim forms.

If you plan to send these PDFs to payers or retain them for your records, we strongly recommend visiting [CMS-1500 Claim Form PDF](/healthcare/cms-1500-claim-form-pdf) for information about how to structure claim submissions for optimal generation, the correct printer settings for generated PDFs, and general best practices.


# CMS-1500 PDF: Business Identifier
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-pdf-1500-business-identifier

healthcare get /export/pdf

This endpoint uses a business identifier to retrieve autogenerated [CMS-1500 Claim Form](https://www.nucc.org/index.php/1500-claim-form-mainmenu-35) PDFs for submitted 837 professional claims.

1. Call the endpoint with the business identifier as a query parameter for the claim form PDFs you want to retrieve. The business identifier should be the claim's correlation ID. You can find this value in the `claimReference.correlationId` property in the synchronous responses from the [Professional Claims](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims) and [Professional Claims Raw X12](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims-raw-x12) endpoints.
2. Stedi returns an array of PDFs for all claims with the specified business identifier value. PDFs are returned as a base64 encoded string.
3. Decode the base64 string and save it to a file with a .pdf extension.

You can also review and download claim form PDFs from each claim's transaction details page in Stedi.

## Setting a claim's correlation ID

A claim's correlation ID is a business identifier that you can use to retrieve claim form PDFs.

* When you submit claims through the JSON endpoint, Stedi generates the correlation ID for you, and this value will be unique for each claim.
* When you submit claims in X12 EDI through the API or an [SFTP connection](/healthcare/submit-claims-sftp-connection), you can specify your own correlation ID in the `BHT03` field.  This allows you to use the same value for multiple claims if desired.

## Send PDFs to payers

Payers have strict requirements for submitted CMS-1500 claim forms.

If you plan to send these PDFs to payers or retain them for your records, we strongly recommend visiting [CMS-1500 Claim Form PDF](/healthcare/cms-1500-claim-form-pdf) for information about how to structure claim submissions for optimal generation, the correct printer settings for generated PDFs, and general best practices.


# Eligibility mock requests
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/mock-requests-eligibility-checks



When you submit the following requests to the [Real-Time Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) endpoint with a test API key, Stedi returns mock benefits data from the specified payer you can use for testing.

You can also submit these mock requests through the [New eligibility check](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/checks/create) form in the UI when **Test mode** is enabled.

<Tip>
  Mock requests are free for testing purposes and won't incur any charges in
  your Stedi account.
</Tip>

## Test API key

When submitting these mock requests to the API, you must use a test [Stedi API key](/api-reference/index#creating-an-api-key) for authentication. When using a test API key, you can only send the following mock requests to the endpoint. Stedi returns an error if you try to send production data with a test API key.

## Medical - Active coverage

Request notes:

* `encounter`: Only service type code `30` is supported.
* `provider`: You can use any organization name and any NPI, as long as it passes [check digit validation](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/Downloads/NPIcheckdigit.pdf). To generate a dummy NPI, you can use [this free tool](https://jsfiddle.net/alexdresko/cLNB6).
* `subscriber`: You must use the exact values in the test request. Other birth dates, first names, last names, member IDs, and Social Security Numbers return errors.

### Dependent

Each of these examples represent an eligibility check for a dependent. An individual qualifies as a dependent for eligibility checks when they are listed as a dependent on the subscriber's insurance plan AND the payer cannot uniquely identify them through information outside the subscriber's policy.

These example requests follow best practices for structuring eligibility checks. Specifically, all requests include the dependent's information, including their date of birth, in the `dependents` array. Some payers may allow different structures, such as sending the dependent's information in the `subscriber` object with the subscriber's member ID. However, we recommend following the guidance outlined in the [Real-Time Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/mock-requests-eligibility-checks#dependent) endpoint documentation for the most reliable results across all payers.

The way dependent information is included in the response varies by payer. Some contain the dependent's information in the `subscriber` object. Some include the actual subscriber's information in the `subscriber` object and the dependent's information in the `dependents` array.

**Aetna**

In this example, the dependent Jordan is the subscriber John's child. Jordan's information is returned in the `dependents` array in the response.

### MBI lookup for CMS checks

You must include the patient's Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) in every eligibility check you submit to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ([Payer ID: CMS](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network?page=0\&search=CMS\&entry=JDNSN&__hstc=181257784.360aac417a3f93a63ca63bf29197fe1f.1727971380232.1743632880282.1743697406042.288&__hssc=181257784.12.1743697406042&__hsfp=2436917072)). When patients don’t know their MBI, you can use Stedi’s eligibility APIs to perform an MBI lookup using their Social Security Number instead. Visit [MBI lookup](/healthcare/mbi-lookup#enrollment) for more information.

This endpoint submits a real-time coordination of benefits (COB) check request for a patient. When a patient has active coverage through multiple health plans, COB checks can help ensure that you submit claims to the correct payer and avoid claim denials.

* Call this endpoint with a JSON payload. Each check **must** be for a Stedi-supported payer with which the patient has coverage. For example, if the patient has coverage from Cigna and UnitedHealthcare, a COB check to Aetna will return an error.
* Stedi searches a national database containing 245+ million patient coverage records from 45+ health plans, ASOs, TPAs, and others, including participation from the vast majority of national commercial health plans. Data is updated weekly to ensure accuracy.
* Stedi returns information about the patient's active health plans, the responsibility sequence number for each payer if available (such as primary or secondary), and whether coordination of benefits is required.

We recommend performing COB checks for all new patients who have coverage through one of Stedi’s supported payers.

Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans are not supported; visit the [Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network?query=eyIyNzAiOnt9LCIyNzYiOnt9LCI4MzUiOnt9LCI4MzdQIjp7fSwiODM3SSI6e30sIjgzN0QiOnt9LCJDT0IiOnsiaXNTdXBwb3J0ZWQiOnRydWV9fQ%3D%3D\&page=0) for a complete list of supported payers.

## Accurate patient data

COB checks are significantly more sensitive to data accuracy than eligibility checks. To perform successful COB checks, the patient information you provide in the check **must** match the payer's data exactly.

For example, if a payer has a patient's name stored as "Jonathan Doe", they may return benefits information when you submit an eligibility check for "Jon Doe", as long as they can identify the patient through the other information provided. However, a COB request for "Jon Doe" will fail because the name doesn't match the payer's records exactly.

To avoid unnecessary COB check failures, we strongly recommend that you first submit an eligibility check request for the patient. Then use the following data from the successful payer benefit response to build the COB request: `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth`, `memberId`.

## COB response

The COB response includes information about the patient’s active health plans, subscriber information, and coordination of benefits.

Unlike standard eligibility checks, the COB response shape is standardized across all supported payers. There are no payer-specific variations in what information is included or how the response is structured.

Visit [Interpret COB response](/healthcare/cob-response) for information and examples for using the COB response to inform claim submissions, including how to determine payer primacy.


# Create Enrollment
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-enrollment

enrollment post /enrollments

<Warning>
  This is a **beta** endpoint. We may make backwards incompatible changes.
</Warning>

This endpoint allows you to submit a request to enroll a provider for a transaction type with a payer. For example, you might need to enroll a provider with Medicaid for 835 ERAs (claim payments). Submitting enrollment requests through Stedi's API is especially useful when you need to submit bulk enrollments for many providers at once, or if you want to embed enrollment capabilities into your own software platform.

Before you can submit an enrollment request, you must add the provider's details through either the [Providers page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments) or the [Create Provider](/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-provider) endpoint. Then, you must create one enrollment request for each transaction type. For example, you would create three separate requests to enroll a provider for 837P claims (professional), 270 real-time eligibility checks, and 835 ERAs (claim payments).

Once submitted, Stedi handles the entire enrollment process for you, including submitting the enrollment to the payer, following up as needed, and giving clear guidance for any additional steps that might be required.

After you submit an enrollment request, you can review its details and status on the [Enrollments page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments) in Stedi. Alternatively, you can retrieve enrollment details programmatically using the [Get Enrollment](/api-reference/healthcare/get-enrollment) and [List Enrollments](/api-reference/healthcare/get-enrollment-list-enrollments) endpoints.

## What is transaction enrollment?

All payers require providers to complete an enrollment process before they can start receiving claim remittances (ERAs). Some payers also require enrollment before allowing providers to submit transactions like claims and eligibility checks.

Transaction enrollment involves submitting information about the provider that will send or receive transactions, including the provider's name, tax ID, [NPI](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier), billing address, and contact information.

Visit [Transaction enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) for more details.

<Tip>
  You can find out if a payer requires enrollment for a particular transaction type in the [Stedi Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network).
</Tip>

## Enrollment status

You can create enrollment requests in `DRAFT` status first and change the status to `SUBMITTED` later when you're ready to submit them to Stedi. Stedi only gets alerted about new enrollment requests once they're in `SUBMITTED` status. Once an enrollment is set to `SUBMITTED`, only Stedi can set or update its status.

Stedi changes the status to `PROVISIONING` when we begin the enrollment process with the payer.

When an enrollment status is set to `LIVE`, the provider can start exchanging the enrolled transaction type with the payer.

In rare cases, the enrollment status might be set to `REJECTED` if the payer denies the enrollment request. Rejections can happen for many reasons, but the most common are that the provider isn't credentialed with the payer and that there was incorrect data in the enrollment submission. If this happens, Stedi will contact you in Slack to help resolve the issue.

You can cancel an enrollment at any time by contacting Stedi support. Once an enrollment is canceled, Stedi sets its status to `CANCELED` and stops the enrollment process.

## Contacts

You must add a contact to an enrollment request. The payer may reach out to this contact with updates or questions about the enrollment. If you're a provider, this should be your information. If you're a vendor representing a provider, you can submit your contact information instead of the provider's information.


# Create Provider
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-provider

enrollment post /providers

<Warning>
  This is a **beta** endpoint. We may make backwards incompatible changes.
</Warning>

This endpoint allows you to create a provider record with the details required for transaction enrollment. You must complete this step before you can enroll the provider with one or more payers through the [Enrollments page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments) or the [Create Enrollment](/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-enrollment) endpoint.

All providers you create through this endpoint are also available on the [Providers page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/providers) in Stedi for you to review and manage.

## What is transaction enrollment?

## Contacts

You can add one or more contacts to a provider record. When creating an enrollment request in Stedi, you must select one of these contacts as the primary contact. However, if you plan to add enrollments through the [Create Enrollment](/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-enrollment) endpoint, you can provide the primary contact in that request instead.

The payer may reach out to the designated contact with updates or questions about the enrollment. If you’re a provider, this should be your information. If you’re a vendor representing a provider, you can submit your contact information instead of the provider’s information.


# Update Enrollment
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-update-enrollment

enrollment post /enrollments/{enrollmentId}

<Warning>This is a **beta** endpoint. We may make backwards incompatible changes.</Warning>

This endpoint allows you to update enrollments that are still in `DRAFT` status. If you need to make changes to an enrollment that is already in `SUBMITTED`, `PROVISIONING`, `LIVE`, `REJECTED`, or `CANCELED` status, contact support.

Calling this endpoint completely overwrites the previous request record. You **must** provide all the information for the enrollment in the request, not just the properties you want to update.


# Update Provider
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-update-provider

enrollment post /providers/{providerId}

<Warning>This is a **beta** endpoint. We may make backwards incompatible changes.</Warning>

This endpoint allows you to update information for an existing provider. For example, you may want to add an additional contact.

Please note:

* Calling this endpoint completely overwrites the previous request record. You **must** provide all the information for the provider in the request, not just the properties you want to update.
* Updating a provider record doesn't affect associated enrollments that are in `SUBMITTED`, `PROVISIONING` or `LIVE` status. If you need to update the provider details for an enrollment with these statuses, contact support.


# Batch Eligibility Check (270/271)
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-batch-eligibility

manager post /eligibility-manager/batch-eligibility

This endpoint allows you to submit multiple eligibility checks in a single request for Stedi to process asynchronously. You can use it to perform batches of eligibility checks, such as during periodic refreshes for a patient population or when running weekly eligibility checks for upcoming appointments.

* Call this endpoint with a JSON payload containing one or more eligibility checks. You can submit up to 500 individual eligibility checks within a single batch, and you can submit as many batches as you need to process.
* The endpoint returns a synchronous response containing a `batchId` that you can use to retrieve the results of these checks later, using the [Poll Batch Eligibility Checks](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-polling-eligibility) endpoint.
* Stedi translates each eligibility check included in the request to the X12 270 EDI format and sends it to the appropriate payer.

Eligibility checks you submit through this asynchronous endpoint don't count toward your Stedi account [concurrency budget](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#api-concurrency-limit). This allows you to stage thousands of requests through this endpoint while continuing to send real-time eligibility checks in parallel.

To perform synchronous eligibility checks, use the [Real-Time Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) endpoint.

## New integrations

Batch checks have a longer feedback cycle than real-time checks because you don't receive the payer's response immediately. That's why we strongly recommend starting with [real-time checks](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) when integrating with a new payer or working with eligibility checks for the first time. This approach allows you to ensure that your pipeline is working smoothly before you begin staging batch checks.

## Basic batch eligibility check

The content of your eligibility request depends on your use case and the payer's requirements. However, a basic batch eligibility check includes the following information in the request body:

| Information                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `provider` object, name                        | You must include the provider's name - either the `firstName` and `lastName` of a specific provider within a practice or the `organizationName`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `provider` object, identifier                  | You must include an identifier. Most often this is the [National Provider Identifier (NPI)](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `subscriber` and/or `dependents` objects       | At a minimum, our API requires that you supply at least one of these fields in the request: `memberId`, `dateOfBirth`, or `lastName`. However, each payer has different requirements, so you should supply the fields necessary for each payer to identify the subscriber in their system. When all four of `memberId`, `dateOfBirth`, `firstName`, and `lastName` are provided, payers are required to return a response if the member is in their database. Some payers may be able to search with less information, but this varies by payer. We recommend always including the patient's member ID when possible. Learn more about [patient information](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#patient-information). |
| `encounter` object, service dates              | You can specify either a single `dateOfService` or a `beginningDateOfService` and `endDateOfService`. The payer defaults to using the current date in their timezone if you don't include one. We recommend submitting dates up to 12 months in the past or up to the end of the current month. Dates outside of these ranges are likely to be rejected by many payers, since they may have archived older data and they cannot guarantee eligibility for future months. Eligibility also usually starts and ends on month boundaries.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `encounter` object, service or procedure codes | Specify `serviceTypeCodes` and/or a `procedureCode` and `productOrServiceIDQualifier` to request specific types of benefits information. Medical providers should set `items.encounter.serviceTypeCodes` to a single value of `30` - Health Benefit Plan Coverage, and dental providers should set it to `35` - Dental Care. Stedi supports all service type codes, but some payers may not support other values. Don't include multiple service type codes because many payers will either return an error or ignore additional codes entirely. If you do not include any of these fields, Stedi defaults to using `30` (Plan coverage and general benefits) as the only `serviceTypeCodes` value.                    |

<Tip>
  **MBI lookup for CMS:** You must include the patient's Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) in every eligibility check to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Payer ID: CMS). If the patient doesn't know their MBI, you can perform an MBI lookup using their Social Security Number instead. [Learn more](/healthcare/mbi-lookup)
</Tip>

### Character restrictions

Don't include the following characters in your request data: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. They are reserved for delimiters in the resulting X12 EDI transaction, and X12 doesn't support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include these restricted characters in your request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

### Autocorrection

Stedi automatically replaces backticks (`` ` ``), also known as backquotes or grave accents, with a single quote (`'`) in `subscriber` and `dependents` first and last names. This autocorrection prevents errors when submitting your request to payers and intermediary clearinghouses. Stedi returns a message in the response's `warnings` array when it makes this replacement.

### Conditional requirements

Note that objects marked as **required** are required for all requests, while others are conditionally required depending on the circumstances. When you include a conditionally required object, you must include all of its required properties.

For example, you must always include the `provider` object in your request, but you only need to include the `informationReceiverName` object when you need to include additional information about the provider making the request, such as their specific location.


# Real-Time Claim Status JSON (276/277)
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status

healthcare post /change/medicalnetwork/claimstatus/v2

This endpoint sends real-time 276 Claim Status requests to payers. You can use it to quickly check the status of existing claims.

* Call this endpoint with a JSON payload.
* Stedi translates the JSON to the X12 276 EDI format and sends it to the payer.
* The endpoint returns a synchronous response from the payer in JSON format. The response contains information about the claims matching the criteria you provided in the request and their current status.

The response may contain information about more than one claim, if the payer has multiple claims on file that match the information you provided.

## Best practices

We recommend the following best practices to increase your chances of receiving status information.

### Supply a date of services range

Supply a date range that is at least plus or minus 7 days from the date of the services listed in the claim. The payer may have stored a different date for the encounter than the one in your records, so providing a date range increases the likelihood that the payer will find a match.

We also recommend keeping the dates of service range to 30 days or less. Some payers may reject requests with a date range that is too wide.

### Don't provide too much information

Providing too much information in a claim status request can negatively affect the results. That's why we recommend first sending a base request with only the following information:

| Information               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tradingPartnerServiceId` | This is the Payer ID. Visit the [Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network) for a complete list. You can send requests using the Primary Payer ID, the Stedi Payer ID, or any alias listed in the payer record.                                                                      |
| `controlNumber`           | An integer to identify the transaction. You can set this to whatever value you prefer, and it does not need to be globally unique.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `providers`               | The provider information from the original claim. To start, provide only the `npi`, `organizationName`, and `providerType` properties.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `subscriber`              | The subscriber information from the original claim. To start, provide only the `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth` and `memberId` properties.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `encounter`               | The encounter information from the original claim status request. To start, provide only the `beginningDateOfService` and `endDateOfService` properties. Remember that you should provide a date range that is plus or minus 7 days from the date of service listed in the claim for best results. |

If this base request fails to return results, try adding in other information like `encounter.tradingPartnerClaimNumber` and `providers.taxId`.

You will eventually learn payer-specific nuances and can build logic in your system to supply additional information to specific payers. For example, some payers may have better success rates when you include the claim number.

## Character restrictions

Don't include the following characters in your request data: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. They are reserved for delimiters in the resulting X12 EDI transaction, and X12 doesn't support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include these restricted characters in your request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

## Conditional requirements

Note that objects marked as **required** are required for all requests, while others are conditionally required depending on the circumstances. When you include a conditionally required object, you must include all of its required properties.

For example, you must always include the `subscriber` object in your request, but you only need to include the `serviceLineInformation` object when you want to request the status for a specific service line.

## Payer limitations

Payers generally only allow a provider organization to check the status of the claims they submitted. This means that you likely won't be able to check the status of a claim submitted by a different provider organization or by the patient themselves, even if you have all of the details about the claim. Payers impose these access controls to protect plan member privacy and confidential commercial data.

Payers also often archive claims older than 18 months, but this varies by payer. If you try to check the status of a claim from several years ago, the payer may return an error even if the information you submit matches a real historical claim.

## Timeout

Requests to payers typically time out at 1 minute, though Stedi's API can keep connections open longer than that if needed.


# Real-Time Claim Status (276/277) Raw X12
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status-raw-x12

healthcare post /change/medicalnetwork/claimstatus/v2/raw-x12

This endpoint sends 276 Claim Status requests to payers in raw X12 EDI format. This is ideal if you have an existing system that generates X12 EDI files and you want to send them through Stedi's API.

* Call this endpoint with a payload in [276 X12 EDI format](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/claim-status-request-x212/01GRYB6A4XEJQ61Y2K2KT606E5).
* Stedi validates the EDI and sends the status request to the payer.
* The endpoint returns a synchronous response from the payer in JSON format. The response contains information about the claims matching the criteria you provided in the request and their current status.

The response may contain information about more than one claim, if the payer has multiple claims on file that match the information you provided.

## Best practices

We recommend the following best practices to increase your chances of receiving status information.

### Supply a date of services range

Supply a date range that is at least plus or minus 7 days from the date of the services listed in the claim. The payer may have stored a different date for the encounter than the one in your records, so providing a date range increases the likelihood that the payer will find a match.

We also recommend keeping the dates of service range to 30 days or less. Some payers may reject requests with a date range that is too wide.

### Don't provide too much information

Providing too much information in a claim status request can negatively affect the results. That's why we recommend first sending a request with only the following information:

* `Loop 2100C`: `NM109` (National Provider Identifier) and `NM103` (Provider Last Name or Organization Name)
* `Loop 2000D` or `2000E`: `DMG02` (Subscriber/Patient Birth Date)
* `Loop 2100B`: `NM1` (Information Receiver Name)
* `Loop 2100D`: `NM103` (Subscriber Last Name), `NM103` (Subscriber First Name), and `NM109` (Member Identification Number)
* `Loop 2200D`: `DTP03` (Claim Service Period) that is plus or minus 7 days from the date of service listed in the claim
* `Loop 2200D` or `2200E`: `TRN` (Claim Status Tracking Number)

If this base request fails to return results, try adding in other information like `Loop 2200D REF02` (Payer Claim Control Number).

You will eventually learn payer-specific nuances and can build logic in your system to supply additional information to specific payers. For example, some payers may have better success rates when you include the claim number.

## Character restrictions

Only use the following characters as delimiters: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. The X12 format doesn’t support using escape sequences, so you can't include delimiters or special characters as part of the request data. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include restricted characters as anything other than delimiters in the request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

# Professional Claims (837P) JSON
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims

healthcare post /change/medicalnetwork/professionalclaims/v3/submission

This endpoint sends 837P (professional) claims to payers. Visit [Submit professional claims](/healthcare/submit-professional-claims) for a full how-to guide.

* Call this endpoint with a JSON payload.
* Stedi translates your request to the X12 837 EDI format and sends it to the payer.
* The endpoint returns a response from Stedi in JSON format containing information about the claim you submitted and whether the submission was successful.

## Send test claims

All claims you submit through this endpoint are sent to the payer as production claims unless you explicitly designate them as test data.

To send test claims, set the `usageIndicator` property in the test claim body to `T`. This allows you to filter for test claims on the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page in the Stedi portal.

Note that you will receive a 277 Claim Acknowledgment in response to test claims, allowing you to test your workflow end to end, but you will not receive a test 835 (ERA) response.

## Basic claim submission

The content of your claim submission depends on your use case and the payer's requirements. However, a basic claim submission includes the following information in the request body:

| Information                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `receiver` object                       | Information about the payer, such as an insurance company or government agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `subscriber` and/or `dependent` objects | Information about the patient who received the medical services. Note that if a dependent has their own, unique member ID for their health plan, you should submit their information in the `subscriber` object and omit the `dependent` object from the request. You can check whether the dependent has a unique member ID by submitting an [Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) to the payer for the dependent. The payer will return the member ID in the `dependents.memberId` field, if present. |
| `claimInformation` object               | Information about the claim, such as the patient control number, claim charge amount, and place of service code.

### Character restrictions

Don't include the following characters in your request data: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. They are reserved for delimiters in the resulting X12 EDI transaction, and X12 doesn't support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include these restricted characters in your request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

### Identify service lines

A claim can contain multiple service lines. Since the payer may accept, reject, or pay a subset of those lines, you can receive an 835 response that references a `patientControlNumber`, but only pertains to some of the service lines.

However, the `claimInformation.serviceLines.providerControlNumber` serves as a unique identifier for each service line in your claim submission. This value appears in the 277CA and 835 ERA responses as the `lineItemControlNumber`, allowing you to correlate these responses to specific service lines from the original claim. If you don't set the `providerControlNumber` for a service line, Stedi uses a random UUID.

Stedi returns service line identifiers in the `claimReference.serviceLines` object of the synchronous API response.

## Conditional requirements

Note that objects marked as **required** are required for all requests, while others are conditionally required depending on the circumstances. When you include a conditionally required object, you must include all of its required properties.

For example, you must always include the `subscriber` object in your request, but you only need to include the `supervising` object when the rendering provider is supervised by a physician.

## Enhanced validation

You can optionally set the `Stedi-Validation` header to `snip` for enhanced validation on your claim submission.

[Enhanced validation](/healthcare/enhanced-claim-validation) uses hundreds of additional *edits* (the industry term for validation rules) to increase claim acceptance rates. These include Strategic National Implementation Process (SNIP) validations. Stedi also automatically fixes common errors and monitors payer rejections to proactively build out new rules.

<Warning>
  There is an **additional cost per claim submission** when you use enhanced validation. Please reach out to support for access and pricing information.
</Warning>

## CMS-1500 Claim Form PDF

When you submit a claim, Stedi automatically generates a [1500 claim form](https://www.nucc.org/index.php/1500-claim-form-mainmenu-35) PDF. Please review the behaviors and recommendations in the [CMS-1500 claim form PDF](/healthcare/submit-professional-claims#cms-1500-claim-form-pdf) documentation if you plan to send the generated PDFs to payers or retain them for your records.

However, the line item control number serves as a unique identifier for each service line in your claim submission. You can set the line item control number in Loop 2400 `REF02`, when `REF01` = `6R`. The line item control number appears in the 277CA and 835 ERA responses as the `lineItemControlNumber`, allowing you to correlate these responses to specific service lines from the original claim. If you don’t set the line item control number for a service line, Stedi uses a random UUID.

Stedi returns service line identifiers in the `claimReference.serviceLines` object of the synchronous API response.

## Character restrictions

Only use the following characters as delimiters: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. The X12 format doesn’t support using escape sequences, so you can't include delimiters or special characters as part of the request data. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include restricted characters as anything other than delimiters in the request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

## Enhanced validation

You can optionally set the `Stedi-Validation` header to `snip` for enhanced validation on your claim submission.

[Enhanced validation](/healthcare/enhanced-claim-validation) uses hundreds of additional *edits* (the industry term for validation rules) to increase claim acceptance rates. These include Strategic National Implementation Process (SNIP) validations. Stedi also automatically fixes common errors and monitors payer rejections to proactively build out new rules.

<Warning>
  There is an **additional cost per claim submission** when you use enhanced validation. Please reach out to support for access and pricing information.
</Warning>

## CMS-1500 Claim Form PDF

When you submit a claim, Stedi automatically generates a [1500 claim form](https://www.nucc.org/index.php/1500-claim-form-mainmenu-35) PDF. Please review the behaviors and recommendations in the [CMS-1500 claim form PDF](/healthcare/submit-professional-claims#cms-1500-claim-form-pdf) documentation if you plan to send the generated PDFs to payers or retain them for your records.


# Dental Claims (837D) JSON
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-dental-claims

healthcare post /dental-claims/submission

This endpoint sends 837D (dental) claims to payers.

* Call this endpoint with a JSON payload.
* Stedi translates your request to the X12 837 EDI format and sends it to the payer.
* The endpoint returns a response from Stedi in JSON format containing information about the claim you submitted and whether the submission was successful.

## Send test claims

All claims you submit through this endpoint are sent to the payer as production claims unless you explicitly designate them as test data.

To send test claims, set the `usageIndicator` property in the test claim body to `T`. This allows you to filter for test claims on the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page in the Stedi portal.

Note that you will receive a 277 Claim Acknowledgment in response to test claims, allowing you to test your workflow end to end, but you will not receive a test 835 (ERA) response.

## Basic claim submission

The content of your claim submission depends on your use case and the payer's requirements. However, a basic claim submission includes the following information in the request body:

| Information                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `subscriber` and/or `dependent` objects | Information about the patient who received the medical services. Note that if a dependent has their own, unique member ID for their health plan, you should submit their information in the `subscriber` object and omit the `dependent` object from the request. You can check whether the dependent has a unique member ID by submitting an [Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) to the payer for the dependent. The payer will return the member ID in the `dependents.memberId` field, if present. |

### Character restrictions

Don't include the following characters in your request data: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. They are reserved for delimiters in the resulting X12 EDI transaction, and X12 doesn't support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include these restricted characters in your request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">

</Accordion>

### Identify service lines

A claim can contain multiple service lines. Since the payer may accept, reject, or pay a subset of those lines, you can receive an 835 response that references a `patientControlNumber`, but only pertains to some of the service lines.

However, the `claimInformation.serviceLines.providerControlNumber` serves as a unique identifier for each service line in your claim submission. This value appears in the 277CA and 835 ERA responses as the `lineItemControlNumber`, allowing you to correlate these responses to specific service lines from the original claim. If you don't set the `providerControlNumber` for a service line, Stedi uses a random UUID.

Stedi returns service line identifiers in the `claimReference.serviceLines` object of the synchronous API response.

## Conditional requirements

Note that objects marked as **required** are required for all requests, while others are conditionally required depending on the circumstances. When you include a conditionally required object, you must include all of its required properties.

For example, you must always include the `subscriber` object in your request, but you only need to include the `supervising` object when the rendering provider is supervised by a physician.

# Real-Time Eligibility Check (270/271) JSON
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility

healthcare post /change/medicalnetwork/eligibility/v3

This endpoint sends real-time eligibility checks to payers. Visit [Check eligibility](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks) for a full how-to guide.

* Call this endpoint with a JSON payload.
* Stedi translates your request to the X12 270 EDI format and sends it to the payer.
* The endpoint returns a synchronous response from the payer in both JSON and raw X12 EDI format. The response contains the patient's eligibility and benefits information.

Real-time eligibility checks are ideal for in-person patient visits, telehealth appointments, and other scenarios where you need immediate information about a patient's coverage.

We recommend always starting with real-time checks when integrating with a new payer. This approach allows you to quickly test and refine your pipeline through fast feedback loops. Once you're comfortable with real-time checks, you may also want to start sending asynchronous batch checks to perform periodic refreshes for all or a subset of patients.

## Test endpoint

When you submit specific mock requests, Stedi returns mock benefits data from the specified payer you can use for testing. You must use a test [Stedi API key](/api-reference/index#creating-an-api-key) for authentication.

Mock requests are free for testing purposes and won't incur any charges in your Stedi account.

<Accordion title="Test eligibility check - CIGNA">
  Notes:

  * `encounter`: Only service type code `30` is supported.
  * `provider`: You can use any organization name and any NPI, as long as it passes [check digit validation](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/Downloads/NPIcheckdigit.pdf). To generate a dummy NPI, you can use [this free tool](https://jsfiddle.net/alexdresko/cLNB6).
  * `subscriber`: You must use the exact values in the test request. Other birthdates, first names, last names, and member IDs return errors.

| `tradingPartnerServiceId`                      | You can find the payer ID in our list of [supported payers](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network). If you don't know the payer, try submitting an [insurance discovery check](/healthcare/insurance-discovery) instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `provider` object, name                        | You must include the provider's name - either the `firstName` and `lastName` of a specific provider within a practice or the `organizationName`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `provider` object, identifier                  | You must include an identifier. Most often this is the [National Provider Identifier (NPI)](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `subscriber` and/or `dependents` objects       | At a minimum, our API requires that you supply at least one of these fields in the request: `memberId`, `dateOfBirth`, or `lastName`. However, each payer has different requirements, so you should supply the fields necessary for each payer to identify the subscriber in their system. When all four of `memberId`, `dateOfBirth`, `firstName`, and `lastName` are provided, payers are required to return a response if the member is in their database. Some payers may be able to search with less information, but this varies by payer. We recommend always including the patient's member ID when possible. Learn more about [patient information](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#patient-information). |
| `encounter` object, service dates              | You can specify either a single `dateOfService` or a `beginningDateOfService` and `endDateOfService`. The payer defaults to using the current date in their timezone if you don't include one. We recommend submitting dates up to 12 months in the past or up to the end of the current month. Dates outside of these ranges are likely to be rejected by many payers, since they may have archived older data and they cannot guarantee eligibility for future months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `encounter` object, service or procedure codes | Specify `serviceTypeCodes` and/or a `procedureCode` and `productOrServiceIDQualifier` to request specific types of benefits information. We don't know which payers support multiple service type codes, so we recommend including no more than one in each request. If you do not include any of these fields, Stedi defaults to using `30` (Plan coverage and general benefits) as the only `serviceTypeCodes` value. Learn more about [checking eligibility for specific services](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#checking-eligibility-for-specific-services).                                                                                                                                                 |

<Tip>
  **MBI lookup for CMS:** You must include the patient's Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) in every eligibility check to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Payer ID: CMS). If the patient doesn't know their MBI, you can perform an MBI lookup using their Social Security Number instead. [Learn more](/healthcare/mbi-lookup)
</Tip>

### Character restrictions

Don't include the following characters in your request data: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. They are reserved for delimiters in the resulting X12 EDI transaction, and X12 doesn't support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include these restricted characters in your request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

### Autocorrection

Stedi automatically replaces backticks (`` ` ``), also known as backquotes or grave accents, with a single quote (`'`) in `subscriber` and `dependents` first and last names. This autocorrection prevents errors when submitting your request to payers and intermediary clearinghouses. Stedi returns a message in the response's `warnings` array when it makes this replacement.

### Conditional requirements

Note that objects marked as **required** are required for all requests, while others are conditionally required depending on the circumstances. When you include a conditionally required object, you must include all of its required properties.

For example, you must always include the `provider` object in your request, but you only need to include the `dependents` object when you need to request benefits information for a dependent on the subscriber's insurance plan.

## Benefit response

Visit [Determine patient benefits](/healthcare/eligibility-active-coverage-benefits) for detailed explanations and examples of how to use the benefit response to determine the patient's active coverage, financial responsibility, requirements such as referrals or authorizations, and more.

<Warning>
  **Network status:** The response typically <u>doesn't</u> confirm whether a particular provider is in- or out-of-network for the patient's health plan. The most reliable way to confirm network status is by checking with the payer or provider directly. [Learn more](/healthcare/eligibility-network-status-authorization-referrals#is-the-provider-in-or-out-of-network%3F)
</Warning>

## Timeout

Insurance payers may take up to 60 seconds to respond to a request, but Stedi holds real-time eligibility check requests open for up to 120 seconds before timing out. During this period, Stedi attempts multiple retries to payers in an effort to complete your request.

Canceling and retrying requests before Stedi's automatic retry period ends may create multiple ongoing requests to payers and increase your concurrency usage.

### Request hedging

When eligibility responses are taking too long, you can use request hedging to try to get results faster. To implement request hedging, send a second request at some internal duration cutoff (for example, 30 seconds) without cancelling the first request. Then, you can use whichever result comes back first. If one of the requests fails, you can wait for the second request to see if it's successful.

## Concurrency limit

Our real-time eligibility check endpoint has rate limiting on a per-account basis. This limit is based on *concurrent* requests, not requests per second. The default rate limit is 5 concurrent requests; if you need a higher limit, reach out to [Support](https://www.stedi.com/contact).

Your transactions per second (and thus your concurrency limit) will vary based on the payer response time. If you reach the maximum concurrency limit, Stedi rejects additional requests with a `429` HTTP code until one of your previous requests is completed. Rejected requests have the following error message:

```
{
  "message": "The request can't be submitted because the sender's submission has been throttled: CUSTOMER_LIMIT",
  "code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "eligibilitySearchId": "019249c7-e176-76b0-a46a-3aef1a519bc4"
}
```

Asynchronous [batch eligibility checks](/healthcare/batch-refresh-eligibility-checks) don’t count toward your Stedi account concurrency budget. This allows you to stage thousands of batch requests while continuing to send real-time requests.

# Real-Time Eligibility Check (270/271) Raw X12
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility-raw-x12

healthcare post /change/medicalnetwork/eligibility/v3/raw-x12

This endpoint sends real-time eligibility checks to payers in raw X12 EDI format. This is ideal if you have an existing system that generates X12 EDI files and you want to send them through Stedi's API.

* Call this endpoint with payload in [270 X12 EDI format](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-eligibility-benefit-inquiry-x279a1/01GRYB6GTDJ4MEP5Z16CGMQWT6).
* Stedi validates the EDI and sends the eligibility check to the payer.
* The endpoint returns a synchronous response from the payer in both JSON and raw X12 EDI format. The response contains the patient's eligibility and benefits information.

Real-time eligibility checks are ideal for in-person patient visits, telehealth appointments, and other scenarios where you need immediate information about a patient's coverage.

We recommend always starting with real-time checks when integrating with a new payer. This approach allows you to quickly test and refine your pipeline through fast feedback loops. Once you're comfortable with real-time checks, you may also want to start sending asynchronous batch checks to perform periodic refreshes for all or a subset of patients.

## MBI lookup for CMS

You must include the patient's Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) in every eligibility check to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Payer ID: CMS).

If the patient doesn't know their MBI, you can perform an MBI lookup using their Social Security Number instead. [Learn more](/healthcare/mbi-lookup)

## Character restrictions

Only use the following characters as delimiters: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. The X12 format doesn’t support using escape sequences, so you can't include delimiters or special characters as part of the request data. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include restricted characters as anything other than delimiters in the request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

# Institutional Claims (837I) JSON
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-institutional-claims

healthcare post /change/medicalnetwork/institutionalclaims/v1/submission

This endpoint sends 837I (institutional) claims to payers. Visit [Submit institutional claims](/healthcare/submit-institutional-claims) for a full how-to guide.

* Call this endpoint with a JSON payload.
* Stedi translates your request to the X12 837 EDI format and sends it to the payer.
* The endpoint returns a response from Stedi in JSON format containing information about the claim you submitted and whether the submission was successful.

## Send test claims

All claims you submit through this endpoint are sent to the payer as production claims unless you explicitly designate them as test data.

To send test claims, set the `usageIndicator` property in the test claim body to `T`. This allows you to filter for test claims on the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page in the Stedi portal.

Note that you will receive a 277 Claim Acknowledgment in response to test claims, allowing you to test your workflow end to end, but you will not receive a test 835 (ERA) response.

## Basic claim submission

The content of your claim submission depends on your use case and the payer's requirements. However, a basic claim submission includes the following information in the request body:

| Information                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   |

| `receiver` object                       | Information about the entity responsible for the payment of the claim, such as an insurance company or government agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   |
| `subscriber` and/or `dependent` objects | Information about the patient who received the medical services. Note that if a dependent has their own, unique member ID for their health plan, you should submit their information in the `subscriber` object and omit the `dependent` object from the request. You can check whether the dependent has a unique member ID by submitting an [Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) to the payer for the dependent. The payer will return the member ID in the `dependents.memberId` field, if present. |   |
| `claimInformation` object               | Information about the claim, such as the claim filing code (identifies the type of claim), claim charge amount, and place of service code. It also includes information about each individual service line included in the claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |
| Billing provider                        | You **must** supply information about the billing provider in either the `providers` or `billing` object. This includes the provider's [NPI](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier), name, and other information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |

### Character restrictions

Don't include the following characters in your request data: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. They are reserved for delimiters in the resulting X12 EDI transaction, and X12 doesn't support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include these restricted characters in your request.

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

### Identify service lines

A claim can contain multiple service lines. Since the payer may accept, reject, or pay a subset of those lines, you can receive an 835 response that references a `patientControlNumber`, but only pertains to some of the service lines.

However, the `claimInformation.serviceLines.lineItemControlNumber` serves as a unique identifier for each service line in your claim submission. This value appears in the 277CA and 835 ERA responses as the `lineItemControlNumber`, allowing you to correlate these responses to specific service lines from the original claim. We strongly recommend setting the `lineItemControlNumber` to a ULID or other unique identifier for each service line. We recommend using a ULID instead of a UUID because the property has a max of 30 characters.

## Conditional requirements

Note that objects marked as **required** are required for all requests, while others are conditionally required depending on the circumstances. When you include a conditionally required object, you must include all of its required properties.

For example, you must always include the `subscriber` object in your request, but you only need to include the `supervising` object when the rendering provider is supervised by a physician.


# Insurance Discovery Check
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-insurance-discovery

healthcare post /insurance-discovery/check/v1

This endpoint submits an insurance discovery check request for a patient. You can use an insurance discovery check to find a patient’s active coverage using only their demographic data.

You may need to perform an insurance discovery check when a patient provides outdated insurance details, doesn’t have their insurance card, or can’t provide insurance details in an urgent care situation. You may also want to use insurance discovery checks to simplify patient onboarding by reducing the amount of information new patients must provide to schedule an appointment.

1. Call this endpoint with as much patient demographic information as possible to increase the chances of finding matching coverage. You'll also need to include information like the provider's NPI and the service date, similar to an eligibility check.
2. Stedi determines if the patient has active coverage with one or more payers. This process involves demographic lookups to enrich partial patient details, comparisons across third-party data sources to determine member IDs, and submitting real-time eligibility checks to payers to detect coverage.
3. When the insurance discovery check is complete, Stedi returns an array of potential active coverages along with subscriber details and benefits information.

You should always review the results to ensure the returned subscriber information for each active health plan matches the demographic information for the patient. Once you confirm matching coverage, you can use the benefits information to determine the patient’s eligibility for services. You generally shouldn’t need to perform a follow-up eligibility check since the insurance discovery response includes the same benefits information as a standard eligibility check.

## Enrollment requirements

You should submit a transaction enrollment request for each provider for whom you plan to submit insurance discovery checks. To enroll your providers, please download the [enrollment spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tpXzNJSun_8ki5Da6oZ1T8ieIDJWbSmpX95dLn8_aLE/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and add one row for each provider. You'll be required to provide the following information:

* National Provider Identifier (NPI)
* Tax Identification Number (TIN)
* Medicaid Provider ID (if applicable)

You can email the completed template to [enrollments@stedi.com](mailto:enrollments@stedi.com), or drop it in your shared Slack channel.

## Response

This endpoint can take up to 120 seconds to return a response, though it's often faster.

The response can have one of two `status` values:

* `COMPLETE` - Stedi has completed the insurance discovery search for the patient. If Stedi finds coverage for the patient, the `items` array will contain the results. If Stedi doesn't find any coverage for the patient, the `items` array will be empty.
* `PENDING` - Stedi is still processing the insurance discovery search for the patient. You can use the `discoveryId` in the response to retrieve the results asynchronously.

## Retrieve results asynchronously

If the synchronous insurance discovery response indicates that the search is still `PENDING`, you can use the `discoveryId` to retrieve the complete results asynchronously from the [Insurance Discovery Check Results](/api-reference/healthcare/get-insurance-discovery-results) endpoint.

## Clearinghouse APIs

Our APIs allow you to automate business flows like [eligibility checks](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) and [claims processing](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims). We also offer APIs for retrieving [Stedi's up-to-date payer list](/api-reference/healthcare/get-payers) and [provider enrollments](/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-provider) with payers.

## EDI platform APIs

You can programmatically accomplish almost anything you can do in Stedi. In practice, most integrations only need to implement two integration points:

* A method in your system for calling the [Create Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint when you need to send a transaction **to** a trading partner
* A method in your system for receiving [destination webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/destinations) from Stedi when you receive a transaction **from** a trading partner, or when an exception occurs.

## Authentication

You need an API key to use any Stedi API. You pass the API key in the `Authorization` header of every request and Stedi determines which resources you can access.

### API key types

You can create two types of Stedi API keys: Test and Production.

Test API keys allow you to send mock requests to Stedi healthcare APIs and receive realistic mock responses, so you can test your integration without sending PHI or PII.

* Test keys can only be used in test mode with approved test requests. APIs that support test keys include a list of approved test requests you can send.
* Test keys are currently supported for the [Real-Time Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) API.

Production API keys allow you to send transactions to trading partners and payers. All Stedi APIs support production API keys.

### Creating an API key

To create an API key:

1. Log into your [Stedi account](https://portal.stedi.com/app).
2. Click your account name at the top right of the screen.
3. Select **API Keys**.
4. Click **Generate new API Key**.
5. Enter a name for your API key. We recommend using a unique name and adding a `test` or `production` prefix to indicate the key type.
6. Choose whether the key is for test or production use.
7. Click **Generate**. Stedi generates an API key and allows you to copy it.

<Warning>
  Make sure you copy your API key and store it in a safe location. Once you
  close the modal, Stedi will not show the API key again.
</Warning>

### API key access

Within your Stedi account, members can be [assigned to roles](/accounts-and-billing/index#assigning-member-roles) with different permissions. Production API keys inherit the permissions of the account member who created them and keep those permissions even if the creator's role is later updated.

### Passing the API key

Every request you send needs to include an API key. You pass the API key in the `Authorization` header. For example, if your API key is `Jclcke.ZHqS3demo4dS16XZ1KeyBY7`, you would insert it into the header according to the following example:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/x12/partnerships/{partnershipId}/generate-edi \
  --header 'Authorization: Jclcke.ZHqS3demo4dS16XZ1KeyBY7' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{ ... }'
```

<Note>
  Stedi supports the previous method of prefixing the API key with `Key` (e.g.
  `Authorization: Key Jclcke.ZHqS3demo4dS16XZ1KeyBY7`) for
  backwards-compatibility.
</Note>

## Pagination

When you request a list of resources, the response may contain a subset of available responses. In that case, the response will include a key called `next_page_token`. To retrieve the next page of results, repeat the request, but add the query parameter `page_token` and give it the value you received in the response.

For example, when you call the [List Transactions API](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-list-transactions), the result contains a list of every transaction within your Stedi account and a token for the next page.

```javascript
{
  "items": [ ... ],
  "next_page_token": "2t7M75ZN1w4OnYFKKT0SUkT95w_ULzPR"
}
```

You can then request the next page of results like this:

```bash
  curl --request GET \
    --url https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/transactions?page_token=2t7M75ZN1w4OnYFKKT0SUkT95w_ULzPR \
    --header "Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"
```

As long as the response contains `next_page_token`, there are more results available. If a response doesn't contain `next_page_token`, then you're on the last page.

## Error Responses

If you make a request that the API can't fulfill, the response code will be in the 4xx range and the response body will contain the following two fields.

* `error` – A code indicating what went wrong.
* `message` – A human-readable message describing what went wrong.

You can use `error` to write code that handles the error and you can use `message` when you're debugging the problem yourself. If a response needs to report multiple errors, it will include an array called `errors`, but even in that case, the `error` and `message` fields will be available at top level.

It's possible for a response to contain both a result and an error. This happens when something went wrong, but the API is able to give a partial or best-effort result.

### `403` Unauthorized

When you receive a `403` error from Stedi, it's likely due to one of the following reasons:

* Your API key is invalid or expired.
* You accidentally sent a `GET` request to an endpoint that only accepts `POST` requests.
* Your IP address was previously flagged as malicious. Stedi uses the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Web Application Filter (WAF) as a layer of security for our APIs. Our WAF configurations include AWS-managed rules that determine whether to allow or block each request. One set of rules blocks requests when the [source IP address is determined to be malicious](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep-amazon), based on Amazon internal threat intelligence. We've seen this happen most often with requests sent from Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but it can occasionally happen with requests sent through other platforms as well. You can fix this issue by routing your requests through a dedicated virtual private cloud (VPC) with a static IP address.

## Idempotency keys

Idempotency allows you to make an API request multiple times without causing different outcomes. Adding idempotency keys to requests can prevent sending duplicate data to your trading partners in the case of network errors or other intermittent failures.

You can safely retry requests with the same idempotency key as many times as necessary within 24 hours after making the first request. Within the 24 hour period, if you reuse the same key with different request contents (change the HTTP method, path, or request body), Stedi returns a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error. After 24 hours, Stedi allows the request to execute again even if you submit the same idempotency token.

If you reuse the same key on a new request while the original request is still being processed, Stedi returns a `409 Conflict`. You can retry the request after the original request is completed. The `409` response includes a `Retry-After` header indicating a suggested number of seconds to wait before retrying.

### Generating keys

For APIs that support idempotency, you can generate and include an idempotency key within the `Idempotency-Key` header of your request. Our implementation conforms to the draft IETF [Idempotency-Key HTTP Header Field](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/) RFC.

The token can be any unique string, such as a UUID. Common approaches to generating tokens are:

* Use an algorithm that generates a token with enough randomness, like UUID v4.
* Derive the key from data related to the API call, like a partnership ID and a transaction number. This approach helps you prevent duplicate requests for the same partnership and request type.

### Adding keys to your request

Once you have generated your idempotency key, include it in the header of your API request. For example, the header for a request to the [Create Outbound Interchange API](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-generate-edi) would look like this:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/x12/partnerships/{partnershipId}/generate-edi \
  --header 'Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}' \
  --header 'Idempotency-Key: 5b6f6d3e-2c6d-4e6f-8e6f-6d3e2c6d4e6f' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{ ... }'
```

## API upgrades

We strive to maintain backwards compatibility. The following changes are considered backwards compatible:

* New API resources
* Additional optional parameters to API requests
* Additional fields in API responses
* Changes in the order of properties in API responses
* Changes in human-readable error messages
* Downgrading mandatory parameters to optional parameters.

When we introduce a breaking change, we release a root-level, dated version.


# Configure destinations
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/destinations/configure-destinations



<Warning>
  Destinations is a legacy feature. It is not deprecated, but it has been
  superseded by [Webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index). Please
  [contact support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) with questions.
</Warning>

To configure a destination webhook, you must first create an [auth](#auth), then one or more [destinations](#destination) for the auth, and then one or more [event bindings](#event-bindings) that trigger each destination.

You may want to configure webhooks to:

* Send processed transaction data to an external system. You can optionally attach a Stedi mapping to transform the payload before sending it to the destination. We recommend only using a mapping with a destination when you know your mapping output will be under 1MB in size. Otherwise, you can use the [Map Transaction Output](/api-reference/edi-platform/get-map-transaction-output) endpoint to retrieve mapped data asynchronously.
* Send Stedi events to systems like Slack and PagerDuty or to implement more advanced functionality.

## Auth

An auth defines how to authenticate with a specific API. You can use a single auth configuration across multiple destinations. Stedi supports the following types of auth configurations.

| Type       | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Keys   | The API keys as headers in the request. The most common version is ‘bearer tokens’.                                                                     |
| Basic Auth | [HTTP Basic Auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Authentication), where you provide a username and password.                              |
| OAuth 2.0  | [OAuth 2.0 Auth](https://oauth.net/2/), where you can set the Authorization endpoint and parameters, the HTTP method, a client ID, and a client secret. |

### Unauthenticated endpoints

There isn't a 'no-auth' option with Destinations, but you can achieve this by configuring the API Keys auth to use arbitrary values for `Header name` and `Value` (e.g. `Header name: x-stedi-noauth` and `Value: dummy`). Since the receiving API isn't authenticating the call, it will ignore these values and accept the request.

### Create auth

To create a new auth:

1. Go to the [Destinations](https://portal.stedi.com/app/events/destinations) page.
2. Click **Add new auth**.
3. Enter a name for the auth.
4. Choose the appropriate **Authentication type**.
5. Enter the details for the auth.
6. Click **Done**.

## Destination

The destination defines which URL endpoint should be called when the destination is invoked, and which HTTP method to use (`POST`, `PUT`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).

Destinations are scoped to a single auth. However, you might have multiple destinations for a single system integration, each with a different endpoint. For example, one endpoint for creating Sales Orders and another for Item Fulfillments.

### Create destination

To create a new destination:

1. Go to the [Destinations](https://portal.stedi.com/app/events/destinations) page.
2. Under the desired auth, click **Add destination**.
3. Enter a name.
4. Choose a **Method** and enter an **Endpoint**.
5. (Optional) Enter a **Max executions per second**. Use this to avoid overloading the target service.

## Event bindings

Event bindings allow you to specify which events trigger the destination webhook. You can create multiple event bindings for a single destination. For example, you may want to create an event binding for each type of transaction you want to send to your API.

### Create event binding

To create a new event binding:

1. Go to the [Destinations](https://portal.stedi.com/app/events/destinations) page.
2. Click the desired destination.
3. Click the **Edit** tab.
4. Click **Add event binding**.
5. Choose an **Event detail-type** and complete the remaining fields.
6. (Optional) Select a mapping to transform the payload before sending it to the destination. This is only available for `transaction.processed.v2` and `fragment.processed.v2` events.
7. Click **Create binding**.

## Send transaction data

You can create a `transaction.processed.v2` event binding to send processed transaction data to external APIs. If the transaction set uses [fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) to split the payload into smaller chunks, you can also configure an event binding for `fragment.processed.v2` events.

You can optionally add a Stedi mapping to both types of event bindings to transform the payload shape before sending it to the destination.

<WebhookDuplicateDeliveries />

### Event types

Stedi emits a `transaction.processed.v2` event each time it processes a transaction. An EDI file can contain multiple transactions, so a single EDI file can produce multiple events that each invoke the configured destination webhook. When you use a `transaction.processed.v2` event to trigger a destination, Stedi includes the [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) transaction in the payload along with the event data.

The transaction itself is only included as part of the event if the whole response (payload + event) is \< 1MB. Otherwise, the event will contain a section that specifies the transaction was too big to be included and you can retrieve the actual transaction by making a request to the `transaction` artifact.

When [fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) are enabled, the `transaction.processed.v2` payload includes an empty array in place of the fragmented segment. Stedi then emits one `fragment.processed.v2` event for each fragment within the processed transaction. The event contains a link you can use to retrieve the fragment data as well as information about the original transaction, such as the ISA and GS headers.

Refer to [Events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types) for complete details and examples.

### Configure event bindings

Choose `transaction.processed.v2` or `fragment.processed.v2` as the **Event detail-type** and complete the following fields:

1. (Optional) Choose a **Transaction set ID**. This is useful if you want to send different transaction sets to different endpoints. For example, you could send 850 Purchase Orders to one endpoint and 860 Purchase Order Change Requests to another.
2. (Optional) Choose a **Partnership ID**. This is useful if you want to send transactions from different partners to different endpoints. For example, you could send transactions from Walmart to one endpoint and transactions from Target to another. This is less common.
3. (Optional) Select a **Guide**. This is useful if you want to send transactions parsed using different guides to different endpoints. For example, you may receive `005010` 850 Purchase Orders from two different retailers, and those retailers have different guides. Since the transaction payloads will differ, you may want to send them to different API endpoints within your system.
4. (Optional) You can configure the following **Advanced** settings:
   * **Connection:** This is useful when you are using multiple connections for a single partnership. For example, you may have set up one connection type for test data and a separate connection for production data.
   * **Mode:** Specify the type of data Stedi is sending to the destination. You can choose from **Test** or **Production**.
5. (Optional) Select a **Guide** + **Mapping**. This is useful if you want to send transactions parsed using different guides to the same endpoint. For example, you may receive `005010` 850 Purchase Orders from two different retailers, and those retailers have different guides. Since the transaction payloads will differ, you can [choose a mapping](#transform-data-with-mappings) to convert the 850s to your API shape.
   {" "}
   <Tip>
     If you plan to [add a mapping](#transform-data-with-mappings) to this event
     binding, you must select a guide. When you add a mapping, you are only able
     to select a mapping that uses the same guide as a `source`.
   </Tip>

## Transform data with mappings

Stedi integrations use [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json), a JSON format that closely reflects the structure of an EDI transaction. You may need to reshape transaction data from Guide JSON format into the shape required for the target API. For example, you may need to rename fields, add or remove fields, or change the data type of a field.

You can use the [Mappings module](/edi-platform/mappings/index) to transform your payload into the required shape before sending it to a destination.

### Size limits

Two size limits must be met for Stedi to both deliver the event and include the transaction data in the event payload.

1. The enriched event must be less than 4 MB when Stedi passes it to the mapping.
2. The mapping output must be under 1MB.

![Destination and mappings size limits](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/events/size-limits.svg)

If either of these size limits fails, Stedi considers the event delivery a failure and adds the event to the destination's error queue. Instead, you can:

* Use [fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) to split the transaction payload into smaller chunks before sending it to a destination.
* Use the [Map Transaction Output](/api-reference/edi-platform/get-map-transaction-output) endpoint to retrieve processed, mapped transaction data from Stedi.

### Add a Stedi mapping

<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

To add a mapping:

1. Use the [mappings editor](https://portal.stedi.com/app/mappings) to create a transformation for the event. You must choose the event when creating the source schema. Refer to the [mappings documentation](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/ui-guide) for instructions.
2. Select the mapping in the **Mapping** menu when creating your event binding. You will only be able to select mappings that use the same guide you selected in the event binding.

Stedi will apply the mapping to the event data before sending it to the destination.


# Destinations error handling and limitations
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/destinations/error-handling-destinations



<Warning> Destinations is a legacy feature. It is not deprecated, but it has been superseded by [Webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index). Please [contact support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) with questions.</Warning>

[Destination webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/destinations/configure-destinations) allow you to send data from Stedi to third-party services without writing any custom code.

## Limitations

Destinations has certain limitations. If your system's API has different requirements, you can set the destination target to be:

* A function, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions, which can then call the third-party API
* An iPaaS platform, such as Zapier or Workato, which can then call the third-party API.

## HTTP response codes

Stedi considers a 2xx response a success, and marks any other response as a failure.

Stedi retries events associated with status codes other than `2xx` for up to 5 hours.

In the event of an error response (after the retry period), Stedi adds the event to the [error queue](#error-queue) for the destination.

To prevent throttling, you can set a **Max executions per second** when [configuring the destination](/edi-platform/configure/destinations/configure-destinations#create-destination).

## Response time

The target endpoint must respond within 5 seconds, or the event will be counted as a failed delivery.

## Retries

When a destination delivery fails, Stedi will retry up to 5 times every 90 seconds. After the fifth retry, Stedi moves the event to the error queue.

## Error queue

Each destination includes an error queue. Each item in the queue consists of the original event that was attempted to be delivered. This ensures if the target service has some downtime, or anything else goes wrong, the missed events can be retried later. The error queue retains items for 14 days.

Viewing the HTTP response from the third-party service is not currently supported.

The order of the error queue is not guaranteed. The downstream service must be designed to be idempotent to handle at-least-once delivery of events, and must accept events out of order.

## Logs

To view logs, click the Destination to go to its detail page, and then navigate to the **Logs** tab.

## Deauthorized connections

If a destination sends a message to an endpoint that returns a 401 (Unauthorized) response, or the OAuth endpoint returns an error, the destination will be 'deauthorized'. In this state, the destination won't be able to deliver messages.

If there is an issue with your authentication information (such as the password, API key, or OAuth settings), edit the destination to fix it.

If the authentication information is correct, and there was a different reason for the endpoint returning a 401, you can try again by adding a temporary header. Edit the destination, and under the advanced toggle, add any header and value. For example, `x-stedi-reauthorize` with today's date as a value. When you save, the destination will attempt to deliver again. This header can be removed later. Editing the value of a header will also restart deliveries.

You will likely have a queue of messages to deliver, so after making this change they will start automatically being retried. If the endpoint is still returning an invalid response, the destination will return to `Deauthorized`


# Destinations overview

<Warning> Destinations is a legacy feature. It is not deprecated, but it has been superseded by [Webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index). Please [contact support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) with questions.</Warning>

Each time you receive an EDI file from a trading partner, you will want to send the included transactions to your downstream system for processing. You can do this by configuring a Destination webhook. Destination webhooks allow you to send data from Stedi to third-party services without writing any custom code.

The most common use case is sending processed transaction data to your internal systems and business applications. You can also configure webhooks for other [Stedi events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types), like when a processing error occurs. This can be used to trigger alerts in systems like Slack, PagerDuty, or Zendesk for further review.

Stedi can send webhooks to:

* Custom applications using Basic, OAuth, or API Key authorization
* Cloud functions, including AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions
* iPaaS platforms, such as Zapier, Workato, or Tray.io
* ERPs like NetSuite, SAP, or Oracle.


# EDI settings
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/global-settings



You can configure the following behavior from the [EDI Settings](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/settings) page. These settings apply to every partnership in your Stedi account.

## Inbound AS2

You can enable Inbound AS2 if you need to receive files from trading partners using an [AS2 connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2). This isn't necessary if you are only sending outbound files over AS2.

## Inbound processing concurrency

Inbound processing concurrency lets you configure the number of inbound files Stedi processes at once. The concurrency limit applies across all partnerships within your Stedi account.

The default inbound concurrency limit is 25 files. If you need to process more files at once, [contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact), and we can increase the limit for your account.

## Remote SFTP/FTPS static IP address

Enabling a static IP address ensures that your [Remote SFTP/FTPS connections](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/remote-ftp) always use the same source IP address when communicating with remote servers. You can share this IP address with partners who require this additional level of access control.

If your partners don’t require a static IP address, we recommend leaving this setting as disabled.

## Automatic data removal

<Note>
  This functionality is available for Enterprise accounts. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

Artifacts refer to the transaction and file execution payloads from files Stedi has processed. They contain the actual input/output transaction data in EDI, JSON, or another format. Artifacts do not include the metadata about a transaction or file execution, such as whether it was processed successfully.

You may want Stedi to remove artifacts after a certain timeframe - for example, to comply with your company's PII/PHI retention policies. You can configure the artifact retention period in **Automatic data removal**.

Once you set a retention period, Stedi deletes artifacts after the retention window has passed. **This affects both existing and future data in your account.**

For example, if you set a retention period of 30 days and process a file today, Stedi will delete the artifact after 30 total days have elapsed. Stedi will also delete any artifact that was created more than 30 days prior. **Stedi deletes historical files outside the retention window immediately upon configuring the retention period.** In this example, Stedi would not delete an artifact that was processed less than 30 days prior.

<Warning>You cannot recover deleted artifacts.</Warning>


# Configuration overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/index



You need the following configuration for each new trading partner.

![Inbound and Outbound file processing flow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/diagrams/stedi-flow.svg)

## Partnership

A [partnership](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/profiles-and-partnerships) defines the EDI relationship between you and your trading partner.

Inside your partnership, you'll define all of the configuration specific to exchanging files with your partner, including the connection protocol, transaction settings, whether to send automatic acknowledgments, and more.

## Connection

A [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/index) configures the protocol you'll use to exchange files with your partner. This can be SFTP/FTPS or AS2.

Stedi automatically processes inbound files your partner sends over the connection. When you call Stedi's API to generate an outbound EDI file, Stedi automatically delivers it to your partner through the connection you configure for the partnership.

## Transaction settings

You'll create a [transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) for each EDI transaction type you plan to send or receive.

Transaction settings tell Stedi which [guide](/edi-platform/guides) (EDI requirements) to use for the transaction type.

* For inbound transactions, Stedi uses the attached guide to validate and translate the EDI into JSON.
* For outbound transactions, Stedi uses the guide to validate the JSON payload you submit to the API and then generate a fully-formed EDI file.

## Webhooks

[Webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index) are one of the most important integration points with the Stedi platform. They allow you to automatically send events from Stedi to any external API.

You'll configure at least one webhook to send `transaction.processed.v2` events to your business system. Then, you can programatically retrieve the processed transaction data from Stedi.


# Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs)
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-mdn-response



AS2 supports MDN (message disposition notification), a way for your partner to acknowledge that they have received your message. Some partners may require that you request and accept an MDN response, send MDN responses, or both.

## What is an MDN?

An MDN (Message Disposition Notification) serves as a receipt to acknowledge that a message has been received and can verify various aspects of the message's integrity and authenticity.

You or your trading partners may request MDNs for the following reasons:

* **Acknowledge receipt:** An MDN serves as a verifiable acknowledgment that a message has been received by the trading partner's system.
* **Security**: If the sent message was signed, the MDN allows the sender to confirm that the receiving system has authenticated the sender and verified the message's integrity.
* **Non-Repudiation:** MDNs provide evidence that a message has been both received and processed, which can be essential in dispute resolution or auditing scenarios.

According the AS2 specification, MDNs can either be synchronous (provided on the same connection as the HTTP request) or asynchronous (sent separately after the initial HTTP request), depending on the requirements of a given partnership.

## Configure MDNs

For outbound messages, Stedi only supports accepting synchronous MDNs, so you need to tell your partner to send synchronous MDNs if they wish to send an MDN response. Visit [Requirements](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-requirements#with-an-mdn-response-requested) for configuration details.

For inbound messages, Stedi automatically sends MDNs when requested. Stedi delivers MDNs either asynchronously or synchronously, depending on the specified parameters in your partner’s request. Visit [Requirements](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-requirements#with-an-mdn-response-returned) for configuration details.

## View MDN responses

To view the MDN response associated with a file:

1. Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page and click the file to view its details.
2. Click **Connection deliveries**.
3. Under **MDN Status** click **View file**.

You can review the contents of the MDN response and optionally download it to your machine.


# AS2 Connections
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-overview



The AS2 protocol is a popular protocol for securely exchanging EDI files. Stedi provides fully-managed AS2 connections that take care of the intricacies of AS2 and scale automatically to meet your demand.

## About AS2

You can technically use AS2 to exchange any type of file, but it is not commonly used outside of EDI.

AS2 and its predecessor, AS1, were designed to facilitate the secure exchange of business transactions using digital certificates and encryption prior to the popularization of HTTPS. AS2 was formalized in 2005 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in [RFC 4130](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4130). Despite the fact that HTTPS is now the de facto standard for secure message exchange, AS2 is still widely used throughout the business world. Modern AS2 connections, including those in the Stedi platform, can use both HTTP and HTTPS as the underlying transport protocol. The requirements for AS2 setup differ depending on whether you use HTTP or HTTPS.

Setting up an AS2 connection with a partner involves generating one or more public-private key pairs for use in encrypting and signing messages. Your partner will also need to generate their own key pairs, and then you and your partner will need to exchange public keys and agree upon an encryption algorithm.

## View connection logs

You can view and filter logs for each AS2 connection. You can view three types of logs:

* **Provisioning:** These logs detail each step to create or update the connection, such as provisioning the certificates, making it easier to diagnose errors.
* **Inbound:** These logs detail each file that your partner sends to you over the connection.
* **Outbound:** These logs detail each file that you generate and send to your partner over the connection.

To view logs, go to the partnership associated with the connection and click the connection to view its details page.

## Known limitations

* Server-side TCP keep-alive is not supported. The connection times out after 350 seconds of inactivity unless the client sends keep-alive packets.
* If an inbound message does not contain valid AS2 headers, it will not appear in the logs.
* Multiple attachments and certificate exchange messaging (CEM) from AS2 version 1.2 are not currently supported.
* For outbound messages, your partner's server must support the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) algorithm protection attribute for validating message signatures, as defined in [RFC 6211](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6211). This is not supported in certain older IBM Sterling products.
* For outbound messages over HTTPS, your partner's endpoint must support the TLS version 1.2 protocol and one of the following cryptographic algorithms:

  * `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
  * `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
  * `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`
  * `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
  * `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
  * `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
  * `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`
  * `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
  * `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`
  * `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256`


# AS2 requirements
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-requirements



There is certain base-level information that you will always need to exchange with
your partner prior to setting up an AS2 connection:

| Item                                                                                                             | Usage                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Your partner's AS2 ID                                                                                            | Required                           |
| [Your AS2 ID](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/configure-as2#choose-your-as2-identifier) | Required                           |
| Your partner's AS2 server URL                                                                                    | Required if sending AS2 messages   |
| [Your AS2 server URL](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/settings)                                                | Required if receiving AS2 messages |

The rest of the information you need to exchange with your partner depends on the scenario(s) you want to support, and your partner's requirements. The following scenarios help you understand how AS2 works and how you can use it to exchange transactions with your trading partners.

## Send AS2 messages to a partner

For outbound AS2 messages, the configuration requirements differ depending on several factors:

* Whether your partner's server uses HTTP or HTTPS
* Whether your partner requires you to sign your messages
* Whether your partner requires you to accept an MDN response

### Using HTTP without encryption

If your partner's server URL starts with `http://`, Stedi will send messages to your partner using standard HTTP. Since HTTP does not support encryption natively, Stedi must encrypt your messages according to the AS2 protocol before sending them to your partner.

The following table shows the configuration information you need to send AS2 messages to a partner over HTTP.

| Item                                         | Usage    | Comments                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Your partner's public encryption certificate | Required |                                                                                             |
| Your partner's encryption algorithm          | Required | Must be `AES128_CBC`, `AES192_CBC`, or `AES256_CBC`                                         |
| Your partner's certificate chain             | Optional | Required if your partner certificate was issued by a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) |
| Your public encryption certificate           | Not used |                                                                                             |
| Your private encryption key                  | Not used |                                                                                             |

In this scenario, Stedi uses your partner's public encryption certificate and specified encryption algorithm to encrypt the message. Stedi then sends the encrypted message to your partner's server over HTTP, and your partner uses their private key to decrypt the message.

### Using HTTPS without signing

If your partner's server URL starts with `https://`, Stedi will send messages to your partner using HTTPS. Data transferred over HTTPS is natively encrypted, but some partners may also require you to encrypt the payload using AS2.

The following table shows the information you need to send AS2 messages to a partner over HTTP.

| Item                                         | Usage    | Comments                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Your partner's public encryption certificate | Optional |                                                                                             |
| Your partner's encryption algorithm          | Optional | If used, must be `AES128_CBC`, `AES192_CBC`, or `AES256_CBC`                                |
| Your partner's certificate chain             | Optional | Required if your partner certificate was issued by a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) |
| Your public encryption certificate           | Not used |                                                                                             |
| Your private encryption key                  | Not used |                                                                                             |

In this scenario, Stedi will use your partner's public encryption certificate (if provided) and specified encryption algorithm to encrypt the message payload according to the AS2 protocol. Stedi then sends the encrypted payload to your partner's server over HTTPS (which includes a layer of encryption). Your partner will decrypt the HTTPS request and the AS2 payload using private keys.

### Using HTTP or HTTPS with signing

Certain trading partners may also require you to sign your messages. Message signing allow partners to verify that your message is authentic and has not been tampered with. This is done by generating a public-private key pair and then sharing your public key with your partner. Your partner will then use your public key to verify that the message was sent by you.

Stedi will automatically sign your messages if you upload a signing certificate to your local profile.

Additional configuration:

| Item                              | Usage    | Comments                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Your public signing certificate   | Required |                                                                                     |
| Your private signing key          | Required |                                                                                     |
| Your certificate chain            | Optional | Required if your certificate was issued by a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) |
| Your partner's public certificate | Not used |                                                                                     |

### With an MDN response requested

Some partners may require that you request and accept an [MDN response](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-mdn-response). If your partner signs their MDNs, you will need to import your partner's public signing certificate into Stedi to verify the MDN.

MDNs can be sent synchronously or asynchronously. For outbound messages, Stedi only supports accepting synchronous MDNs, so you need to tell your partner to send synchronous MDNs if they wish to send an MDN response.

Additional configuration:

| Item                                      | Usage    | Comments                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Your partner's public signing certificate | Optional | Required if your partner signs MDNs                                                         |
| Your partner's certificate chain          | Optional | Required if your partner certificate was issued by a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) |
| Your partner's MDN signing algorithm      | Required | Can be `None`, `SHA1`, `SHA256`, `SHA384`, or `SHA512`                                      |

## Receive AS2 messages from a partner

Receiving AS2 messages from a partner is similar to sending messages to a partner, but the process is reversed. In this case, your partner sends messages to Stedi's AS2 server, and you must provide them with the connection information.

Stedi's AS2 servers use HTTP, and therefore require that your partner encrypts their messages according to the AS2 protocol.

The following table shows the information needed for setting up an inbound AS2 connection.

| Item                                                              | Usage    | Comments                                                                            | Exchange with partner |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Your public encryption certificate                                | Required | Must be 2048-bit or 4096-bit RSA                                                    | Yes                   |
| Your private encryption key                                       | Required | Must be 2048-bit or 4096-bit RSA                                                    | No                    |
| Your certificate chain                                            | Optional | Required if your certificate was issued by a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) | Yes                   |
| Your encryption algorithm                                         | Required | `AES128_CBC`, `AES192_CBC`, `AES256_CBC`, `3DES`                                    | Yes                   |
| [Your AS2 server URL](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/settings) | Required |                                                                                     | Yes                   |

In this scenario, your partner uses your public encryption certificate and specified encryption algorithm to encrypt the message payload. Your partner then sends the encrypted payload to Stedi's server over HTTP, and Stedi uses your private key to decrypt the payload.

### With signing

Certain trading partners may also require that you verify the authenticity and integrity of their messages using their signature. Your partner will generate a public-private key pair and then share their public key with you. When you upload this key to Stedi, Stedi uses it to verify that your partner was the party that sent the message.

Additional configuration:

| Your partner's certificate chain          | Optional | Required if your partner certificate was issued by a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) |

### With an MDN response returned

Your partner may request that you send an [MDN response](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-mdn-response) acknowledging that you have received their message. Stedi automatically sends MDNs when requested in an inbound message and delivers them either asynchronously or synchronously, depending on the specified parameters in your partner's request.

Your trading partner's requests may specify that MDN responses should be signed. If a signed MDN is requested and you have imported your public and private signing keys, Stedi signs the MDN using the algorithm specified in the request. If you have not imported your signing keys, Stedi returns an unsigned MDN, as per RFC 4130 section 7.3.1.

Additional configuration:

| Item                            | Usage    | Comments                                                                            |

# Configure AS2 connections
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/configure-as2



Once you have gathered the [required setup information](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-requirements),
you can configure your Stedi AS2 connection.

## Choose your AS2 identifier

The AS2 protocol requires that the sender and receiver provide each other with AS2 IDs to help identify and route transactions during the AS2 file exchange process.

Your partner will provide their AS2 ID during the onboarding process.

There is no central authority that registers or tracks AS2 IDs, so you can choose any value you like. You should choose a value that is unlikely to be used by other companies. It's common to use the same value that you chose for [your ISA ID](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/profiles-and-partnerships#create-local-profiles) when you created your Local profile.

An AS2 ID must be between 1-128 printable ASCII characters (except double quote or backslash), and is case sensitive. It's customary to use all capitalized letters and include no spaces.

## Create an AS2 connection

Creating an AS2 connection provisions all the resources required to send and receive data using the AS2 protocol. You can only create one AS2 connection per partnership.

To create an AS2 connection:

1. Go to the **Trading partners** page.
2. Click the partnership where you want to add the connection.
3. Click **Create connection**.
4. Select **AS2** as the **Connection type**.
5. Enter a **Connection name**.
6. Enter your **AS2 ID** as the **Local AS2 profile identifier**.
7. (Optional) Under Local profile signing credentials you can upload the three different certificates required:
   * **Certificate:** Your public signing certificate
   * **Private Key:** Your private signing key
   * **Certificate chain:** Only required if you are using certificates and keys generated by a trusted certificate authority (CA)
8. (Optional) By default, your **Local profile encryption credentials** use the same data you supplied for your local signing credentials. If you are using different certificate and key for encryption, toggle **Same as signing credentials** to **OFF** and supply: -**Certificate:** Your public encryption certificate
   * **Private Key:** Your private encryption key
   * **Certificate chain:** Only required if you are using certificates and keys generated by a trusted certificate authority (CA)
9. Enter your trading partner's AS2 ID as the **Partner AS2 profile identifier**.
10. (Optional) Under **Partner profile signing credentials**, you can upload the two different certificates:
    * **Certificate:** Your trading partners’ signing certificate
    * **Certificate chain:** Only required when your trading partners are using certificates and keys generated by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
11. (Optional) By default, the **Partner profile encryption credentials** use the same data you supplied for your partner signing credentials. If your trading partner is using a different certificate and key for encryption, toggle **Same as signing credentials** to **OFF** and supply:
    * **Certificate:** Your trading partner's public encryption certificate
    * **Certificate chain:** Only required when your trading partner is using certificates and keys generated by a trusted certificate authority (CA)
12. (Optional) If you plan to send data to your trading partner, set the **Enable AS2 outbound** to **ON** and enter the **Partner AS2 server URL**, the **MDN response**, and **Encryption algorithm**.
    * (Optional) If your trading partner requires **Basic authentication**, click **Advanced** > **Enable basic access authentication**, and enter the **Username** and **Password**.
13. (Optional) If you plan to receive data from your trading partner, set the **Enable AS2 inbound** to **ON** and enter the **Encryption algorithm**. Note that if this is the first time you are enabling inbound AS2, you must click **Enable inbound AS2** and wait for the server to be provisioned before you can finish creating the connection. This process provisions a unique server URL for you to share with your partners.
14. Click **Create connection**.
    You must have enabled one or both of the Inbound or Outbound sections, before you can create the connection.

## Certificates and keys

Before you configure your AS2 connection, you need to prepare the certificates that you will use. This involves generating your own certificates as well as requesting certificates from your trading partner.

A certificate consists of both a public key and a private key. In AS2, there are two types of certificates:

* **Signing certificate:** This certificate allows you and your partners to verify the message sender's identity.
* **Encryption certificate:** This certificate allows you and your trading partners to encrypt and decrypt messages.

Some partners require two certificates – one for signing and one for encryption. Others may want you to use the same certificate for both tasks. For example, Walmart's AS2 portal only asks you to upload a single certificate. Follow the instructions from your trading partner when defining your AS2 configuration.

If either you or your partner are using a certificate issued by a third-party Certificate Authority (CA), you can skip the certificate creation steps and use the provided certificate and key directly.

<Info>
  If you are sending files to a trading partner's HTTPS endpoint, you must use
  an SSL certificate signed by a publicly-trusted certificate authority (CA).
  Self-signed certificates for HTTPS are not currently supported.
</Info>

Certificates with the following cryptographic algorithms and key sizes are supported:

* 2048-bit RSA
* 4096-bit RSA

### Convert certificates and keys between formats

The format in which the encryption materials are provided to you by your trading partner may be different than the PEM format that Stedi AS2 requires. You can use OpenSSL utilities to convert certificates and keys between different formats.

Convert `CRT` to `PEM`:

`openssl x509 -in cert.crt -out cert.pem`

Convert `CER` to `PEM`:

`openssl x509 -in cert.cer -out cert.pem`

Convert `DER` to `PEM`:

`openssl x509 -in cert.der -out cert.pem`

### Create your signing and encryption certificates

If your trading partner requires unique certificates for signing and encryption, run the command twice. For each run, change the key names to indicate whether they are for signing or encryption. For example, use `acme-signing-private.pem` for the first run and `acme-encryption-private.pem` for the second run.

Create a new certificate. The `-days` option specifies the number of days the certificate will remain valid.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout <PRIVATE_KEY_NAME>.pem \
    -out <PUBLIC_KEY_NAME>.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes
```

Enter information to identify your organization. You don’t need to fill out all the fields, but you should specify what you can.

## Static IP addresses

All AS2 connections in your Stedi account use the same set of static IP addresses for outbound EDI. If you need to allowlist these addresses, please [contact customer success](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for a full list.


# Bucket Connections
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/buckets



<Note>
  Please [contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) if you need access to this
  feature.
</Note>

For advanced use cases that other connection types can't cover, Stedi offers bucket connections.

<Warning>
  We recommend using other connection types when possible. If you think your use
  case requires a bucket connection, reach out to
  [support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for help setting it up.
</Warning>

To create a bucket connection:

1. Select **Bucket** as the **Connection Type**.
2. Enter a descriptive **Connection name**.
3. Select a **root path**. This is the directory in which the inbound and outbound transaction directories will be created. Stedi will automatically suggest a root path based on the partnership ID. You can change this if needed.
4. Choose an inbound directory name that identifies where inbound files should be retrieved for processing.
5. Choose an outbound directory name that identifies where outbound files should be placed when created.
6. Click the **Create connection** to save the connection. You can now associate this connection with one or more [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings).


# Choosing a connection type
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/choosing-the-right-connection-type



Often, your trading partner will request that you set up a specific type of connection protocol. However, it's important to understand the pros and cons of each approach.

## Connection recommendations

We recommend the following in order of most preferred to least preferred:

1. **[Stedi-run SFTP/FTPS](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/stedi-ftp):** This connection type is extremely simple to set up and requires no ongoing maintenance. Outbound files sent to partners using Stedi SFTP are instantly available for partners to pick up. Inbound file processing is event-driven, and Stedi processes files instantly upon receipt. Stedi SFTP scales virtually infinitely. However, most large trading partners are unwilling to connect to external SFTP servers and require that you connect to their server instead.
2. **[Remote SFTP/FTPS](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/remote-ftp):** Stedi can also connect to partner or third-party SFTP/FTPS/FTP servers. Stedi delivers outbound files to your trading partners instantly and processes inbound files on a polling schedule. By default, Stedi polls every 5 minutes, but you can set a custom polling interval in the connection's configuration settings.
3. **[AS2](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-overview):** For partners that are unable to connect over SFTP, Stedi offers a hosted AS2 option. The AS2 protocol comes with serious drawbacks, so we recommend only using it as a last resort. **If your partner requests AS2 connectivity, we strongly recommend asking if SFTP is an option instead.**

## Problems with AS2

AS2 has several significant drawbacks:

* It is tedious to set up and requires getting complex, unfamiliar configuration settings just right. Debugging AS2 connection issues often involves getting both parties on a call to dive into detailed logs to figure out what is preventing the complex series of handshakes from completing successfully.

* It requires generating, distributing, and regularly updating certificates on an ongoing basis. This process can be labor-intensive and requires meticulous management and coordination with trading partners. Any lapse in the process leads to transaction processing downtime.

* Once set up, AS2 servers are typically inefficient at processing large files and high transaction volume.

### Why trading partners still want AS2

Regardless of its drawbacks, trading partners – particularly in the retail space – often push for AS2 as a preferred connection type. There are several reasons for this preference.

* **Historical:** When AS2 was first developed, it was positioned as way to move from closed, proprietary VANs (Value-Added Networks) to internet-based EDI. AS2 provided a way for retailers and suppliers to circumvent VANs and connect directly. Many retailers today still associate AS2 with "direct connectivity," despite the fact that SFTP provides a functionally identical but more modern mechanism.

* **Real-time communication:** There's a perception amongst retailers that AS2 connections are faster than SFTP. When an AS2 message is sent from one a retailer to its supplier, the supplier's AS2 server receives the message in real-time. In contrast, when a retailer places a file on its SFTP server, it's up to the supplier to pick up the file at their own discretion. Many legacy EDI platforms are unable to poll faster than 30 minute intervals, which slows down the flow of transactions. By default, Stedi polls for files at 5-minute intervals, and can poll as often as once per minute (though we don't recommend a one-minute interval because retailer SFTP servers are often quite slow and the poller can't finish processing the first polling request by the time the second request is initiated).

### Why we recommend SFTP instead

Modern data transmission technologies have now made many AS2 features obsolete. For the following reasons, we strongly recommend using SFTP instead of AS2 when possible.

* **Security:** SFTP, built on SSH (Secure Shell), provides robust encryption and secure data transfer capabilities. This makes the encryption aspect of AS2 less unique, as SFTP offers similar security features.

* **Authentication:** SFTP supports strong authentication mechanisms and ensures data integrity during transfer. This diminishes the advantages of AS2 digital signature and MDN features.

* **Ease of use and maintenance:** SFTP is generally considered easier to implement and maintain - there are no certificates to update or MDNs to manage.

* **Network compatibility:** SFTP is widely compatible with various network configurations and firewalls, making it more adaptable across different IT environments than AS2.

* **Performance and scalability:** SFTP tends to be more performant and scalable, especially for larger files or higher volumes of data transfer.


# Connections overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/index



You can use Connections to exchange EDI files with trading partners via SFTP, FTPS, FTP, or AS2.

## Prerequisites

Before adding a connection, you need to set up a [partnership](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/profiles-and-partnerships).

## Create a connection

To create a connection:

1. Go to the [**Trading partners**](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page.
2. Click the partnership where you want to add the connection.
3. Click **Create connection**.
4. Select the desired **Connection type**.

### Connection types

The available connection types are [Stedi SFTP/FTPS](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/stedi-ftp), [Remote SFTP/FTPS](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/remote-ftp), and [AS2](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2).

The connection type you choose depends on your and your trading partner's requirements. Visit [Choosing a connection type](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/choosing-the-right-connection-type) for our recommendations and details about the pros and cons of each type.

### Inbound file encoding

By default, Stedi generates EDI files with UTF-8 encoding and assumes UTF-8 encoding for inbound files.

However, some trading partners may send files containing extended Latin characters, such as `ä`, `é` or `ñ`. Files with Latin characters may be encoded in an **extended** ASCII encoding, such as Windows-1252. In these cases, you should specify the appropriate file encoding to ensure Stedi interprets the data correctly.

To set the file encoding for inbound EDI files, click a connection to go to its details page. In **Inbound settings** choose a **File encoding** format. Stedi supports UTF-8 and Windows-1252.

<Note>
  UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII-encoded files and suitable for most
  cases. We recommend leaving this setting as the default unless your trading
  partner tells you otherwise.
</Note>

## Next steps

After you create a connection, we recommend creating [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) that define the EDI transactions you plan to exchange with your trading partner.


# Remote SFTP/FTPS Connections
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/remote-ftp



Stedi connects to an external SFTP, FTP, FTPS server to exchange files with your trading partner. This could either be a server that your trading partner hosts, or a server that you host outside of Stedi on existing infrastructure. This is the most common connection type to use, since most large trading partners will require you to connect to their server instead of using yours.

Your trading partner will provide you with the connection information required to set up the connection. This typically includes the server address, port, username, and password or private key.

## Create Remote SFTP/FTPS connections

To create a Remote SFTP/FTPS connection:

1. Select **Remote SFTP/FTPS** as the **Connection Type**.

2. Enter the **Host** (the remote server address) and specify the **Port**.

3. Enter authentication credentials. Enter a **Username**, and either a **Password** or a **private key** from your local machine.

4. Specify the **Root directory** to use in the remote server.

5. Stedi will automatically suggest an internal **Connection name**. This is never visible to your trading partner and is used for unique identification with your Stedi account only. If the name that's suggested isn't sensible to you, you can change it to anything you wish. You cannot edit the name after it has been created.

6. (Optional) Use the **Advanced** menu if you need to specify the number of **Retries**, the **Connection timeout**, the **Socket timeout**, and **SFTP algorithms** to use.
   > **Note:** We recommend using the default settings for the majority of use cases. Contact [support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) if you are unsure what settings to use and we'd be happy to help you figure out the right settings.

7. Configure **Inbound settings**.

   * Set the remote directory where Stedi should retrieve inbound EDI files from your partner. You can use the suggested default if your partner has not provided a specific directory. Stedi only looks for files in this specific directory, it does not search for files within sub-directories.

   * Use the toggles to set:
     * How often to poll the remote server
     * Whether to retrieve only new files created since the last fetch
     * Whether to delete files after retrieval.

8. (Optional) Set a **Filter pattern** (regex expression) that Stedi will use to retrieve and process files. Stedi only processes files that match the regex criteria.

9. (Optional) Choose a **File encoding** format. We recommend leaving this as UTF-8 unless you know your partner will be sending files with a different encoding type.

10. Set the the remote directory in **Outbound settings** where Stedi should put generated EDI files for your partner to retrieve. You can use the suggested default if your partner has not provided a specific directory.

11. Click **Create connection** to save the connection.

You can now associate this connection with one or more [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) and use it to exchange files with your trading partner.

## Shared connections

Stedi supports shared remote SFTP/FTPS connections, which allow you to use the same remote server across multiple partnerships. How you configure shared connections depends on your use case.

### Different directory per partner

If each trading partner adds files to a distinct directory on the server, configure the remote SFTP/FTPS connections on each partnership to poll the appropriate directory.

### Single directory for all partners

If all of your trading partners use the same root directory on the remote server, we recommend the following configuration:

1. Create remote SFTP/FTPS connections in each partnership with automatic polling disabled.
2. Create a separate partnership between your local profile and a new partner profile called `REMOTESFTP` or `REMOTEFTPS`.
3. Add a remote SFTP/FTPS connection to the new partnership and configure it to poll the shared remote server. You do not need to configure any other settings within the partnership.

This configuration allows you to easily identify which partnership's connection is polling, making debugging easier.

When Stedi polls the remote server, it automatically retrieves and processes all files that match the [filter pattern](#filter-pattern-for-inbound-files) (if set). During processing, Stedi first associates a file with the correct partnership and then processes the file according to that partnership's transaction settings. This process allows Stedi to process all files on the remote server, even if they are not associated with the partnership connection doing the polling.

## Test the connection

We recommend testing your connection immediately after creation to ensure you can connect to the remote server. To test the connection:

1. Go to the Partnership and click the **ellipses (...)** next to the SFTP/FTPS connection.
2. Select **Test**.
3. Stedi will attempt to connect to the remote SFTP/FTPS server using the credentials provided in your connection and will show a success or error message accordingly.

## Fetch files manually

You can disable automatic polling and retrieve files manually when needed. For example, you may want to retrieve files manually when testing or troubleshooting the connection.

To manually fetch files:

1. Go to the Partnership and click the **ellipses (...)** next to the connection.
2. Select **Fetch now**.

## Filter pattern for inbound files

You can specify a **Filter pattern** (regex expression) for Stedi to use when retrieving inbound files from the Remote SFTP/FTPS connection. When polling the remote server, Stedi only processes files that match the filter pattern.

For example, your trading partner may place files for multiple different entities on the remote server, with different prefixes for each entity. In this case, you could write a regex expression that matches only files with a given prefix.

To validate that the expression matches your expectations, you can **Fetch files manually** or wait until the next automatic polling attempt.

### Use cases

When you configure a remote FTP connection, you can define a polling interval. If there are files on the remote server under the `inbound` directory that you do **NOT** want to bring over to Stedi when polling, you can define a filter pattern to limit the files that Stedi processes. This is useful when you want to store other file types for different purposes in the folder you have selected to poll. For example, you might store CSV files, images, PDFs, etc.

In rare instances, your trading partner might **require** you to configure the inbound subdirectory to be the same as the outbound subdirectory. In this case, it is important that you configure a filter pattern to prevent Stedi from ingesting and processing the outbound files you send to your trading partner. Your filter pattern should identify the naming structure you expect to receive from the trading partner, and you need to make sure that this structure is sufficiently different from the naming structure you use for sending outbound files.

### Example

The following expression matches a filename like `INTERCHANGE-GROUP-20231115154001-681896da.edi`, and would prevent Stedi from processing files with names like `INTERCHANGE-681896da.edi` or `681896da.x12`.

`^(?<ISA>\w+)-(?<GS>\w+)-(?<timestamp>\d+)-(?<unique>\w+).edi$`

## Status and logs

Each Remote SFTP/FTPS connection's status and logs can be found on its overview page. To view the overview page, go to the partnership and click the connection's name.

An **Available** connection status indicates that Stedi is able to connect to the remote server.

The **Logs** detail each connection and polling attempt.

## Static IPs

Enabling a static IP address ensures that your Remote SFTP/FTPS connections always use the same source IP address when communicating with a remote server. This may be required if one or more of your trading partners need to add your IP address to an allowlist to enable access.

You can enable a static IP address from the [EDI Settings](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/settings) page.


# Stedi SFTP/FTPS Connections
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/stedi-ftp



Stedi creates and hosts a fully-managed server that supports both SFTP and FTPS protocols, along with user credentials you can provide to your trading partner. Your trading partner can use their credentials to connect to the server through either SFTP (using port 22), or FTPS (using port 21).

Once you configure the connection, Stedi automatically ingests and processes any files that your trading partner adds to the server and automatically places outbound EDI files on the server for your trading partner to retrieve.

This is the easiest way to get started exchanging EDI files with the least amount of configuration. However, your trading partner may require you to use their server instead, especially if they are the larger party.

<Tip>
  The Stedi SFTP/FTPS connection type supports only username and password
  authentication. If your trading partner requires key-based authentication, you
  can use a [Remote SFTP/FTPS
  connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/remote-ftp)
  instead.
</Tip>

## Create SFTP/FTPS connections

To create a Stedi SFTP/FTPS connection:

1. Select **SFTP/FTPS** as the **Connection type**.
2. Enter a **Connection name**.
3. If required, provide a specific length for the autogenerated password.
4. Specify an **Inbound directory**. This is the directory that your trading partner will use to send files to you. Any file placed in this directory will be automatically ingested and processed. The default directory is `/inbound` but you can specify a different directory if needed.
5. Specify an **Outbound directory**. This is the directory that your trading partner will use to retrieve files from you. Outbound EDI files will be automatically deposited in this directory. The default directory is `/outbound` but you can specify a different directory if needed.
6. By default, **Delete inbound files on receipt** is selected. Typically, partners want you to delete files after processing. If you want to keep the files, deselect this option.
7. Click **Create connection**. Stedi shows the login credentials for the created user.

<Warning>
  **Important:** The login credentials will only be displayed once and cannot be
  retrieved again for security reasons. We recommend immediately saving the
  login credentials in a secure location such as a password manager. If needed,
  you can always [regenerate new credentials](#regenerate-credentials).
</Warning>

You can now associate this connection with one or more [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) and use it to exchange files with your trading partner.

## Regenerate credentials

To generate new login credentials:

1. Navigate to the **Trading partners** page.
2. Click the partnership that contains the connection whose credentials you want to regenerate.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Under the **Username** field, click **Regenerate credentials**.

## Static IPs

Some partners will need to know Stedi SFTP/FTPS's IP addresses in order to allow internal systems to establish a connection. Stedi SFTP/FTPS uses the following IPs:

`18.119.51.218` and `18.206.132.233`

<Warning>
  These IPs apply only to Stedi-hosted SFTP/FTPS. You can enable different
  static IPs for Remote SFTP/FTPS in [EDI
  Settings](/edi-platform/configure/global-settings).
</Warning>

## Status and details

You can find details about each Stedi SFTP/FTPS connection on its overview page. To view the overview page, navigate to the partnership and click the connection's name.


# Acknowledgments
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/functional-acknowledgments



Your trading partner may send you TA1s in response to outbound EDI files.

You may also need to send your trading partner a TA1 and/or a functional acknowledgment (997 or 999) in response to each inbound EDI file. These acknowledgments confirm that you received the transaction and help your trading partner know everything is working as expected.

Stedi can automatically generate acknowledgments for each inbound transaction and deliver them to your trading partner.

## TA1s

[TA1 Interchange Acknowledgments](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008040/segment/TA1) indicate receipt of an interchange and identify any errors in the interchange's envelope (`ISA` and `IEA`) information.

### Inbound

You don't need to create a transaction setting to receive TA1s from your trading partners. Stedi automatically processes inbound TA1s and displays the data in the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) and [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) pages for inspection.

### Outbound

Stedi can automatically send both positive and negative TA1s in response to inbound transactions from your trading partner. If you specify a connection for automatic acknowledgments, Stedi sends the TA1 to that connection. Otherwise, Stedi sends the TA1 through the connection that received the inbound file.

You can review the TA1s Stedi sends to trading partners on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page in the Stedi portal.

#### Positive TA1s

Positive TA1s contain code `A` in `TA104`, indicating that the interchange was accepted without errors. Stedi will then process the transaction and create a record in the Stedi portal.

Note that a positive TA1 only indicates that Stedi received the interchange and that the interchange envelope does not contain any of the errors that trigger a [negative TA1](#negative-ta1s). The transaction data can still fail Stedi’s validation and processing. For example, your partner could receive a positive TA1 and then a 999 rejection (if configured) for the transaction itself due to non-compliant EDI.

#### Negative TA1s

Stedi only generates negative TA1s for specific errors. If the interchange envelope contains a different error than the ones listed, Stedi still sends a positive TA1 (if configured) so your trading partner can confirm you received the transaction.

Your trading partner may receive the following types of negative TA1s:

* **Accepted with errors:** TA1s with [code `E` in `TA104`](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/TA1#TA1-04) indicate that the interchange was accepted with errors. In these cases, Stedi still proceeds with processing the transaction and creates a record in the Stedi portal. Stedi generates TA1s with code `E` for the following `TA105` error types:
  * `014`: Invalid Interchange Date Value
  * `015`: Invalid Interchange Time Value
* **Rejected because of errors:** TA1s with [code `R` in `TA104`](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/TA1#TA1-04) indicate that the interchange was rejected due to one or more errors. Stedi doesn't process the interchange and doesn't create a record in the Stedi portal. Stedi generates TA1s with code `R` for the following `TA105` error types:
  * `001`: The Interchange Control Number in the Header and Trailer Do Not Match. The Value From the Header is Used in the Acknowledgment
  * `021`: Invalid Number of Included Groups Value | For example, the interchange envelope indicates that there are five functional groups, but only four are present in the interchange.
  * `027`: Invalid Component Element Separator | The data cannot use letters, numbers, whitespace, or the underscore character as a separator between EDI elements.

#### Enable automatic TA1s

To enable autogenerating outbound TA1s for trading partners:

1. Go to the partnership.
2. Click the pencil next to **Acknowledgments**.
3. Select an option under **Interchange Acknowledgments (TA1)**:
   * **Never:** This is the default setting.
   * **When requested**: Stedi sends a TA1 according to the [code provided in `ISA14`](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/ISA#ISA-14). There are four possible codes:
     * `0`: Never send a TA1
     * `1`: Always send a TA1 (positive or negative)
     * `2`: Only send TA1s with code `R` (rejected)
     * `3`: Only send TA1s with code `R` or code `E` (accepted with errors)
   * **Always:** Stedi sends a TA1 for every successful inbound transaction received over a connection within this partnership.
4. Select an existing **Connection** within the partnership where Stedi will deliver generated TA1s.
   * (SFTP/FTPS only) Specify an optional **Subdirectory**. Stedi will deliver generated acknowledgments to this subdirectory. We don't recommend specifying a subdirectory unless your trading partner has instructed you to do so.
5. (Optional) Enter a JSONata expression to set a custom filename for generated acknowledgments. Available JSONata expressions are `& (Concatenation)` and `$millis`. If you do not set a filename, Stedi uses the **File Execution ID**.
6. Click **Save**.

## 997s and 999s

[997 Functional Acknowledgments](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/transaction-set/997) and [999 Implementation Acknowledgments](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/transaction-set/999) are functional acknowledgments that confirm receipt of a transaction and indicate whether it was accepted or rejected. The acknowledgment also provides information about errors in the transaction, if present. While they serve the same basic purpose, 999s are more detailed than 997s and are currently only used in healthcare.

### Inbound

You must create [inbound transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) if your trading partner plans to send you 997 or 999 functional acknowledgments.

### Outbound

When sending outbound functional acknowledgments, you should never return both a 997 and a 999 for a given file. 999s are commonly returned for the following healthcare transaction sets:

* [270 Health Care Eligibility, Coverage or Benefit Inquiry](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-eligibility-benefit-inquiry-x279a1/01GRYB6GTDJ4MEP5Z16CGMQWT6)
* [271 Health Care Eligibility Benefit Response](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-eligibility-benefit-response-x279a1/01GS66YHZPB37ABF34DBPSR213)
* [276 Health Care Claim Status Request](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/claim-status-request-x212/01GRYB6A4XEJQ61Y2K2KT606E5),
* [277 Health Care Information Status Notification](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/transaction-set/277)
* [278 Health Care Services Review Information - Response](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-services-review-information-response-x217/01GRYB6C27KFB6H1M8MVYMQDKK)
* [820 Payroll Deducted and Other Group Premium Payment for Insurance Products Examples](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/payroll-deducted-and-other-group-premium-payment-for-insurance-products-examples-x218/01GRYB6CPB1S1257NJJP6K497B)
* [834 Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/benefit-enrollment-and-maintenance-x220a1/01GRYB6D6RAWSG8ATBD6GXM13C)
* [835 Health Care Claim Payment/Advice](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-claim-paymentadvice-x221a1/01GRYB6DS30MGXWBPFZCM3695E)
* [837 Health Care Claim](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/transaction-set/837)

When configured, Stedi autogenerates a 997 or 999 acknowledgment for every successful inbound EDI transaction received over a partnership connection, even if the transaction set has not been explicitly configured as an inbound transaction setting. Acknowledgments are generated at the functional group level and contain complete `ISA` and `GS` envelopes, including control numbers.

If a file fails during validation or processing, Stedi does not send an acknowledgment until the file is processed successfully. Per the X12 EDI specification, Stedi doesn't generate acknowledgments in response to
inbound acknowledgments.

<Tip>
  A [`file.failed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-failed) is
  emitted when Stedi fails to process a file. You can use this event to trigger
  a 997 rejection.
</Tip>

### Enable automatic 997s or 999s

Before you begin, you must define at least one [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/index) for this partnership.

To enable automatic 997 or 999 generation:

1. Go to the partnership.
2. Click the pencil next to **Acknowledgments**.
3. Select **997s** or **999s**.
4. Select an existing **Connection** within the partnership. Stedi delivers generated acknowledgments using this connection.
   * (SFTP/FTPS only) Specify an optional **Subdirectory**. Stedi will deliver generated acknowledgments to this subdirectory. We don't recommend specifying a subdirectory unless your trading partner has instructed you to do so.
5. (Optional) Enter a JSONata expression to set a custom filename for generated acknowledgments. Available JSONata expressions are `& (Concatenation)` and `$millis`. If you do not set a filename, Stedi uses the **File Execution ID**.
6. Click **Save**.


# Partnerships
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/profiles-and-partnerships



The first step to add a trading partner is creating a partnership.

## What is a partnership?

Partnerships describe all aspects of the EDI relationship between two profiles in your Stedi account, such as which transaction sets they will exchange and other important information for processing EDI files.

### Types of profiles

Profiles contain the basic information required to construct a valid EDI file. Generally, each profile represents a unique business entity. For example, if you are a brand, you would have a profile for your brand and a profile for each of your retailers.

You can create two types of profiles on Stedi: **Local** profiles for your company (or a company you represent) and **Partner** profiles for the companies you do business with.

Typically, you create a single local profile for your company and a single partner profile for each of your trading partners. If you're using Stedi to represent multiple companies, then you should create multiple local profiles – one for each of the companies you represent. For example, you may have multiple brands that you own, or you may be a SaaS provider using Stedi to power your product's EDI functionality.

In addition to containing important information for processing EDI, profiles also determine the direction of EDI files:

* EDI files are labeled as **inbound** when the **Local** profile is the **receiver**.
* EDI files are labeled as **outbound** when the **Local** profile is the **sender**.

## Create partnerships

To create a partnership manually:

1. Go to the [**Trading partners**](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page.
2. Click **Create partnership**.
3. Enter the information for a [local profile](#create-local-profiles) and a [partner profile](#create-partner-profiles), or select existing profiles from the menus.

### Create local profile

For most use cases, you will only need to set up a single local profile for your company. You can create a new local profile as part of the [create a partnership](#create-partnerships) flow, or from the [Trading partners](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page.

You must enter the following information for each local profile:

* **ID Qualifier** and **Interchange ID**: These values are used to populate the [ISA header](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/ISA) of an EDI file. Your Interchange Qualifier and ID are used by your partner to route EDI files in a similar way to email addresses in an email system. Your trading partner will ask you to provide these values so that they can set you up in their EDI system.

  * In most industries, you can choose these values yourself, since there is no central authority that registers and validates Interchange IDs. A safe choice for the ID Qualifier is `ZZ`, which is a catch-all code that means "Mutually Defined". For the Interchange ID, you can use your company's name (e.g. `STEDI`) or an identifier that you use internally. It's customary for these values to be all uppercase with no spaces or special characters.
  * If you are unsure of what to use, or if your trading partner has specific requirements, [reach out to us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) and we can help you choose the right values.

* **Identifier**: This is never visible to your trading partner and is used for unique identification within your Stedi account only. You can change this value to anything you wish. You cannot edit the name after the profile has been created.

* **Application ID**: This is used to populate the [GS header](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/GS) of an EDI file. Stedi will automatically suggest the same value that you inputted for your Interchange ID, which is the right choice for most use cases. This can be changed at any time, and you can add multiple application IDs if needed, so don't worry about getting it right up front. If the need for multiple application IDs arises in the future, you can add them as-needed. For advanced use cases, you can also override the Application ID on the partnership itself.

### Create partner profile

You need to create a partner profile for each of your trading partners. You can create a new partner profile as part of the [create a partnership](#create-partnerships) flow, or from the [Trading partners](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page.

You must enter the following information for each partner profile:

* **ID Qualifier** and **Interchange ID**: Your partner will provide you with this information as part of the onboarding process. If they haven't already, you should request this from them. If you get stuck or aren't sure what to ask, [reach out to us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) and we can help ensure the profile is set up correctly.
* **Identifier**: This is never visible to your trading partner and is used for unique identification within your Stedi account only. You cannot edit the name after the profile has been created.
* **Application ID**: This value is used to populate the [GS header](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/GS) of an EDI file. Stedi will automatically suggest the same value that you inputted for your partner's Interchange ID, which is the right choice for most use cases. Some trading partners use the GS ID to specify a specific department within their business. If your trading partner has asked you to use a specific GS ID (or multiple IDs), you can add them here. This can be changed at any time.

### Finish partnership

Once you have created the local and partner profiles, finalize the partnership:

1. Review the autogenerated **Partnership identifier**. The Partnership identifier is never visible to your trading partner and is only used for unique identification with your Stedi account. You can change it to any value that is the most helpful to you. You cannot edit the name after the profile has been created.
2. Click **Create Partnership**. You will be brought to the partnership details page where you can define additional settings.

## (Advanced) Auto-configure from sample EDI files

If you have EDI files from your trading partner, you can use the auto-configure option to create profiles and partnerships based on those sample files. This is an advanced option that is best suited for migrations.

Stedi extracts information from the file to generate two profiles - one for you and one for your partner – as well as a new partnership between them.

To automatically generate profiles and partnerships from EDI files:

1. Go to the [**Trading partners**](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page and click **Create partnership**.
2. Click **Advanced** and then the link to **auto-configure partnerships**.
3. Upload an EDI file.
4. Review the profiles to ensure the pre-populated fields are correct. Refer to [create local profiles](#create-local-profiles) and a [create partner profiles](#create-partner-profiles) for field descriptions.
   > **Important:** Set your company as the **Local** profile and your trading partner as a **Partner** profile.
5. By default, a partnership will also be created when you click **Create**. To disable the creation of a partnership, toggle the **Create partnership** option to OFF.
6. Click **Create**. Two profiles and the new partnership are created.

You can view the new profiles and partnership on the [**Trading partners**](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page.

## Next steps

After you create profiles and partnerships, you can configure the details of each partnership to start processing EDI files.

### Configure connections

Within each partnership, you can create one or more SFTP, FTP, FTPS, or AS2 connections in order to exchange files with your trading partner. Visit [connections](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections) for details.

### Configure transaction settings

Within each partnership, you can define the EDI transaction sets you plan to exchange with trading partners. Visit [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) for details.

### Configure acknowledgments

Stedi can automatically generate a 997 Functional Acknowledgement or a 999 Implementation Acknowledgment for each inbound transaction within a partnership. Visit [Functional acknowledgments](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/functional-acknowledgments) for details.


# Transaction settings
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings



Within each [partnership](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/profiles-and-partnerships), you can specify the EDI transaction sets that you plan to exchange with that trading partner.

For example, you may want to receive inbound 850 Purchase Orders from a retailer and send outbound 810 Invoices to them. This would involve creating an inbound transaction setting for 850 Purchase Orders and an outbound transaction setting for 810 Invoices.

## Create transaction settings

To create a transaction setting, navigate to the partnership and click either:

* **Create inbound transaction setting** to configure a transaction set you plan to receive from your trading partners
* **Create outbound transaction setting** to configure a transaction set you plan to send to your trading partner.

### Choose a transaction set

When you configure a transaction setting, you must select a machine-readable EDI specification ([Stedi guide](/edi-platform/guides/index)) for the transaction set.

Guides allow Stedi to validate and parse (inbound) or validate and generate (outbound) EDI data according to your and your trading partner's specific requirements.

* **Import from network (recommended):** Search for your trading partner and click **Select** to import a local copy of the guide into your account.
* **My account:** Select an existing guide from your account.
* **Base guide:** Stedi validates the transaction against the generic X12 specification. This option is useful for testing inbound flows when your partner hasn't yet provided a guide. We do not recommend using it for outbound flows except in rare, advanced use cases.
  * Select the X12 **Release**. The release is present in the `GS` segment of every EDI file, and also should be specified in your partner’s documentation.
  * Select the **Transaction set**. The transaction set is the EDI transaction you are receiving from your partner.

### (Inbound) Configure fragments

If the guide you choose is set up to use [fragments](/edi-platform/fragments), you can enable fragments for the transaction setting. Fragments allow you to split large transactions from Stedi into smaller chunks for downstream ingestion.

### (Outbound) Application IDs

Stedi automatically suggests the default **Application IDs** that were assigned to the local and partner profiles. You can override these values if needed. For example, some trading partners may assign a specific `GS` ID to you during the onboarding process. Since this `GS` ID is used only for this partnership, you would not want to put it in your local profile.

### (Outbound) Connection

Specify the **Connection** to deliver generated EDI files. If no connection is specified, you can't generate outbound EDI files for this transaction.

For **SFTP/FTPS**, You can optionally add a subdirectory that Stedi uses for this transaction set only. For example, your trading partner may require that you place all 810 Invoices in an `/810` subdirectory. We don't recommend specifying a subdirectory unless your trading partner has instructed you to do so.

### (Outbound) Custom filename expression

By default, Stedi autogenerates a unique name for outbound files using a UUID. To set a custom filename, open **Advanced settings** and enter a JSONata expression into the **Filename expression** field.

You can use `& (Concatenation)`, `$random`,  or `$millis` in the expression to generate a unique name based on a random number and/or the processing timestamp. For example, the expression `“EDI850-” & $millis()` results in filenames like `EDI850-5182341242`.

## Control numbers

Control numbers are used in the [`ISA` Interchange Control Header](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/ISA) and [`GS` Functional Group Header](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/GS) of X12 EDI files. You and your trading partners can use them reference EDI files and to detect duplicates and missing data. Control numbers must be unique within a partnership.

Stedi handles control numbers automatically for you. When you create a partnership, Stedi sets the control number counters to `0` for both the Interchange (ISA) and Group (GS) levels. Each time you send an outbound EDI file, Stedi increments the control numbers to ensure uniqueness.

### Reset control numbers

In rare circumstances, you may need to reset the control numbers for a partnership. For example, if you're migrating from another EDI system, you may need to reset the control numbers to match the last control numbers used in your previous system.

To reset control numbers for outbound documents:

1. Go to the partnership where you want to adjust the control numbers.
2. Open the **Advanced settings** menu.
3. Update the **Interchange** or **Group** control numbers as needed.

### Non-numeric control numbers

Stedi can translate EDI files containing non-numeric control numbers, if required for your use case.

Successful processing requires that you set the `ST-02` and `SE-02` control number elements in the associated Stedi guide to type `String`.

## Timezone and time format

Stedi uses the following default values:

* **Timezone:** UTC | Used in the `ISA` and `GS` segments
* **Time format:** `HHMMSS` | The [GS-05](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/GS#GS-05) time element

You can change these values in the partnership's **Advanced settings** menu.

## Next steps

We recommend configuring [Acknowledgments](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/functional-acknowledgments) for inbound transactions within the partnership.

We also recommend configuring one or more [webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index) to automatically send events from Stedi to your internal systems and business applications.


# Configure webhooks
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/configure-webhooks



Configuring a webhook involves:

* Creating a [credential set](#credential-set) for authentication to the endpoint.
* Creating a [webhook](#webhook) that specifies the URL where Stedi should deliver events.
* Adding one or more [event bindings](#event-bindings) that trigger the webhook.

## Credential set

A credential set defines how to authenticate with a specific API. You can use a single credential set across multiple webhooks. Stedi supports the following types of configurations.

| Type       | Description                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Keys   | The API keys as headers in the request. The most common version is ‘bearer tokens’.                                        |
| Basic Auth | [HTTP Basic Auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Authentication), where you provide a username and password. |
| None       | For endpoints that don't require any authentication.                                                                       |

### Unauthenticated endpoints

When using the 'None' credential set type in webhooks, it's functionally the same as using 'API Keys'. However, we set a dummy value for `Header name` and `Value` (`x-stedi-noauth` and `dummy`). Since the receiving API isn't authenticating the call, it will ignore these values and accept the request.

### Create credential set

You can define a credential set as part of configuring a new webhook. You can also create a new credential set independently and then attach it to one or more webhooks.

To create a credential set:

1. Go to the [Webhooks](https://portal.stedi.com/app/webhooks) page.
2. Click **Manage credentials**, and then click **Create credential set**.
3. Enter a name.
4. Choose the appropriate **Authentication type**.
5. Enter the details.
6. Click **Create credential set**.

## Webhook

A webhook defines which URL endpoint Stedi should call when the webhook is invoked, and which HTTP method to use (`POST`, `PUT`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).

You can only attach one credential set to each webhook. However, you might have multiple webhooks for a single system integration, each with a different endpoint.

### Create webhook

To create a new webhook:

1. Go to the [Webhooks](https://portal.stedi.com/app/webhooks) page.
2. Click **Create webhook**.
3. Enter a name.
4. Choose a **Method** and enter an **Endpoint** URL. This is where Stedi delivers the events when the webhook is invoked.
5. Select a **Credential set** to use for authentication or create a new one for this endpoint.
6. (Optional) Set the **Concurrency**. You can set the maximum number of deliveries that Stedi will attempt to deliver to the endpoint at one time. This can help you avoid overloading the target service.

## Event bindings

Event bindings allow you to specify which events trigger the webhook. You can create multiple event bindings for a single webhook. For example, you may want to create an event binding for each type of transaction you want to send to your API.

### Create event binding

To create a new event binding:

1. Go to the [Webhooks](https://portal.stedi.com/app/webhooks) page.
2. Click the webhook.
3. Click the **Event bindings** tab.
4. Click **New event binding**.
5. Choose an **Event type** and complete the remaining fields. To listen for processed transactions, select **Transaction processed** or **Fragment processed**. Visit [Event types](/edi-platform/operate/event-types) for details about each event.
6. Click **Create binding**.

### Ingest processed transactions

You can use the provided download URLs in the following events to retrieve the processed transaction data from Stedi.

* [Transaction processed events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#transaction-processed): An EDI file can contain multiple transactions, so a single EDI file can produce multiple events that each invoke the configured webhook.
* [Fragment processed events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#fragment-processed): When [Fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) are enabled, Stedi emits one fragment processed event for each fragment within the processed transaction.

You may want to configure the following settings for transaction processed or fragment processed events:

1. **Transaction set ID:** This is useful if you want to send events for different transaction sets to different endpoints. For example, you could send events for 850 Purchase Orders to one endpoint and events for 860 Purchase Order Change Requests to another.
2. **Partnership ID:** This is useful if you want to send events from different partners to different endpoints. For example, you could send events from processed Walmart transactions to one endpoint and events from processed Target transactions to another. This is less common.
3. **Guide:** This is useful if you want to send events from transactions parsed using different guides to different endpoints. For example, you may receive `005010` 850 Purchase Orders from two different retailers, and those retailers have different guides. Since the transaction payloads will differ, you may want to send them to different API endpoints within your system.
4. (Optional) You can configure the following **Advanced** settings:
   * **Connection:** This is useful when you are using multiple connections for a single partnership. For example, you may have set up one connection type for test data and a separate connection for production data.
   * **Mode:** Specify the type of data Stedi is processing. You can choose from **Test** or **Production**.


# Webhooks error handling and limitations
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/error-handling-webhooks



[Webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/configure-webhooks) have certain limitations. If your system's API has different requirements, you can set the target to be:

* A function, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions, which can then call the third-party API
* An iPaaS platform, such as Zapier or Workato, which can then call the third-party API.

## HTTP response codes

Stedi considers a 2xx response a success, and marks any other response as a failure.

Stedi retries events associated with status codes other than `2xx` for up to 4 times with a 90 second wait period inbetween retries.

If the maximum number of retries has been exhausted, Stedi adds the event to the [error queue](#error-queue) for the webhook.

You can set the **Concurrency** when configuring the webhook to prevent throttling. This setting determines the maximum number of deliveries that Stedi will attempt to deliver to the endpoint at one time.

## Response time

The target endpoint must respond within 5 seconds, or the event will be counted as a failed delivery.

## Retries

When a delivery fails, Stedi will retry up to 4 times every 90 seconds. After the fifth retry, Stedi moves the event to the error queue.

### Duplicate deliveries

If your webook doesn't respond within 5 seconds, Stedi marks that as a failure and then automatically retries. This can result in duplicate deliveries, so we **strongly recommend** implementing ways to manage duplicates delivered through webhooks.

## Error queue

Each webhook includes an error queue. Each item in the queue consists of the original event that was attempted to be delivered. This ensures if the target service has some downtime, or anything else goes wrong, the missed events can be retried later. The error queue retains items for 14 days.

The order of the error queue is not guaranteed. The downstream service must be designed to be idempotent to handle at-least-once delivery of events, and must accept events out of order.

## Logs

To view logs, click the webhook to go to its detail page, and then navigate to the **Logs** tab.

## Deauthorized connections

If a webhook sends a message to an endpoint that returns a 401 (Unauthorized) response, the destination will be 'deauthorized'. In this state, the webhook won't be able to deliver messages.

If there is an issue with your authentication information (such as the password, API key, or OAuth settings), edit the webhook to fix it.

If the authentication information is correct, and there was a different reason for the endpoint returning a 401, you can try again by adding a temporary header. For example, `x-stedi-reauthorize` with today's date as a value. When you save, the webhook will attempt to deliver again. This header can be removed later. Editing the value of a header will also restart deliveries.

You will likely have a queue of messages to deliver, so Stedi will automatically start retrying them after you make this change. If the endpoint is still returning an invalid response, the webhook will return to `Deauthorized`.


# Webhooks overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index



Each time you receive an EDI file from a trading partner, you will want to ingest the transactions into your downstream system for processing. You can do this by configuring a webhook. Webhooks allow you to send events from Stedi to third-party services without writing any custom code.

Stedi can send webhooks to:

* Custom applications using Basic or API Key authorization
* Cloud functions, including AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions
* iPaaS platforms, such as Zapier, Workato, or Tray.io
* ERPs like NetSuite, SAP, or Oracle.

The most common use case is ingesting processed transaction data into your internal systems and business applications. You can configure a webhook to send `transaction.processed.v2` events to your system and then programatically retrieve the processed transaction data from Stedi using the provided download URL.

You can also configure webhooks for other [Stedi events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types), like when a processing error occurs. This can be used to trigger alerts in systems like Slack, PagerDuty, or Zendesk for further review.

## Composite element

A single [element](#element) that contains multiple values of different types, similar to a struct or record. The [specification](#specification) will specify which fields make up a composite element. The values in a composite element are kept apart by a [delimiter](#delimiter). The delimiter to use is specified in the [interchange](#interchange) header. In the following example, values are delimited using a `:`.

```
PRV*LA***ORT:HS:Y~
```

## Delimiter

A delimiter is used in the [X12 EDI Format](#x12-edi-format) to mark the end of a [segment](#segment) or [element](#element). The end of a [segment](#segment) is [delimited](#delimiter) by a `~` and the end of an [element](#element) by a `*`. Here's an example of two segments, both with three elements.

```edi
SE*2*0000~
GE*1*987654321~
```

There are also delimiters for [repeated elements](#repeated-element) and [composite elements](#composite-element), but these aren't standardized. Instead, these delimiters are specified in the [interchange](#interchange).

## Element

An element is a data field within a [segment](#segment). In the [X12 EDI Format](#x12-edi-format), elements in a [segment](#segment) are delimited by a `*`. For example, here's a [segment](#segment) with several elements.

```edi
GS*SO*00*00*20210902*1200*987654321*X*008010~
```

The values an element may contain, are described in a [specification](#specification).

## EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)

EDI – Electronic Data Interchange – is an umbrella term for many different “standardized” frameworks for exchanging business-to-business transactions like invoices, insurance applications, train sheets, credit reports. It is often used synonymously with two of the most popular standards – [X12](#x12-edi-format), used primarily in North America, and [EDIFACT](#edifact-format), which is prevalent throughout Europe. Read more: [What makes EDI so hard?](https://www.stedi.com/blog/what-makes-edi-so-hard)

## EDIFACT format

A file format for encoding [EDI](#edi) data, standardized by United Nations/Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (UN/EDIFACT).

## Functional group

Within an [EDI](#edi) file, a functional group is a set of [transaction sets](#transaction-set). Typically, all the [transaction sets](#transaction-set) within a functional group are intended for the same department within an organization.

The beginning of a functional group is marked by the [GS](https://edi.stedi.com/x12-008010/segment/GS) [segment](#segment) and the end is marked by the [GE](https://edi.stedi.com/x12-008010/segment/GE) [segment](#segment). A functional group must be part of an [interchange](#interchange).

## Interchange

Within an [EDI](#edi) file, an interchange is a set of [functional groups](#functional-group) which in turn contain [transaction sets](#transaction-set). Typically, the contents of an interchange is intended for a specific organization and the contents of a [functional group](#functional-group) is intended for a specific department within that organization.

The beginning of an interchange is marked by the [ISA](https://edi.stedi.com/x12-008010/segment/ISA) [segment](#segment) and the end is marked by the [IEA](https://edi.stedi.com/x12-008010/segment/IEA) [segment](#segment). Every EDI file must have at least one interchange and consequently, every EDI file starts with an [ISA](https://edi.stedi.com/x12-008010/segment/ISA) [segment](#segment) and ends with an [IEA](https://edi.stedi.com/x12-008010/segment/IEA) [segment](#segment). Read more: [Control numbers in X12 EDI](https://www.stedi.com/blog/control-numbers-in-x12-edi).

## Loop

A loop is a collection of [segments](#segment) that can appear multiple times in a [transaction set](#transaction-set). The [segments](#segment) in a loop typically have a semantic relationalship, for example, the segments [Party Identification](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/N1), [Geographic Location](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/N4), and [Communication Contact Information](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/COM) together can tell you about a single [trading partner](#trading-partner) and a loop of those segments allows you to refer to multiple [trading partners](#trading-partner) in a [transaction set](#transaction-set).

In [X12 EDI Format](#x12-edi-format), there's no special [delimiter](#delimiter) for loops, nor is there a set of [segments](#segment) that mark the begin and end of the loop, like there is for [interchanges](#interchange), [functional groups](#functional-group), and [transaction sets](#transaction-set). Instead, the segments in the loop are just repeated.

```edi
N1*21*Stedi*ZZ*ID001~
N4*New York**US~
COM*16*stedi.com~
N1*21*Acme*ZZ*ID002~
N4*Miami**US~
COM*16*acmebread.co~
```

## Repeated element

A single [element](#element) that contains multiple values of the same type, similar to a homogeneous array. Not every [element](#element) can be repeated; the [specification](#specification) must indicate that it's okay to do so.

In [X12 EDI Format](#x12-edi-format), the values in a repeated element are kept apart by a [delimiter](#delimiter). The delimiter to use is specified in the [interchange](#interchange) header. In the following example, values are delimited using a `/`.

```edi
AAA*Y***NF/NR/TO~
```

## Repeated segment

Within an [EDI](#edi) file, some segments can occur multiple times in a row. The [specification](#specification) will tell when a segment can be repeated.

In [X12 EDI Format](#x12-edi-format), a repeated segment appears as, well, a segment that's repeated.

```edi
NTE**When a segment has need to repeat,~
NTE**How does one accomplish that feat?~
NTE**It's really no bother.~
NTE**One after the other.~
NTE**A solution that's simple and neat.~
```

## Segment

Within an [EDI](#edi) file, a segment is a set of [elements](#element), where the segment is like a record and the [elements](#element) are its fields. Each segment starts with a segment identifier that tells you which [elements](#element) will follow. The different types of segments and their elements are listed in the [specification](#specification).

In the [X12 EDI Format](#x12-edi-format), segments are [delimited](#delimiter) by a `~`. It's also common to add a new line character after the [delimiter](#delimiter), but that's for human readability only and has no semantic value.

## Specification

A specification describes the data schema of a [transaction set](#transaction-set). It lists the [loops](#loop) and [segments](#segment), the order in which they appear, and the [elements](#element) within the [segments](#segment). The specification gives you all the information you need to write or interpret an [EDI](#edi) document that conforms to that specification.

[X12](#x12) has published [many specifications](https://edi.stedi.com/). A [trading partner](#trading-partner) can use these specifications directly, or they can base their own specification on one of them. Find popular EDI specifications in [the Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network).

## Trading partner

Any business that sends or receives business transactions.

## Transaction set

A transaction set is a type of business document, for example a purchase order, or a booking cancellation. Each transaction set is based on a [specification](#specification) that describes what data the transaction set can and must contain. There is a [list of standardized transaction sets](https://edi.stedi.com/).

The standard transaction sets are designed to be widely applicable. A [trading partner](#trading-partner) can take a transaction set, base its own [specification](#specification) on it, and only accept the data it knows how to handle. Many of these [business-specific transaction sets are available on Stedi](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network).

## X12

An organization that develops and maintains the [X12 EDI](#x12-edi-format) standards.

## X12 EDI Format

A file format for encoding [EDI](#edi) data, standardized by [X12](#x12). It's text-based and makes use of [delimiters](#delimiter) to mark the [segments](#segment) and [elements](#element).


# What is EDI?
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/what-is-edi



Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a structured way for businesses to send and receive documents electronically. It was created in the 70's as a replacement for paper documents. EDI is like a schema to cover all possible business transactions across most industries, but it existed before the Internet was invented. Today, most every large company uses it including Amazon, Walmart, and FedEx.

Prior to EDI, businesses used to exchange paper transactions and record those transactions into a hand-written book called a ledger, but modern businesses use one or many software applications, called business systems, to facilitate operations. There are many types of business systems, ranging from generic software suites like Oracle, SAP, and NetSuite to vertical-specific products that serve some particular industry, like purpose-built systems for healthcare, agriculture, or education.

When broken down to its simplest definition, EDI can be thought of as "getting data from one business system into another".

## Common Uses of EDI

There are more than 300 different EDI transaction types. The following table contains examples of common EDI transactions.

|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## EDI Standards

A few technical standards have been created since the introduction of EDI including X12 in North America and EDIFACT which is prevalent throughout Europe. Standards bodies make changes over time and version releases with names like “Release 004010”. These standards do not exist to solve all of the problems of B2B transactions. Instead they exist to allow a trading partner to understand each of its trading partner's internal syntax and vocabulary.

Standards such as X12 and EDIFACT provide highly structured, opinionated alternatives intended to reduce the surface area of knowledge required to successfully integrate with trading partners. All documents conforming to a given standard follow that standard’s syntax, allowing an adoptee of the standard to work with just one syntax for all trading partners who have also adopted that syntax.

## How is EDI transmitted?

EDI can be transmitted using various protocols, but these are the most common ways to exchange files with your trading partners.

### SFTP/FTPS

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure) are both secure file transfer protocols used to transmit files between computers over a network.

* SFTP is a secure version of the FTP protocol, providing encryption and authentication using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It encrypts both the data being transmitted and the commands used to perform file operations.
* FTPS is an extension of the FTP protocol that adds support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. It can use either implicit SSL, where the entire session is encrypted from the start, or explicit SSL, where the client requests a secure connection after connecting to the server.

You can set up your own SFTP/FTPS server for your trading partner to connect to, or (common with large trading partners) you will need to connect to your trading partner's remote SFTP/FTPS server to exchange files.

### AS2

AS2, or Applicability Statement 2, supports encryption of the data being exchanged and uses digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data. AS2 also supports MDN (message disposition notification), a way for your partner to acknowledge that they have received your message. Some partners may require that you request and accept an MDN response, send MDN responses, or both.

### Value Added Network (VAN)

A VAN acts as an intermediary between trading partners. Instead of establishing a direct connection with your trading partners, you and your partners would connect to a VAN, and the VAN would broker the connection for you. It is not a requirement for you and your partners to use the same VAN — this is called a "VAN to VAN interconnect."

VANs often provide additional services on top of basic message routing. These may include data translation between different EDI standards, data encryption for security, data archiving, auditing, and tracking of transactions.


# Element data types in X12 EDI
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/elements/element-data-types-in-x12-edi



All [elements in X12](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element) have a specific data type: elements can be a string (i.e., alphanumeric), number, decimal, date, time, code, or binary. These data types dictate the kind of data that can be sent in a specific element and how it should be treated by external systems ingesting the EDI.

## String/Alphanumeric (AN)

Elements with the `string` data type are symbolized by the code `AN`. Strings may contain any sequence of characters, including letters, digits, spaces, punctuation marks, spaces, tabs, and/or special characters.

Typically, elements with the string data type are used in free-form fields, where the element name or description explains what information should be contained in the element, and how to interpret it.

While elements with a string data type can support any character, they must not contain the element separator (often `*`), sub-element separator (often `^` or `:`), or segment terminator (often `~`) specified in the envelope; those are reserved solely for those functions. Furthermore, for any EDI transaction that specifies a release character in the `ISX` segment (v7040 or later), you cannot use that release character in any element.

**Examples of `string` elements include:**

* Red
* Working hours: from 9AM to 5PM
* New York
* X253N0123

## Numeric (N0, N2, N4, N6)

Elements with the `numeric` data type are symbolized by `N`. All elements with a numeric data type must contain only digits and an optional minus (-) sign to indicate a negative value.

The `N` indicates that the data type is numeric, and the `0`, `2`, `4`, or `6` indicate the number of implied decimal positions. `N0` implies the number is an integer (i.e., whole numbers), `N2` implies the number contains two decimal positions, `N4` implies the number contains four decimal positions, and `N6` implies the number contains six decimal positions,

For example, if a number is sent in an element with the data type `N0`, it should be interpreted as a whole number, exactly as it is shown.

**Examples of `N0` elements include:**

* 1
* 100
* -645
* 812

If a number is sent in an element with the data type `N2`, it should be interpreted as if it has two decimal places.

**Examples of `N2` elements include:**

* 123.45 would be sent as 12345
* -5 would be sent as -500
* 100 would be sent as 10000

In practice, the `N2` data type is often used in elements that describe a monetary amount. For example, the [610 (Amount)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element/610) element is used in the [TDS01](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/TDS) to represent the invoice total amount, and has a data type of `N2`. This implies the value of `TDS01` has two decimals. For example: `TDS*1000` implies a dollar value of `$10`, not `$1000`.

## Decimal number (R)

Elements with the `decimal number` data type are symbolized by the code `R`. In an element with a decimal data type, decimals are optional for all integers, but are required for all fractional values. Decimal numbers also support a leading minus (-) sign, if needed, whereas the absence of a minus sign implies a positive value. Therefore, the plus sign (+) should not be transmitted.

The minus sign and the decimal point are not counted when determining the length of the data element. Additionally, all leading zeros in an element with a decimal number type should be suppressed, unless needed to satisfy minimum length requirements.

**Examples of `decimal` elements include:**

* 12.345
* 2000
* 765.000
* -95

## Dates (DT)

Elements with the `date` data type are symbolized by the code `DT`. Based on the X12 version, data formats are treated differently.

Before v4010, all dates were in the `YYMMDD` format, where `YY` represents the last two digits of the calendar year, `MM` represents the month (01 to 12), and `DD` represents the day of the month (01 to 31).

**Examples of dates in `YYMMDD` format include:**

* `980127`, which indicates `January 27th, 1998`
* `220815`, which indicates `August 15th, 2022`

Starting from v4010, all dates are represented in the `CCYYMMDD` format, where `CC` represents the first two digits of the calendar year, `YY` represents the last two digits of the calendar year, `MM` represents the month (01 to 12), and `DD` represents the day of the month (01 to 31).

**Examples of dates in `CCYYMMDD` format include:**

* `20230202`, which indicates `February 2nd, 2023`
* `20220120`, which indicates `January 20th, 2022`

**Note:** The [ISA09 (interchange date)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/ISA) only supports the `YYMMDD` date format, regardless of which X12 version is used.

## Time (TM)

Elements with the `time` data type are symbolized by the code `TM`. Time in the X12 standard is expressed in a 24-hour clock format (e.g.,`HHMM`, `HHMMSS`, `HHMMSSD`, or `HHMMSSDD`). `HH` is the numeric expression of the hour (00 to 23), `MM` is the numeric expression of the minute (00 to 59), `SS` is the numeric expression of the second (00 to 59), and `DD` is the numeric expression of the decimal seconds. Decimal seconds are expressed as follows: `D` = tenths (0 to 9) and `DD` = hundredths (00 to 99).

**Examples of `time` elements include:**

* `1845`, which represents `18:15` in `HHMM` format
* `091530`, which represents `09:15:30` in `HHMMSS` format
* `10220302`, which represents `10:22:03:02` in `HHMMSSDD` format

**Note:** Time elements are often accompanied by another element in the same segment, indicating which timezone the time is in.

## Identifier (ID)

Elements with the `identifier` data type, sometimes referred to as a `code`, are symbolized by the code `ID`. An element with an `ID` data type must always contain a value from a predefined list of values that is maintained by X12, other bodies that are recognized by X12, or are universally known (e.g., Standard Carrier Alpha Codes (SCACs), or state/province codes). The intent of the identifier data type is to allow computers to validate data elements based on a standard list of codes, without having to agree upon the meaning of each code.

For the elements that contain a predefined list of X12 identifiers, each one has a code and a description (e.g., `ST` and `Ship To`). An *extended code definition*, which provides additional information to help explain the meaning of the code, may also be supplied in addition to the identifier description.

**Examples of pre-defined X12 `identifier` codes include:**

* `ST` - ship to
* `Z7` - mark for party
* `YC` - bail payor

In addition to elements with a predefined list of X12 identifier codes, there are several elements that have the `ID` data type without a predefined list. Here are some examples:

* Element [156 (State or province code)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element/156) should contain the two-digit code of a US state (e.g., `CA` for California), Canadian provinces (e.g.,`ON` for Ontario), or any other state/province/region code specific for a given country (must be exactly two characters).
* Element [26 (Country Code)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element/26) should contain a two-letter country code defined by ISO 3166 (e.g., `US` for the United States of America, `IN` for India).
* Element [140 (SCAC)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element/140) should contain a two- to four-character code that represents a carrier, as defined by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA). However, in practice, SCACs are often sent as mutually agreed upon values.

While X12 is standardized, in practice, many trading partners will deviate from these predefined lists. X12 provides a mechanism for doing this, by supporting “mutually-defined” codes, signified by the codes `Z`, `ZZ`, or `ZZZ`. While mutually-defined codes are available, some trading partners might choose to “break” the X12 standard by utilizing their own custom codes and descriptions in their implementation guides. Lastly, some trading partners will interpret the predefined codes differently (e.g., they will use the `WH` (warehouse) qualifier code, as opposed to the `SF` (ship from) code).

## Binary (B)

Elements with the `binary` data type are symbolized by the code `B`. A binary data element contains a sequence of bytes. Those bytes may include characters that normally have special meaning, like the segment separator, or the element separator. For that reason, binary data isn’t parsed like the rest of the X12 document. Instead, binary data always comes with a length, so that it’s clear where the binary data ends.

There are only a few segments with a binary data element.

* [BIN](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/BIN) is used to transfer files. It always comes as part of a loop that also include the [EFI](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/EFI) segment. `EFI` contains the metadata of the file, `BIN` contains the contents.
* [BDS](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/BDS) (v4020 and up) is also used to transfer files, but it’s paired with [OOI](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/OOI) instead of `EFI`. `OOI` is a more flexible way to encode a file’s metadata. Unlike `BIN`, `BDS` includes an element that tells you how the binary data is encoded, for example base64, uuencoding, no encoding, etc.
* [S3S](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/S3S) and [S4S](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/S4S) are used for sending data securely. They both use binary (v4020 and up) to send encrypted and/or compressed data.

Stedi supports reading and writing binary encodings that are valid UTF-8 strings such as ASCII and Base64. It does not support unfiltered binary data.


# Element Requirements in X12 EDI
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/elements/element-requirements-in-x12-edi



When an [element](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element) is in the context of a [segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment), the X12 standard specifies three types of element requirements: mandatory, optional, or conditional. In addition to the requirements given by X12, trading partners will often deviate slightly from the standard to suit their business needs. This is both expected and valid.

Trading partners share these requirements as *implementation guides*, usually via PDF. Most X12 implementation guides used in the industry were built using a tool called SpecBuilder, which creates a standard PDF format. We will use SpecBuilder PDFs and their terminology to explain element requirements below, but your trading partner might send these requirements in different format (e.g., CSV, Word, custom PDF).

In these implementation guides, the element requirements given by X12 are found in a column called *Requirement* (or *Req* for short). The *Req* column displays these requirements as `M` for mandatory, `O` for optional, and `C` or `X` for conditional. If a trading partner deviates from the specifications given by X12, those deviations are usually found in a column called *Usage* or *Attributes*, and they use a different syntax, like `Must use`, `Used`, and `Dependent`.

## X12 types

### Mandatory

Mandatory elements are marked with an `M` in most implementation guides, but `R` (required) is used as well. If an element is defined as mandatory in a segment, then you cannot send X12 data without it. In most cases, transactions that are missing mandatory elements will either be stopped by the sender or rejected by the recipient.

For example, the `BIG01` (Invoice Date) and the `BIG02` (Invoice Number) in the [BIG segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/BIG) used in all [X12 810 Invoices](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/transaction-set/810) are mandatory elements. You cannot send an invoice without the invoice number and date.

<Image alt="Image of Mandatory usage in the BIG Segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/element-requirements/image1.jpg" width="1238px" height="535px" caption="" />

### Optional

Optional elements are marked with an `O` in most implementation guides.

These elements sometimes carry additional information in the notes section of the PDF, such as when the element should be used. If an element is marked as optional, it can be omitted in the data and the transaction would still be valid.

For example, the `BIG03` (Purchase Order Date) and `BIG04` (Purchase Order Number) in [X12 810 Invoices](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/810) are optional elements. According to X12, you can send an invoice without the corresponding purchase order number and date, and it would still be a valid transaction.

<Image alt="Image of Optional usage in the BIG Segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/element-requirements/image2.jpg" width="1238px" height="535px" caption="" />

### Conditional

Conditional elements, marked with either a `C` or an `X`, are a special case. Their usage depends on the other elements within the same segment. In some situations these elements might be mandatory, and in others – optional.

Whenever there is an element marked with a `C` or an `X`, there will be a corresponding *Syntax Rules* block on the same page. For example, on the `DTM` segment page below, the syntax rules appear below the last element definition.

<Image alt="Image of Conditional usage in the DTM segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/element-requirements/image3.jpg" width="1239px" height="612px" caption="" />

In order to understand how and when to use an element that is marked as conditional, you first need to understand the X12 syntax rule used. Every syntax rule begins with an identifier: `P`, `R`, `E`, `C`, or `L`. The identifier is followed by two or more elements involved in the condition, where each element occupies two digits (e.g., `01`, `05`, `11`).

**Conditional rule definitions:**

| Letter | Name             | Condition                                                                                 | Example |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| P      | Paired           | If the first element is present, then all the other elements must be present.             | P0102   |
| R      | Required         | At least one of the elements must be present.                                             | R020304 |
| E      | Exclusive        | Only one of the elements may be present.                                                  | E0305   |
| C      | Conditional      | If the first element is present, then all the other elements must be present.             | C0102   |
| L      | List conditional | If the first element is present, then at least one of the other elements must be present. | L010308 |

## Trading partner specific element requirements

The element requirements defined by the X12 standard dictate which elements are optional, mandatory, or conditional when used in a segment. However, most businesses do not use all the elements in the standard - and for those that they use, they often need to change their requirements. As such, they use the elements, and change their requirements, to best serve their business requirements.

For example, your trading partners may decide that some elements—whether optional or conditional as per the standard—must be present in the data (e.g., are mandatory). On the other hand, this does not work in reverse; according to the X12 standard, you cannot mark elements that are mandatory as optional or conditional in your guide. In practice, some businesses break the X12 standard and ask trading partner's to conform to their specification nonetheless.

When a trading partner deviates from the base X12 specification, their implementation guide will usually contain a column titled *Usage* or *Trading Partner Name Requirements*. Instead of using the typical `M`, `O`, `C`, and `X` syntax, they will use other terms like `Must Use`, `Used`, or `Dependent`.

Below is an example of an [MEA (Measurement) segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/MEA) with multiple elements and composite elements which are considered optional or conditional by the X12 v4010 standard, but all marked as `Must use`:

<Image alt="Image of Trade Partner Deviating from the spec for MEA Segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/element-requirements/image4.jpg" caption="" width="1235px" height="903px" />

Below is a table which explains the relationship between the customer defined usage and standard X12 codes:

| Customer Defined Usage | Equivalent X12 type | Definition                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Must Use               | M                   | May be sent on the EDI transaction                                      |

# Relational conditions in X12 EDI
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/elements/relational-conditions-in-x12-edi



All [elements](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element) in the X12 standard can be marked as mandatory (`M`), optional (`O`), or Conditional (`C` or `X`). If an element is marked as conditional, its usage depends on the presence (or absence) of other elements in the same segment. These relational conditions are described using a specific X12 syntax and are usually found in the implementation guide shared between trading partners. While relational conditions were touched on briefly in [Element Requirements in X12 EDI](https://www.stedi.com/edi/essentials/x12/elements/element-requirements), this article provides a more in-depth analysis of the subject.

## Overview

If an element is marked as conditional, that condition is governed by the associated syntax rule. Every syntax rule begins with an identifier: `P`, `R`, `E`, `C`, or `L`. Each identifier is then followed by two or more elements involved in the condition, where each element is referred to by its position in the segment (e.g., `01`, `05`, `11`), and each element position occupies two digits. For a given segment, there can be one or more syntax rules, and a single element can be associated with one or more syntax rules inside a single segment.

The table below describes the meaning of each rule:

| Letter | Name             | Condition                                                                                 | Example |
| :----- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| P      | Paired           | If the first element is present, then all the other elements must be present.             | P0102   |
| R      | Required         | At least one of the elements must be present.                                             | R020304 |
| E      | Exclusive        | Only one of the elements may be present.                                                  | E0305   |
| C      | Conditional      | If the first element is present, then all the other elements must be present.             | C0102   |
| L      | List conditional | If the first element is present, then at least one of the other elements must be present. | L010308 |

## Paired (P)

If a syntax rule starts with `P`, it is a *paired condition*. This condition means that if any element in the rule is present in the segment, then all the other element(s) in the rule must be present as well.

A typical example of when a paired syntax rule is used is when one element describes the meaning of another. For example, elements [N103 (Identification Code Qualifier)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element/66) and [N104 (Identification Code)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element/67) are always paired, which is indicated by the syntax rule `P0304`. This means that if one of them is present, then the other must be present as well.

These two elements are paired because only sending one element would not make sense without the other. In this example, the `N103` “qualifies” the `N104` – it explains who or what entity assigned the identification code. Providing just the qualifier or just the identification code does not provide a trading partner with enough information, so they must be sent together.

**The description of the paired syntax rule always follows this format:**

* If either \{XX}, \{YY},..., or \{ZZ} is present, then the other is required.

<Image alt="Image of Paired syntax rule in the N1 Segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/relational-conditions/1.jpg" width="1238px" height="924px" caption="" />

## Required (R)

If a syntax rule starts with `R`, it is a *required condition*. This condition means that at least one of the elements listed in the rule must be present in the segment. Typically, a required syntax rule is used when there are multiple positions within a segment to provide the necessary information, but not all elements are needed to communicate that information.

A good example of a required syntax rule is in the [TXI (Tax Information) segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/TXI). This segment contains the R020306 syntax rule, which indicates that at least one of `TXI02` (Monetary Amount), `TXI03` (Percent), or `TXI06` (Tax Exempt Code) is required. This means that you can provide the tax amount (e.g., \$18.65), the tax percent (e.g., 12%), the code that explains tax exemption (e.g., `F`, Exempt from Goods and Services Tax), or all three - but you have to supply at least one, otherwise it will not convey enough information.

**The description of the required syntax rule always follows this format:**

* At least one of \{XX}, \{YY},..., or \{ZZ} is required.

<Image alt="Image of Required syntax rule in the TXI Segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/relational-conditions/2.jpg" width="1238px" height="1080px" caption="" />

## Exclusive (E)

If a syntax rule starts with `E`, it is an *exclusive condition*. Only one of the elements in the syntax rule may be present, but no others.

Typically, an exclusive syntax rule is used when there are multiple elements in a segment that, if sent together, would cause a conflict in interpretation. A good example of an exclusive syntax rule is in the [G72 (Allowance or Charge) segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/G72). This segment contains a `G7205` (Allowance or Charge Rate), a `G7208` (Allowance or Charge Total Amount), and a `G7209` (Allowance or Charge Percent). Because an allowance or charge can only be indicated as a unit rate, a total amount, or a percent (but not as more than one), these elements cannot be sent together.

**The description of the exclusive syntax rule always follows this format:**

* Only one of \{X}, \{Y},..., or \{Z} may be present.

<Image alt="Image of Exclusive syntax rule in the G72 Segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/relational-conditions/3.jpg" width="1238px" height="628px" caption="" />

## Conditional (C)

If a syntax rule starts with `C`, it is a *conditional rule*. If the first element listed in the rule is present, then the subsequent elements must be present as well.

Typically, conditional rules are used because the first element listed in the rule cannot stand on its own; It is only useful when the subsequent elements are present. An example of a conditional rule is when there are two elements in the rule, and the first element listed provides added context to the second element. This is different from a paired syntax rule because the second element listed could stand on its own without the first element, whereas the first cannot.

For example, the [DTM (Date/Time Reference) segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/DTM) has a `C0403` syntax rule. This rule states that if the `DTM04` (Time Code) is present then the `DTM03` (Time) is required. A time code in this case is synonymous with “time zone” (e.g., PT, ET, IST, etc.). As such, if the time code is present, but no time is present, then the time code is useless. However, if the `DTM03` (Time) is present, then the time code is not necessarily required (but in this case, could be ambiguous).

**The description of the conditional syntax rule always follows this format:**

* If \{X} is present, then \{Y} is required.

<Image alt="Image of Conditional syntax rule in the DTM Segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/relational-conditions/4.jpg" width="1237px" height="1018px" caption="" />

## List conditional (L)

If a syntax rule starts with `L`, it is a *list conditional rule*. If the first element in the rule is present, then at least one of the other elements listed in the rule is required. There must always be three or more elements in a list conditional rule, otherwise, a conditional syntax rule should be used.

Typically, list conditional rules are used because the first element cannot stand on its own, and there are multiple other elements in the segment that can be used to provide the necessary information. For example, the [ITD (Terms of Sale/Deferred Terms of Sale) segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/ITD) contains the `L03040513` rule. This means that if the `ITD03` (Terms Discount Percent) is present, then at least one of `ITD04` (Terms Discount Due Date), `ITD05` (Terms Discount Days Due), or `ITD13` (Day of Month) is required.

Because the terms discount percent given in the `ITD03` needs an associated date, then one of the terms (i.e., discount due date, the terms discount days due, or the day of the month) is required in order to convey the information necessary to the recipient. As with conditional rules, the presence of `ITD04`, `ITD05`, or `ITD13` does not make `ITD03` required.

**The description of the conditional syntax rule always follows this format:**

* If \{X} is present, then at least one of \{Y},..., or \{Z} is required.

# What is an element in X12 EDI?
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/elements/what-is-an-element



[Elements](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element) in X12 EDI are the primary source of information exchanged in an EDI transaction. [Segments](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment) logically group elements together in order to convey specific information. You will always see elements inside of a segment, and elements are separated from the segment and other elements by delimiters (e.g., `*`, `|`, etc.).

Outside the context of a segment, the X12 standard defines an ID, a name, description, data type, and min and max length for every element. These element attributes are fixed; they do not change, regardless of what segment the element is found in.

When an element is in the context of a segment, the X12 standard provides additional attributes, such as the element’s position and its requirement. These attributes are variable; they change based on which segment the element is contained in.

For example, each element in the [BEG segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/BEG) below has its own fixed attributes, and then additional attributes based on the fact they are used in the `BEG` segment. For example, the [373 Date element](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/element/373) always has the `date` data type and a min and max length of eight characters; but when it is used in the fifth element of the `BEG` segment (e.g., the `20220610` below), it is always mandatory.

`BEG*00*NE*080032**20220610~`

<Image alt="Image of BEG segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/1.png" width="1238px" height="1190px" caption="" />

## Element attributes

### IDs

Each element is given a unique ID that can be one to four characters in length. There are more than 2,000 unique elements in the X12 EDI standard. For example, the `Purchase Order Type Code` element has the ID `92`, whereas the Date element has the ID `373`. The IDs of *simple* *elements* are numeric, but *composite data elements* are prefixed with a `C`, and elements found in interchange segments are prefixed with `I`.

You can see the full list of elements and their IDs [here](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/element).

<Image alt="Image of 373 Date element" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/2.png" width="1176px" height="428px" caption="" />

### Names

Each element is given a name, which is a short, generic description of what data the element represents. For example, the name of the `324` element is `Purchase Order Number` and the name of the `100` element is `Currency Code`. While the element is given a unique element ID, in practice, the element name is used for identifying the element, not the ID.

You can see the full list of elements and their names [here](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/element).

<Image alt="Image of 324 Purchase Order Number element" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/3.png" width="940px" height="424px" caption="" />

### Descriptions and semantic notes

In addition to the element name, X12 provides a longer description to explain what the element represents and how it is used. For example, the `373` Date element has the following description: date expressed as `CCYYMMDD` where `CC` represents the first two digits of the calendar year.

When an element is in the context of a segment, X12 will occasionally provide semantic notes, which explain how that element is used specifically inside of the segment. For example, the `373` Date element has an extra note when it is in the `BEG` segment: in the `BEG`, the Date element (`BEG05`) is the date assigned by the purchaser to purchase order.

<Image alt="Image of 373 Date element and semantic notes" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/4.png" width="1238px" height="169px" caption="" />

### Data types

All elements in X12 have a specific data type: elements can be a string (i..e., alphanumeric), number, decimal, date, time, code, or binary. These data types dictate the kind of data that can be sent in a specific element and how it should be treated by external systems ingesting the EDI.

**Note:** Element separators (often `*`), sub-element separators (often `^` or `:`), and segment terminators (often `~` or `\n`) cannot be used in any elements, regardless of data types.

| **Data type**         | **Acronym** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Decimals              | R           | May contain numbers with decimal points (if needed) and a minus sign for negative values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <ul><li>12.345</li> <li>-95</li> <li>765.00</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                |
| Dates                 | DT          | Date formats in X12 depend on trading partner specs and the version used. X12 versions before v4010 used YYMMDD format. After v4010, CCYYMMDD format is preferred, where CC represents the first two digits in the calendar year. ISA-09 (interchange date) is an exception and uses YYMMDD.                                                                                    | YYMMDD <ul><li>980127 (`27 Jan 1998`)</li></ul> CCYYMMDD <ul><li>19980127 (`27 Jan 1998`)</li> <li>20220926 (`26 Sep 2022`)</li></ul>                                                                |
| Time                  | TM          | Time is always expressed in 24-hour clock time as follows: HHMM, or HHMMSS, or HHMMSSD, or HHMMSSDD, where H = hours (00-23), M = minutes (00-59), S = integer seconds (00-59) and DD = decimal seconds; decimal seconds are expressed as follows: D = tenths (0-9) and DD = hundredths (00-99). Time elements are usually followed by a qualifier code representing time zone. | HHMM <ul><li>1315 (13:15)</li></ul> HHMMSS <ul><li>131545 (13:15:45)</li></ul> HHMMSSDD <ul><li>13:15:45:233 </li></ul>                                                                              |
| Codes                 | ID          | Most elements with "code" data types have a list of valid codes defined by the X12 standard. These codes are usually "qualifiers" or "values" that are shorthand for a value. Codes are never longer than 4 digits. Some codes are not provided by X12, like 156 (state or province code) or 24 (equipment type).                                                               | Qualifiers <ul><li>ZZ (mutually defined)</li> <li>SF (ship from)</li></ul> Values <ul><li>KG (kilograms)</li></ul> Non-X12 codes <ul><li>US (United States)</li> <li>FHD (FedEx SCAC code)</li></ul> |

### Length (min/max)

Each element is given a minimum and maximum length that they need to adhere to, as per the X12 standard.

The minimum and maximum length can vary from element to element. For example, some elements have fixed lengths like `NTE01` (Note Reference Code) which have a minimum and maximum length of three characters. On the other hand, some elements can contain a wide range of characters, like `NTE02` (Description), which supports a minimum of one character and a maximum of 80.

For elements with the decimal data type (`R`), the count of characters does not include the optional decimal point, minus sign, or trailing exponent indicator `E`.

**Note:** If an element is optional and is not used in a segment, the length restrictions do not apply.

<Image alt="Image of Note Reference Code elements" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/elements/5.png" width="1238px" height="344px" caption="" />

### Position

When an element is used in a segment, it occupies a position in that segment. The X12 standard defines what element is used in every position of a segment. While elements can be referred to by their ID and name (e.g., the `373` Date element in the `BEG`), in-practice element positions are referred to by the segment acronym (e.g., `TDS`), followed by the position of the element in the segment (e.g., `01`). For example, the second element in the `TDS` is `TDS02`, and so on. This is useful for communicating trading-partner requirements, as you can refer to an element as the *TDS05*.

The same element can be found multiple times, in different positions of a single segment. The position, accompanied by semantic notes, determines how to use that element. For example, the element `610` (Amount) is used four times in the `TDS` segment, where the `TDS01` is the total amount of the invoice, and the `TDS04` indicates the total amount of terms discount.

**Note:** If an element is not present, it still occupies a position.

### Requirements

When an element is in the context of a segment, the X12 standard specifies three types of element requirements: mandatory, optional, or conditional. In addition to the requirements given by X12, trading partners will often deviate slightly from the standard to suit their business needs.

* **Mandatory**: Elements marked as mandatory (`M`) must be present in the segment.
* **Optional**: Elements marked as optional (`O`) may be present in the segment.
* **Conditional**: The presence of an element in a segment marked as conditional (`C` or `X`) is dependent on the relational condition syntax rule used.

### Composite & component elements

A composite element contains a collection of component elements (also known as sub-elements). Component elements are functionally the same as the simple elements we explored above, only they have the composite element as the parent, not the segment.

Composite elements also have their own IDs, which begin with `C`. For example, `C040` (Reference Identifier) is a composite data element.

For composite elements, the same position notation (e.g., `REF04`) is used, however, for component elements, the position is given as the name of their parent composite element + `C` + position. For example, the second component element in `REF04` would be referred to as `REF04C02`.


# X12 HIPAA
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/hipaa/index



X12 HIPAA is the common name for the set of specifications businesses use to transmit healthcare transactions in the United States.

A *transaction* is an electronic exchange of information between two parties to carry out financial or administrative activities related to healthcare. For example, a healthcare provider like a hospital may send a claim to a health plan to request payment for medical services.

X12 HIPAA is a narrower subset of the X12 standard. The name refers to the detailed specifications that the X12N Insurance subcommittee have defined. The official term for these specifications is a Technical Report Type 3 (TR3). More commonly, they are called X12 HIPAA implementation guides, though regulators call them federally-mandated operating rules.

## Where can I find X12 HIPAA specifications?

The [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) has [Stedi guides](https://www.stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/guides/index) for every X12 HIPAA transaction set. Stedi guides are interactive, machine-readable EDI specifications that let you instantly validate EDI test files.

You can import any HIPAA guide into your Stedi account and use it to validate and generate EDI. Visit our [Trust Center](https://trust.stedi.com/) to learn more about HIPAA compliance at Stedi.

## Is my trading partner's companion guide the same as an X12 HIPAA specification?

No. A companion guide such as [Anthem's 270/271 companion guide](https://www.anthem.com/docs/public/inline/EDI_CA_00021.PDF) is only an addendum and does not contain the complete information required to understand the specification.

To create a valid transaction, you also need the information contained in the X12 HIPAA implementation guide. Generally, you start with the X12 HIPAA implementation guide and then customize it further using the information in the companion guide.

Companion guides are allowed to be *more* restrictive than the X12 HIPAA implementation guides, but they cannot be *less* restrictive. For example, if the X12 HIPAA implementation guide says that a given field is required, a companion guide provided by a healthcare plan operator cannot say that the field is optional.

By the same token, the X12 HIPAA implementation guides are always more restrictive than the base X12 Release 5010 specification, and they can never be less restrictive.

## Does every healthcare company use the same specification?

No. There are two reasons why healthcare companies don't share the exact same specifications.

First, HHS so far has only mandated the strict use of X12 HIPAA implementation guides (also called operating rules) for a subset of transactions. Refer to the [Operating Rules Mandate](https://www.caqh.org/core/operating-rules-mandate) for complete details.

So, while many companies may choose to adopt the X12 HIPAA implementation guides as a restriction above and beyond the base X12 Release 5010 standard, X12 HIPAA is not strictly required for all transaction sets.

| Transaction Name                                                                   | X12 Transaction Set | Federally Mandated Operating Rules |

| Claim status inquiry and response                                                  | 276/277             | Yes                                |

| Premium payment/explanation (employer)                                             | 820                 | No                                 |
| Enrollment/disenrollment in a health plan                                          | 834                 | No                                 |
| Health claims (institutional, professional, and dental) / coordination of benefits | 837                 | No                                 |

Second, even for transaction sets that have federally mandated operating rules, like the 270 and 271, companies are permitted to implement further constraints. These additional constraints are provided in a companion guide, such as the one Anthem provides for its [270/271](https://www.anthem.com/docs/public/inline/EDI_CA_00021.PDF).

## Why does healthcare use X12 HIPAA?

The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) originally chose X12 as the mandated standard. Standardizing on X12 meant that all parties would use a common transaction structure, which would serve to minimize the industry's proliferation of multiple formats.

### X12 allowed too much flexibility

While HHS found that adopting X12 decreased administrative burden for parties by creating greater uniformity, the flexibility of the X12 standard meant that each health plan used the transaction set standards in different ways. Although the X12 standard constrained the data elements that could be used, an organization was free to impose additional constraints required by their business flow and operations, both in terms of technical constraints and business semantics.

For example, different health plan operators may have allowed for a different number of transactions to be submitted in a single file. They may also have had different opinions about which specific data elements are required for each transaction.

This led each health plan operator to create a companion guide, typically a PDF, that described their unique implementation of the X12 transaction sets. This required trading partners (the providers) to adhere to different transaction implementation rules for each plan operator, subverting the original goal of administrative simplification.

### X12 HIPAA reduces ambiguity

Congress passed laws in 2010 ([Public Law 111-148](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/pdf/PLAW-111publ148.pdf) | [Public Law 111-152](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ152/pdf/PLAW-111publ152.pdf)) requiring HHS to "adopt a single set of operating rules for each transaction\[...]with the goal of creating as much uniformity in the implementation of the electronic standards as possible." The laws mandate that these operating rules "describe all data elements (including reason and remark codes) in unambiguous terms, require that such data elements be required or conditioned upon set values in other fields, and prohibit additional conditions (except where necessary to implement State or Federal law, or to protect against fraud and abuse)."

Essentially, Congress mandated that not only would the healthcare industry needed to use a very specific subset and configuration of the values allowed by X12 in order to "reduce ambiguities currently permitted by the standard." ([Rule by Health and Human Services Department](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/07/08/2011-16834/administrative-simplification-adoption-of-operating-rules-for-eligibility-for-a-health-plan-and)).

As a result, the healthcare industry worked with X12 to form the X12N Insurance committee, which created a detailed specification for each transaction set. These specifications are formally called a Technical Report Type 3 (TR3). The series of TR3s produced by the X12N Insurance committee is what's commonly known as X12 HIPAA.


# Segment repetition in X12 EDI"
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/segments/segment-repetition-in-x12-edi



Sometimes a [segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment) in a transaction set can be repeated. This usually shows up in implementation guides as the `Max Use` of a segment.

<Image alt="Image of max use segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/segment-repetition/max_use.jpg" width="1238px" height="865px" caption="" />

* `1` means that the segment cannot be repeated.
* `>1` means that the segment can be repeated an infinite number of times.
* Any other number means the segment can be repeated at most that number of times.

The X12 standard defines the repetition for each segment, but your trading partner may deviate from the standard in their implementation guide to suit their business needs. In that case, you should follow the implementation guide.

# Qualifiers

You’ll see segment repetitions most often when the segment has a qualifier. A qualifier determines the meaning of a segment. For example, the [DTM segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/DTM) contains a date and it uses a qualifier to tell you if it’s a shipping date, a delivery date, a blind date, etc. It often makes sense to have multiple dates, so the `DTM` segment can be repeated.

```
DTM*011*20220921~
DTM*017*20220922~
```

In the example above, the first segment is the shipping date and the second segment is the estimated delivery date.

In a situation like this, the implementation guide will often deviate from the X12 standard. The standard may say that the `DTM` segment can be repeated, say, 300 times, but if your trading partner only accepts a shipping date and an estimated delivery date, they may set a maximum of 2 repetitions.

## Multiple qualifiers

In most cases, repeated segments do not use the same qualifier more than once. After all, it wouldn’t make much sense to have a single shipment with multiple shipping dates. However, some segments have multiple qualifiers.

For example, the [MEA segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/MEA) represents a measurement. The first qualifier tells you what kind of measurement you’re dealing with, say a weight. The second qualifier tells you what kind of weight. The following example includes both a gross weight and a net weight.

```
MEA*WT*G*1023*LB~
MEA*WT*N*1000*LB~
```

## Repeatable qualifiers

There are also cases where it’s perfectly valid to repeat the same qualifier. For example, a container may have multiple seals. You can use a separate [REF segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/REF) for each seal and they’ll all have the same qualifier.

```
REF*SN*A999001~
REF*SN*A999002~
REF*SN*A999003~
```

# Long data

Every segment has a maximum character count and sometimes, you just need more characters! You’ll typically run into this situation with free-form text segments like [NTE](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/NTE) and [MSG](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/MSG). In that case, you can repeat the segment to fit more data.

```
MSG*Service Terms: The Service Terms below govern your use of the Services. Capitalized terms used in these Service Terms but not defined below are either defined i) in the Stedi Customer Agreement, or ii) in other agreements with us that govern your use of the Servic~
MSG*es (collectively, the “Agreement”). 1. Universal Service Terms (Applicable to all Services) …~

# Segment requirements in X12 EDI
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/segments/segment-requirements-in-x12-edi



When a segment is used in a transaction set, the X12 standard specifies two types of segment requirements: `Mandatory` and `Optional`.

* **Mandatory**: Segments marked as mandatory (`M`) must be present in the EDI transaction.
* **Optional**: Segments marked as optional (`O`) may be present in the EDI transaction.

For each transaction set, the X12 standard defines a base specification, which denotes the requirements of each segment. All segments marked as `M` (mandatory) in the base specification must be present in the EDI file sent between two trading partners. On the other hand, all segments marked as `O` (optional) in the base specification can either be optional or mandatory, depending on the implementation guide that you and your trading partner agree to.

The requirement of a segment is always defined in the context of the transaction set and the position it is used in. For example, a [REF](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/REF) segment might have different requirement parameters if it is used in an [850 Purchase Order](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/850) vs. a [270 Eligibility, Coverage, or Benefit inquiry](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/270). Furthermore, the same segment might be used multiple times in different places in the same transaction set. For example, a [DTM Date/Time Reference](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/DTM) segment could be optional in the `Heading` but mandatory in the `Detail`.

As with all things in X12 EDI, trading partners will create a specification to suit their business needs. For example, your trading partners may decide that some segments — even optional as per the standard — must be present in the data (i.e., are mandatory). On the other hand, according to the X12 standard, you cannot mark segments that are mandatory in the base X12 specification as optional in your guide. In practice, some businesses break the X12 standard and you’ll have to conform to their specification nonetheless.

Most X12 implementation guides used in the industry were built using a tool called SpecBuilder, which creates a standard PDF format. We will use SpecBuilder PDFs and their terminology to explain segment requirements below, but your trading partner might send these requirements in different formats (e.g. CSV, Word, custom PDF).

In these implementation guides, the segment requirements given by X12 are found in the requirement column (`Req` for short). The `Req` column will show which segments are mandatory (`M`) or optional (`O`). Trading partners that deviate from the base specification will often indicate which fields are optional or mandatory in a column called `Usage` or `Attributes`, and they typically use a different syntax, such as `Must use` (mandatory) and `Used` (optional).

<Image alt="Image of segment requirements" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/segment-requirements/img1.jpg" width="1238px" height="865px" caption="" />

Additionally, the segment requirements are also usually found on the segment detail page near the description or header. In these areas, the requirements are also indicated as either mandatory or optional. For trading partner specific requirements, look for the `User Option` or `Usage` label and the `Must use` or `Used` syntax.

<Image alt="Image of segment requirements in segment detail" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/segment-requirements/img4.jpg" width="1238px" height="545px" caption="" />

## X12 types

### Mandatory

Mandatory segments are marked with an `M` or `Mandatory` in most implementation guides. If a segment is defined as mandatory in a transaction set, then you cannot send X12 data without it. In most cases, transactions that are missing mandatory segments will either be stopped by the sender, or rejected by the recipient.

For example, the [BIG (Beginning Segment for Invoice)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/BIG) segment used in all X12 [810 Invoices](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/810) is mandatory. It contains vital invoice information, such as the invoice number and date. You cannot send an invoice without these values.

<Image alt="Image of mandatory BIG segment in 810" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/segment-requirements/img3.jpg" width="1238px" height="865px" caption="" />

<Image alt="Image of mandatory BIG segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/segment-requirements/img4.jpg" width="1238px" height="545px" caption="" />

### Optional

Optional segments are marked with an `O` or `Optional` in most implementation guides.

If a segment is marked as optional, it can be omitted in the data and the transaction would still be valid. Often, PDF specifications will explain when to use optional segments in a notes section.

For example, the [CUR (Currency)](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/CUR) segment used in X12 810 Invoices is optional. Trading partners might agree that the default currency is US Dollars and use `CUR` only when the invoice currency is different from US Dollars.

<Image alt="Image of optional CUR segment in 810" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/segment-requirements/img5.jpg" width="1238px" height="865px" caption="" />

<Image alt="Image of optional CUR segment" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/segment-requirements/img6.png" width="1238px" height="591px" caption="" />

# What is a segment in X12 EDI?
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/segments/what-is-a-segment



Segments in X12 EDI contain a group of logically related [elements](https://www.stedi.com/edi/essentials/x12/elements) that are combined to communicate specific information between two trading partners. Each X12 transaction consists of segments sent in a pre-defined sequence, where each segment is separated from one another by segment terminators (e.g., `~`, `\n`, etc.). For example, here is a snippet of an [850 Purchase Order](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/850) that contains a `BEG` and `CUR` segment.

```
BEG***00*AB*308174864**20220321~
CUR***BY*USD~
```

The X12 standard defines a list of [thousands of segments](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment), and each segment has a unique segment ID, name, description, and a set of elements that it contains. These segment attributes are fixed; they do not change, regardless of what transaction set they are sent in. Most segments appear in many transaction sets, while others are unique to individual transaction sets.

When a segment is used in a transaction set, the X12 standard provides additional attributes, such as its sequence, requirement, and repetition. These attributes are variable; they change based on which transaction set the segment is found in.

## Segment attributes

### IDs

Each segment is given a unique ID that can be two to three characters in length, and may be a combination of letters, or letters and numbers. For example, the `Party Identification` segment has the ID `N1`, the `Tax Reference` segment has the ID `TAX`, and the `Date/Time` segment has the ID `G62`. Sometimes, the segment ID is referred to as the *segment name* or *tag*.

<Image alt="Image of unique segment ID" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/1.png" srcDarkMode="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/1dark.png" width="1038px" height="350px" caption="" />

### Names

Each segment is given a name, which is a short, generic description of what the purpose of the segment is. For example, the name of the `ACK` segment is `Line Item Acknowledgement`, the name of the `AT1` segment is `Bill of Lading Line Item Number`, and the name of the `ITA` is `Allowance, Charge or Service`. While each segment is given a name, in practice, the segment ID is used for identifying the segment, not the name.

<Image alt="Image of segment name" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/2.png" srcDarkMode="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/2dark.png" width="1040px" height="356px" caption="" />

### Descriptions

In addition to the segment name, X12 provides a longer description to explain what the segment represents and how it is used. For example, the `BEG` segment (Beginning Segment for Purchase Order) has the following description:

> To indicate the beginning of the Purchase Order Transaction Set and transmit identifying numbers and dates.

<Image alt="Image of segment description" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/3.png" srcDarkMode="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/3dark.png" width="1140px" height="354px" caption="" />

### Elements

Every segment contains one or more elements sent in a pre-defined order. Regardless of which transaction set the segment is found in, the segment always contains the same list of elements. However, depending on the element requirements of that segment and your trading partners implementation guide, some elements are considered optional.

You can read more about elements and how they are used in the [Elements in X12 EDI](https://www.stedi.com/edi/essentials/x12/elements) article.

### Sequence

For every transaction set, the X12 standard defines which segments can be sent and in what order. The order is defined by the sequence number (sometimes called position) that the segment has in the context of that transaction set.

For example, in the [180 Return Merchandise Authorization and Notification](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/180) transaction, the `ST` segment (Transaction Set Header) is the first segment that indicates a new transaction is being sent and so it is given the 0100 position of the transaction. The `BGN` segment is next up in the sequence, and has the `0200` position. `RDR` has `0300`, `PRF` has `0400`, and so on. The position number has no semantic meaning, it is purely to indicate where a segment goes in the context of its neighbors. Even if a segment is not used or sent, the position of the following segments do not change.

<Image alt="Image of segment sequence" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/4.png" srcDarkMode="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/4dark.png" width="1252px" height="986px" caption="" />

Depending on the transaction set, the same segment can be used multiple times in different positions. The sequence number is useful here because it can help disambiguate which iteration of the segment a trading partner is referring to.

For example, the `DTM` (Date/Time Reference) segment is found four times in the `180` transaction; once at the `0500` position, again at the `0520` position, again at the `1300` position, and finally at the `1900` position. On the other hand, the `252` Insurance Producer Administration transaction only contains one `DTM` segment at the `0040` position.

While segment positions are useful for validation and debugging, in practice they are rarely used to describe a segment. For example, it’s rare to hear someone refer to the `DTM` as “the DTM at the 140 position.” Moreover, these positions are not always correctly calculated in the implementation guides so you shouldn’t rely on them. Instead, use the logical structure of the transaction set (e.g., heading, detail, summary, and/or loops) to explain the position.

For example, the implementation guide of the `810` invoice below defines three `REF` segments with positions `050`, `110` and `120`. So, instead of using the positions (050, 110, or 120) you can refer to them as:

* REF under the Heading
* REF in the N1 loop
* REF under detail

<Image alt="Image of segment sequence" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/segments-ref.jpg" width="1194px" height="865px" caption="" />

### Requirements

When a segment is used in a transaction set, the X12 standard specifies two types of segment requirements: mandatory or optional. In addition to the X12 requirements, trading partners will often deviate slightly from the standard to suit their business needs.

* **Mandatory**: segments marked as mandatory (`M`) must be present in the EDI transaction.
* **Optional**: segments marked as optional (`O`) may be present in the EDI transaction.

According to X12, trading partners can mark optional segments as mandatory, but they should not mark mandatory segments as optional. Additionally, while some implementation guides will mark the first segment of a loop as optional, technically all segments that are the first segment in the loop are required.

### Repetition

While some segments might be present in more than one position in a single transaction set, repetition pertains to something else. The repetition attribute determines how many time the same segment or loop can be repeated in the same position. On implementation guides, this is usually referred to as the `Max Use` of a segment.

The repetition of a segment in a transaction set can be indicated by one of the following:

* `1`, which means this segment cannot be repeated.
* Any number greater than one, which means this segment may be repeated up to, but no more than, the number indicated.
* `>1`, which means that this segment can be repeated an infinite number of times

<Image alt="Image of segment repetition" src="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/5.png" srcDarkMode="/edi/images/docs/x12/segments/5dark.png" width="1240px" height="518px" caption="" />


# Split inbound EDI files with fragments
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/fragments/inbound-fragments



<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

Once you [configure fragments](/edi-platform/fragments/index) for an inbound transaction setting, Stedi splits the translated transaction payload into chunks based on the selected segment.

## Processing events

Stedi emits two types of events for inbound transactions with fragments enabled: `transaction.processed.v2` and `fragment.processed.v2`.

For example, if you enable fragments on the `LIN` loop in an 846 Inventory Inquiry/Advice, Stedi will fragment a translated 846 file and emit the following events:

* One [`transaction.processed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#transaction-processed) for each unique transaction set that was included in the original file.
* One or more [`fragment.processed.v2` events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#transaction-processed). Each fragment contains several iterations of the `LIN` loop (inventory items).

## Ingest fragments

You have two options for ingesting fragments from processed inbound transactions into your downstream system.

### Fragment processed events

Configure a [webhook](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/configure-webhooks) for fragment processed events. As Stedi emits these events, use the [Get Fragment](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-transaction-fragment-detail) endpoint to retrieve each processed fragment from Stedi.

### Transaction processed events

Configure a [webhook](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/configure-webhooks) for transaction processed events only. After you receive a transaction processed event, use the API to retrieve associated fragments in batches according to your system's requirements.

The event payload includes a `fragments` object with general information about the fragments that Stedi created.

## Retrieve inbound transaction with fragments

Stedi does not store the complete transaction for inbound files with fragments enabled. When you use Stedi's [Get Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-transactions) endpoint to retrieve inbound transactions with fragments, Stedi always returns the fragment wrapper (the transaction minus fragments).

You cannot retrieve the complete transaction with fragments included - you must use the [Get Fragment](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-transaction-fragment-detail) endpoint to retrieve the fragments separately.


# Fragments: Split transactions into smaller chunks
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/fragments/index



<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

Large files are often the result of transaction sets containing many repeated loops or segments. For example, a healthcare provider may send an [837 Health Care Claim](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-claim-professional-x222a2/01GRYB6EJ999Y6MZ53ZBAHYBHE) containing many individual claims, or a brand may send an [846 Inventory Inquiry/Advice](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/transaction-set/846) file containing millions of SKUs.

The translation ratio of an EDI file to JSON typically approaches 1:10, so a translated JSON artifact will be multiple times the size of the original EDI file. To avoid overwhelming downstream systems, you can use fragments to split translated inbound transactions from Stedi into smaller, more manageable chunks.

You can also use fragments when generating large outbound EDI files. You send transaction data to Stedi in chunks over time, and Stedi stiches the chunks together to generate a complete EDI file for your trading partner.

## Configure fragments

You need to configure your Stedi guide to use fragments and then create an inbound or outbound transaction setting using that guide.

### Stedi guide

You can enable fragments for one repeated EDI segment in each transaction set. To enable fragments within a Stedi guide:

1. Go to the [Guides](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides) page and edit the guide you want to update.
2. Click the node (segment) in the guide that you want to use to split the file. The node must be a looping data structure, such as an HL loop containing inventory items.
3. Toggle **Set as fragment** to `ON`.
4. Publish the changes to your guide.

### Transaction setting

Once you have enabled fragments on the Stedi guide, create a [transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings#create-transaction-settings) with the guide.

* **Inbound transaction settings**: You must explicitly toggle **Enable fragments** to `ON`. You can use the default batch size (800 segments) or set a custom batch size (up to 50,000 segments).
* **Outbound transaction settings**: No additional configuration is required.

You can now use fragments to split large [inbound transactions](/edi-platform/fragments/inbound-fragments) or generate large [outbound transactions](/edi-platform/fragments/outbound-fragments).


# Generate outbound EDI files with fragments
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/fragments/outbound-fragments



<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

Once you [configure fragments](/edi-platform/fragments/index) for a transaction type, you can use Stedi's APIs to generate EDI files from fragments.

For example, if you enable fragments on the `INS` loop in an 834 Health Care Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance, you can send batches of `INS` loops to Stedi's [Stage Fragment API](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/post-fragments), and Stedi will securely store them until you're ready to send the complete file.

Once you stage all the fragments, you call the [Create Outbound Transaction API](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) to combine the fragments together into a single EDI file and deliver it to your trading partner.

## Find the Guide JSON Schema

Unless you're using [mappings](/edi-platform/mappings), you must send fragments in [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json), a JSON format that matches the JSON Schema of the guide associated with the outbound transaction setting.

To find the JSON Schema for a fragment:

1. Navigate to the [Trading partners page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships).
2. Select the partnership.
3. Click the name of the guide associated with the outbound transaction setting.
4. Open the **Actions** menu and select **View schema**.
5. Find the segment that you selected to split the file. The shape for that segment is the JSON Schema you must use when sending fragments to Stedi.

The following example shows the JSON Schema for the `INS` loop in an 834 Healthcare Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance transaction.

<Accordion title="Example JSON Schema for an 834 INS loop">
  <Snippet file="example-json-schema-ins-loop.mdx" />
</Accordion>

## Find the mapping ID and schema

If you plan to use a mapping to transform fragments into Stedi’s Guide JSON format, you must send fragments to Stedi's API in the mapping's source JSON schema.

To find the mapping ID and schema:

1. Go to the [Mappings page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/mappings) and copy the **ID** field for the mapping you want to use.
2. Click the mapping's name to view its details.
3. Click **Test mapping**. The test input JSON shape is the shape you must use when sending fragment data to the Stage Fragment API.

## Stage fragments

Call the [Stage Fragments API](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/post-fragments) to store a fragment on Stedi until you are ready to generate an outbound EDI file.

Stedi stores fragments in groups, specified by the `fragmentGroupID` included in the path. You can call the API with the same `fragmentGroupID` as many times as needed until you have staged all of the fragments required for the transaction.

### Data format

For each staging call, you can optionally specify a mapping that Stedi will use to transform the fragment from your system's JSON format into Stedi’s Guide JSON format.

* If you don’t use a mapping, the fragment must match the Guide JSON format for the specified guide.
* If you use a mapping, the fragment must match the mapping's source JSON schema.

### Sample request and response

The following example shows a cURL request and response for staging a fragment without a mapping. The fragment contains iterations of the `PO1` loop in an 850 Purchase Order.

<Snippet file="api-examples/core/stage-fragments.mdx" />

## Create outbound transaction

Call the [Create Outbound Transaction API](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) and Stedi combines all of the fragments matching the `fragmentGroupId` into a single, compliant EDI file and delivers it to your trading partner.

Once you call the Transaction API with a `fragmentGroupId`, that ID is locked, meaning that you cannot add new fragments to the group and you cannot call the API again with that ID. This feature prevents you from accidentally sending duplicate data to partners.

### Data format

When calling the API with fragments, you provide a *fragment wrapper* for the transaction. The wrapper contains all of the transaction data except for the contents of the repeated loop segment where Stedi should insert the fragments. Instead, you leave an empty array in place of the loop contents - for example, `member_level_detail_INS_loop: []`.

<Accordion title="Fragment wrapper for an 834 Benefit Enrollment">
  ```json
  "transaction": {
      "heading": {

      },
      "detail": {
          "member_level_detail_INS_loop": []
      }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

You can optionally provide a mapping ID to transform the fragment wrapper from your system's JSON format into Stedi’s Guide JSON format. If you don't use a mapping, the fragment wrapper must match the Guide JSON format for the specified guide.

### Sample request and response

The following example shows a cURL request and response to generate an [834 Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/benefit-enrollment-and-maintenance-x220a1/01GRYB6D6RAWSG8ATBD6GXM13C). Notice that the `member_level_detail_INS_loop` is an empty array - this is where Stedi will insert the fragments from the specified fragment group.

<Snippet file="api-examples/core/create-transaction-with-fragments.mdx" />

## Retrieve an outbound transaction with fragments

Call the [Get Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-transactions) endpoint to retrieve the full transaction, including the fragment data. Note that the full transaction, including fragments, can be very large.


# Integration steps
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/getting-started/first-integration



Complete the following steps to configure and test your first EDI integration on Stedi.

## Configure your first trading partner

Time: About 15 minutes

To set up a new trading partner, you'll need to configure the following settings:

* [Partnership](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/profiles-and-partnerships): Partnerships describe all aspects of the EDI relationship between you and your trading partner, including which transaction sets you plan to exchange and other important information for processing.
* [Connections](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections): Within the partnership, define SFTP/FTP/FTPS and AS2 connections to exchange data with partners.
* [Transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings): Within the partnership, define the inbound and outbound transaction sets you plan to exchange with your trading partner. As part of this process, you'll choose which EDI specifications to use to validate the data.

## Send webhooks to your system

Time: About 5 minutes

Each time Stedi processes an EDI file from a trading partner, you will want to ingest the transactions into your downstream system. You can do this by configuring a [webhook](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index) to send [transaction.processed.v2\` events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#transaction-processed) to your API, Cloud functions, IPaaS platforms, or ERP systems. Then, you can programmatically retrieve the processed transaction data from Stedi.

You can also configure webhooks for other events, like when a processing error occurs. You can use this approach to trigger alerts in systems like Slack, PagerDuty, or Zendesk for further review.

## Process an inbound test file

Time: About 2 minutes

Once you have configured your first trading partner and a webhook, you can process a test file to make sure your partner configuration is working correctly. If you don't want to wait for a test file from your partner, you can also [generate a test file](/edi-platform/operate/generate-test-files).

When the test file is successfully processed, you will receive a webhook for each included transaction.

## Send an outbound test file

Time: About 2 minutes

You can [send a test file](/edi-platform/operate/generate-test-files) to your partner from within the browser.

This is also useful for understanding what data is required to call the [Generate API](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi) programmatically from your system. You can export cURL commands to use as a starting point for your live integration.

## Configure data transformations

Time: A few hours

To complete your integration, [choose an approach](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/transformation-approaches) to transform [Stedi Guide JSON format](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) into and out of the format your internal systems can understand.


# Gather requirements
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/getting-started/gather-requirements



Complete the following steps in preparation for onboarding your first trading partner. Please [contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) with any questions.

## Project planning

Work with your team to determine the following details:

* **Trading partner:** Select a trading partner to integrate with. If you have multiple trading partners, we recommend starting with the partner that is either easiest to work with or that has the earliest implementation deadline.
* **Timeline:** Determine your ideal implemention timeline and any hard deadlines for when the integration must be production-ready. Communicate these to your customer success engineer as soon as possible.
* **Team members:** Identify the team members who will be involved in the integration. We recommend at least one project or program manager to communicate with trading partners and keep the integration on track and one engineer or technical team member.
* [EDI IDs](#edi-ids): You need IDs for both your business and your trading partner before you can configure your Stedi account.

## Contact your trading partner

Ask your trading partner for the following information. You and your customer success engineer will use it to configure your account.

### EDI requirements

Create a list of all the EDI transaction types that you plan to send or receive. For example, you may plan to send 850 Purchase Orders and receive 810 Invoices.

* **Guides:** Ask your partner for the most up-to-date EDI requirements for each transaction type. Your partner may provide these as PDF, Excel, or Word documents.
  <Tip>
    These requirements may already be available in the [Stedi
    Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network). If so, we'll use the documents
    you provide to ensure the Network guides are up-to-date. If not, we'll add
    the guides you need to the Network in 1-2 business days.
  </Tip>

### EDI IDs

Determine the following IDs for both you and your trading partner. You can use the IDs in existing production EDI files or ask your trading partner to provide them.

* [ISA ID](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/ISA#ISA-06): Codes included in each EDI file's ISA header (`ISA-06` or `ISA-08`) to identify your and your partner's organization. This is usually a derivative of the company name. For example, `AMAZONDS` for Amazon Dropshipping.
* [ISA Qualifier](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/ISA#ISA-05): The type of ISA ID. If you're not sure what to choose for your business, we recommend `ZZ (Mutually Defined)`.
* [Application Code](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12-008010/segment/GS#GS-02): Codes included in each EDI file's GS header (`GS-02` or `GS-03`) to identify your and your partner's organization. The Application Code for a business is typically the same as its ISA ID, but not always.

<Tip>
  If you're new to EDI, we can help you choose values for your business.
</Tip>

### Connection protocol

Determine how you will exchange EDI files with your partner and gather configuration details.

* **Stedi-hosted SFTP/FTPS (recommended):** No additional information is required for configuration. We'll provide credentials your partner can use to connect to the server.
* **Remote SFTP/FTPS:** If your partner is hosting the remote server, ask them to provide the following information:
  * Protocol - FTP, FTPS, SFTP
  * Host - server URL/address
  * Port number
  * Password or key passphrase
  * Root directory
  * Directories to retrieve files from your trading partner (inbound) and to deliver files to your trading partner (outbound)
* **AS2:** This connection type is complex. If your partner requires AS2, we will discuss the requirements during your onboarding call. You can also check out our [AS2 documentation](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/as2/as2-overview) for more information.

### Sample EDI files

Gather production EDI files or ask your partner for sample files that you can use to test the integration.

Trading partners often send files that do not fully conform to their official EDI requirements, so it's critical to test your pipeline with real-world data before your go-live date.


# EDI platform overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/getting-started/index



In addition to our [Healthcare APIs](/healthcare), Stedi offers a platform for building and managing end-to-end EDI systems in any industry. The platform encapsulates the complexity of EDI and helps you integrate with external systems, such as ERPs, iPaaS platforms, and custom applications.

## Build an EDI system on Stedi

Stedi acts as an EDI translation layer.

You send JSON to Stedi, and Stedi generates EDI files and delivers them to your trading partners. Your trading partners send EDI to Stedi, and Stedi automatically translates those files into JSON and sends them to your business systems.

![Inbound and Outbound file processing flow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/diagrams/inbound-outbound-flow.svg)

There are two main aspects to building an EDI system on Stedi.

### Onboard trading partners

Anyone, regardless of their technical background or EDI experience, can add a trading partner configuration to Stedi in about 15 minutes. This involves defining the transaction sets you plan to exchange with that partner and the communication methods you plan to use (e.g. SFTP/FTPS or AS2).

We can help you during a free onboarding call, or you can follow our [step-by-step instructions](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/).

### Integrate Stedi with internal systems

After you configure your trading partner, you will set up pipelines to get transaction data into and out of Stedi. A developer can do this, or our [onboarding team](https://www.stedi.com/contact) can do it for you for free.

* For each inbound transaction you receive from your trading partner, you can set up webhooks that forward processed data and events from Stedi to your systems.
* For each outbound transaction you want to send to your trading partner, you can make a Stedi API call to generate and deliver fully-formed EDI files.

As part of this process, you will [transform transaction data](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/transforming-data) to and from a format that your internal systems can understand.


# Advanced: Build Stedi guides
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/guides/customize-guides



You can create, import, and customize guides for any of the 300+ X12 transaction sets.

Most users don't need to build custom guides - we strongly recommend importing your trading partner's guides from the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) into your account for free.

However, many trading partners send EDI files that are not 100% compliant with their official guide for a transaction set. For example, they may use different codes for an element. In these cases, you can edit existing guides so that they accurately represent the EDI files you receive.

<Tip>
  **Not sure what to fix?** If you received a guide-related file execution
  error, [contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for help updating your
  guide to fix the issue.
</Tip>

## Edit existing guides

Go to your [Stedi account](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides) and find the guide you want to edit.

To edit, click the **ellipses (…)** next to the guide and select **Edit**. The guide opens in the guide builder.

## Create guides

You can create a custom guide from the base specification for a transaction set from any X12 release. To create a guide:

1. Go to your [Stedi account](https://portal.stedi.com/app) and click **Create guide**.
2. Select an **X12 Release** and the **Transaction Set** base specfication you want to customize.
3. Enter a unique **Name** for your guide and click **Create**. The new guide opens in the guide builder.

## Lock guides

When you're finished editing, you can lock a guide to prevent further updates. Locking helps prevent accidental changes or deletions to guides in production.

Any user in your Stedi account can lock guides, but only an account admin can unlock guides.

To lock a guide, go to the **Actions** menu and select **Lock**. No one can update, delete, or publish a locked guide. However, you can duplicate locked guides, if needed.

To unlock the guide, an admin can go to the **Actions** menu and select **Unlock**.

## Segments and Loops

By default, the guide builder only lists the [segments](https://www.stedi.com/edi/essentials/x12/segments) required in the base transaction set. You can add additional segments to your custom guide.

To add additional segments:

1. Click either **Heading**, **Detail**, or **Summary** in the left sidebar to view a list of the possible segments for that section.
2. Click the box next to each segment to change whether it is included in the transaction set.
   * `R`: Required. Note: Some PDF implementation guides use a designation of `M` (for Mandatory) instead. In these cases, `R` is still the appropriate choice.
   * `O`: Optional.
   * `N`: Not used by this implementation guide.

### Hierarchical Levels

An `HL` segment identifies dependencies between hierarchically related data segments. For example, there may be hierarchical relationships between components of packing information in an [856 Ship Notice](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/transaction-set/856).

#### Example use case

Consider the following hierarchical information about customer grocery orders.

```
ORD02208
  ├── Package
      ├── Milk
```

The following EDI example shows the HL loops that define this information.

```
HL*1**O*1~
PRF*ORD02208***20220815~
HL*2*1*P*1~
TD1*CTN*1~
REF*CN*1B487311569~
HL*3*2*I*0~
LIN*D002*BN*75206331361~
SN1**1*EA~
PID*F*TRN***MILK~
```

The first `HL` segment defines the order at the highest level of the hierarchy. It has four elements.

| Element | Name             | Description                                               |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HL-01` | ID Number        | Identifies this entry of the HL loop.                     |
| `HL-02` | Parent ID Number | The ID Number of the order that this package relates to.  |
| `HL-03` | Level Code       | Specifies the type of the entry. In this case, a package. |
| `HL-04` | Child Code       | Specifies whether this entry has children. `1` means yes. |

Then, the document continues:

* The `PRF` segment contains information about the order itself, including the order number `ORD02208`.
* The `HL` segment repeats when the order becomes a package, and the package itself is described by the segments `TD1` and `REF`.
* the `HL` segment repeats once more when the order contains an item, and the item itself is described by the segments `LIN`, `SN1`, and `PID`.

#### Add an HL loop to your guide

X12 does not enforce a specific hierarchy in your transaction set. You can add `HL` loops to your Stedi guide to define the hierarchical relationships you need for your use case.

You must add `HL` loops to your guides one level at a time. For example, you would create three nested `HL` segments to capture the following hierarchy.

```
Order
  ├── Package
      ├── Item
```

To add an `HL` loop for this scenario:

1. Click the **DETAIL** heading in the left sidebar.
2. Click the box next to the HL Loop to change its status from **Not Used**.
3. Choose a code to describe the type of entry for this level of the hierarchy. In this example, you would choose `O` for order.
4. Click **Save** to add the HL segment under **DETAIL**.
5. Click the HL Loop, scroll to the list of HL segments.
6. Click the box next to **HL Loop** to add it and select a code. In this example, you'd select `P` for package.
7. Repeat this process for the final hierarchy level describing the item.

#### HL Loop Variations

Sometimes, an implementation guide allows for variations of a hierarchy. For example, if a ship notice only has one package, you can leave out the package information.

You can convey this information to your trading partners by creating [variants](#variants) within a single Stedi guide or by creating a separate Stedi guide for each variant.

### Variants

Loops and segments allow you to create variants. A variant is a specific version of a loop or a segment that is used in a particular context.

To create a variant, go to the segment and click **+ Create variant** under the **Variant group** section.

#### Variant sequence

Some trading partners require that you send certain iterations of loops or segments before others. To address these requirements, specify the **Variant sequence**, or position number, for each variant. This approach ensures that the variants appear in a specific order when you use this guide to write EDI.

Variants with lower numbers are written before higher numbers, and variants without a defined sequence are written last.

You can only set the variant sequence for loops or segments with a variant defined. To set the variant sequence, click the loop or segment you want to edit and open the **Advanced** menu.

#### Discriminants

Variants must be uniquely identifiable from each other. To do this, you must add a discriminant that differentiates each variant. The discriminant tells Stedi when one variant should be used over the other for validating, generating, or parsing EDI documents.

For example, you could specify that partners include two `N1 Name` loops in each `850` Purchase Order: one for the ship to contact and another for the bill to party. In this case you'd add the Entity Identifier Code as the discriminant for `N1 Name` loops. For the `bill to` variant, you'd use the `BT` qualifier, and for the ship to variant, you'd use the `ST` qualifier.

The type of discriminant depends on whether the loop is hierarchical:

* For hierarchical loops (HL loops), set a unique HL Level Code (`HL-03`) on each variant.
* For non-hierarchical loops and segments, set a unique allowed value on each variant.

You do not need to place the discriminant on the first element of the first segment. You can place it in any required element of the first segment. The only requirement is that the discriminant must be unique amongst all variants.

## Elements

By default, the guide builder only includes the [elements](https://www.stedi.com/edi/essentials/x12/elements) for each segment that are required in the base transaction set. You can add additional elements to your custom guide.

To add or remove elements from a segment:

1. Click the segment's name and scroll to find the list of possible elements.
2. Click the box next to each element to change whether it is included in the segment.

<Tip>
  Some PDF guides have elements marked as conditional (`X`). These have special
  rules associated with them. At this step, you should mark them as optional.
</Tip>

### Conditional elements

Some elements come with conditions that tell you when they should be included. For example, if you specify a date in the [date/time-segment](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/G62), you must also specify a date qualifier. Similarly, if you specify a time, you must also specify a time qualifier. You can specify either a date or a time, but you must include at least one.

Every condition begins with a letter that specifies the type of condition, followed by one or more element numbers to which the condition applies. For example, `R0103` means that you must specify at least one of the elements `01` or `03`.

It’s possible to specify more than two elements, so `R010304` would mean that you must specify at least one of the elements `01`, `03`, or `04`.

| **Letter** | **Name**         | **Condition**                                                                             |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `C`        | Condition        | If the first element is present, then all the other elements must be present.             |
| `E`        | Exclusive        | Only one of the elements may be present.                                                  |
| `L`        | List conditional | If the first element is present, then at least one of the other elements must be present. |
| `P`        | Paired           | If one of the elements is present, then all elements must be present.                     |
| `R`        | Required         | At least one of the elements must be present.                                             |

#### Add Conditions

You must specify conditions for elements on the segment level. To add conditions:

1. Click the segment name in the left sidebar.
2. Scroll to the **Conditions** section in the center column and click **+ Add condition**.

<Tip>
  Learn more about [X12 EDI relational
  conditions](/edi-platform/edi-essentials/x12/elements/relational-conditions-in-x12-edi)
  in our EDI Reference documentation.
</Tip>

### Data type and length

Every element has a specific data type and length. Your guide automatically copies the data type and length settings from the base specification for the transaction set. Implementation guides typically use the same data type and length as the base specification, so we recommend leaving the default settings as is, unless you have a specific reason for updating them.

To edit the element's data type, click the element name in the sidebar and open the **Advanced** menu in the center column.

#### Maximum length of numeric elements

Numeric elements in Stedi Guides have a maximum length of 15. This differs from the X12 specification, which does not enforce a maximum length for numeric data element types. The reason for this discrepancy is that most common programming languages and libraries deserialize JSON numbers to double precision floating point numbers, which have a maximum of 15 digits of precision. This maximum length ensures that numbers do not have their value changed in the process.

By default, Guides has reduced the length of certain X12 data elements to improve usability. For example, X12 element `[212 Unit Price](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/element/212)` has a maximum length of 17. In Guides, this is reduced to 15 by default, since very few use cases legitimately require 17 digits of pricing precision.

If you need additional digits of precision, you can always change a numeric field to a string, which allows you to choose an arbitrary length.

When working with numbers where precision is important, we recommend deserializing to decimal types with the appropriate precision for your business case.

### Allowed values

Many elements have a value based on a standardized list of codes. For example, the date/time segment has the date qualifier segment, which indicates the type of date to include. The base specifiation lists well over a hundred possible codes. The implementation guide should list which ones are valid for you.

To update the list of accepted codes for an element:

1. Click the element's name in the left sidebar.
2. Scroll to the **Allowed values** section in the center column and click **+ Add code value**.
3. Add one or more codes that are appropriate for your use cases.

## Delimiters

Delimiters separate the segments and elements in an EDI file.

When you create a guide, you can set delimiters in the *Overview* pane in the top left. Stedi uses the guide's delimiters when [writing EDI](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi).
As a default, Stedi recommends the following choices:

* Element: `*`
* Segment: `~`
* Repetition: `^`
* Component Element: `>`

Other common choices for the component element include `:`, `<`, and `\`.

Choosing delimiters for reading and writing EDI depends on your and your trading partner's data requirements. Clearly communicate the character restrictions with the business groups that are sending the data. You should also agree on substitution characters when a delimiter appears in the data. For example, if your delimiter is `*` and you know incoming data contains mathematical expressions, you could agree to use `x` instead of `*` for relevant expressions (`4x2` instead of `4*2`).

### Writing EDI

Stedi will parse your data incorrectly if the delimiter you choose appears elsewhere in your data. For example, if your input uses mathematical symbols, then we recommend choosing `:` or `\` instead of `>` and `<` as delimiters. Likewise, you may want to avoid `:` if your text data includes time values in `HH:MM:SS` format. We recommend considering the following guidance from the X12 documentation.

The following characters usually occur in data. They should not be used as delimiters:

* Upper (`A-Z`) and lowercase (`a-z`) letters
* Digits (`0-9`)
* Blank space (` `)
* Minus sign (`-`)

The following characters often appear in data. Use as delimiter characters with caution.

```
" ! & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; ? =
```

The following characters sometimes appear in data. Use as delimiter characters with caution.

```
% @ [ ] \_ { } \ | < > ~ ^ `

```

### Reading EDI

#### Delimiters

We recommend allowing your trading partners to use any type of delimiter when sending data. They may have different data requirements and have likely already worked to ensure there are no conflicts with EDI delimiters.

Stedi automatically infers the delimiters from incoming EDI files.

#### X12 guidance for delimiters

X12 provides the following guidance about delimiters.

The following characters usually occur in data. They should not be used as delimiters:

* Upper (`A-Z`) and lowercase (`a-z`) letters
* Digits (`0-9`)
* Blank space (` `)
* Minus sign (`-`)

The following characters often appear in data. Use as delimiter characters with caution.

```
" ! & ' ( ) \* + , - . / : ; ? =
```

The following characters sometimes appear in data. Use as delimiter characters with caution.

```
% @ [ ] \_ { } \ | < > ~ ^ `
```

## Attachments

You can attach files to any Stedi guide and choose whether the attachments are public or private (only available to members of your Stedi account).

For example, you may want to add private attachments that help your team debug issues in your EDI pipeline, such as the original PDF specifications or a changelog. For a public guide, you may want to attach an appendix with a supplementary code list or a diagram that helps your partners understand the messaging flow.

To add attachments to a guide in your account, navigate to its **Overview** page, scroll to the **Attachments** section, and click **Attach file**.

## Sample EDI files for public guides

You can include multiple EDI sample files in Stedi guides to help new trading partners understand valid usage patterns faster and reduce onboarding time. The guide builder automatically validates each sample against the guide's specifications, so you can fix any errors before you provide them to trading partners.

You can also add a description to each sample that gives trading partners even more context about the intended use cases. The description appears at the top of the guide's EDI Inspector.

To add samples:

1. Click **Overview** in the left sidebar and scroll to the **EDI Samples** section in the center column. Click on **+ Add Sample**.
2. In the **EDI Sample** tab, add a **Name** and paste a sample file or customize an autogenerated sample based on the guide's specifications.
3. You may add an an optional **Description** in the **Description** tab.
4. Click **Create sample**.

EDI samples attached to the guide are used:

1. In the [Generate EDI test file](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi#send-test-files-in-the-browser) flow.
2. On your [public guide's](/edi-platform/guides/public-guides) interactive web page and are included when partners download the guide as a PDF.


# Import Stedi Guides
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/guides/import-guides



Most users don't need to create custom guides from scratch. Instead, we recommend importing guides from the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) into your Stedi account.

### Import from our Network (Recommended)

To import your partner’s EDI guides:

1. Open the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) in a new tab.
2. Locate the trading partner and guide you want to import.

* Choose a **Name** for the guide and then click **Import**. A private copy of the guide appears in your Stedi account.

## Enable importing

You can enable an import link that allows other users to add a copy of a private guide into their Stedi account. When enabled, anyone with the import link can access your account name, guide name, and guide definition. You can disable import links at any time.

To enable an import link, click the **ellipses (...)** next to a guide and select **Share import link**. Toggle **Enable import link** on.


# Guides overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/guides/index



EDI implementation guides define the format for a particular EDI transaction type. Stedi guides are a machine-readable version of the implementation guides your partners would typically provide to you as PDF, Word, or Excel files.

When you attach a guide to a [transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings), Stedi uses it to validate and translate (inbound) or generate (outbound) the EDI files you exchange with your partner.

## Stedi Network

Stedi has thousands of pre-built guides available in the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) catalog. Once you find your partner's guides, click **Import guide into your account** to add a copy to your Stedi account. Then, you can add the guide to any partnership's [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings#using-guides).

## View guides

You can view a list of all your guides on the **Guides** tab in your [Stedi account](https://portal.stedi.com/app).


# Public Guides
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/guides/public-guides



Guides are private by default. Only members of your Stedi account can use private guides.

When you [make a guide public](#make-a-guide-public), your trading partners can view it as interactive web page and validate EDI documents against it instantly in their web browsers. Visit the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) for examples.

When a guide is public, anyone with the link can:

* View the guide web page
* Print the guide
* Troubleshoot EDI files using the EDI Inspector.

## Make a guide public

To make a guide public, click the **ellipses (...)** next to the guide and select **Make public**. You can revert a public guide back to private at any time.

## Share public guide URL

After the guide is public, you can send its public URL to your trading partners and link to your guides from your own website. To copy a public guide's URL:

* Click the public guide to open it in the guide builder.
* Click **Actions**.
* Click the icon next to **View public guide** to copy the guide's public URL.

## Published guide settings

You can use **Published guide settings** to customize the appearance of your public guides. These settings apply to all published guides.

To change your published guide settings:

1. On the guides overview page, click **Published guide settings**.
2. You can adjust the following settings:
   * **Logo:** If not specified, the guide displays your Stedi account name.
   * **Company display name:** If not specified, the guide displays your Stedi account name.
   * **URL slug**: If not specified, the slug is a hyphenated version of your account name.
   * (Optional) **Include link:** If set to `ON`, you can add a custom link to the top of each public guide. For example, you may want to link to a particular page of your company's website.
   * If you include a link, specify the **Link Label**, which is the button text for your custom link and the **Link url**.


# What is an EDI guide?
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/guides/what-is-a-stedi-guide



You and your trading partner must agree on the exact format for each transaction type you plan to exchange. In practice, the larger trading partner typically dictates a format that the other trading partner must follow.

These requirements are defined in what the EDI industry calls an **implementation guide**, also known as a companion guide, EDI reference guide, or just a guide. An implementation guide is similar to a Schema definition, with a few peculiarities specific to EDI.

You need an implementation guide for each transaction type you plan to exchange with your partner. For example, you need an implementation guide for a purchase order and a separate guide for an invoice.

## Validation

Implementation guides include information like expected fields, data types and sizes, and which fields are required. You can use these details to validate incoming and outgoing EDI documents.

## Stedi guides vs. standard guides

Standard EDI implementation guides are typically captured in a static format, like PDF, CSV, or even Word document files. In contrast, Stedi guides display EDI requirements as interactive web pages with built-in validation.

Stedi guides are also machine-readable, so Stedi can use them to read and write EDI documents according to each partner's EDI requirements. This is why we recommend always selecting a guide for each [transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) in your integration.

The [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) contains hundreds of Stedi guides for popular trading partners that you can import into your Stedi account and use in your integration for free.

## Base specifications

All EDI implementation guides are customized versions of a base specification.

There are several EDI standards that provide base specifications. The most common are X12 and EDIFACT. The [EDI Reference](https://www.stedi.com/edi) documentation contains a full list of base specifications for each standard.

* [X12 transaction sets](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12)
* [EDIFACT messages](https://www.stedi.com/edi/edifact)

A base specification is designed by a standard body to cover all possible use cases for a given transaction. For example, the base specification for ship notices contains fields for every type of ship notice you could ever encounter.

Base specifications are far too generic for day-to-day use. Instead, you and your trading partner must agree on what that transaction set should contain and then adjust the base specification accordingly. The result is an implementation guide, which contains only a subset of [segments](https://www.stedi.com/edi/essentials/x12/segments) from the base specification.

Implementation guides can have other differences from the base specification as well. For example, some segments that are optional in the base specification may be marked as mandatory in the implementation guide.

Each trading partner has their own implementation guide for each type of transaction. For example, [Home Depot](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/home-depot/purchase-order/01H66G46HEFTS5NSV52VK41NZ2), [Walmart](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/walmart-edi/purchase-order-acknowledgment/01GNZA51CHFJJD9Y75GSSCXHHW), and [JCPenney](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/jcpenney/purchase-order-acknowledgment/01GV5KNNM3GAZHCEH5ZZ84XKTQ) all have separate implementation guides for the X12 850 Purchase Order.


# Mappings - Transform JSON
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/index



<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

Integrating Stedi with your internal systems requires transforming Stedi [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) to and from a format that your system can understand.

The Stedi Mappings module is a powerful JSON-to-JSON transformation engine. You can build mappings using Stedi’s visual mapper and use mappings to transform data for both inbound and outbound transactions.

For example, the following mapping transforms data from a translated 850 Purchase Order (Guide JSON) to the JSON Schema required for a simple Orders API endpoint.

![Mapping example](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/mappings/mappings-example-full.png)

## When to use Mappings

There are three ways you can transform Stedi transaction data (JSON) into a custom format: Stedi Mappings, writing custom code, and using an iPaaS platform. The approach you choose depends on your circumstances and preferences.

Mappings may be a good fit for your business when:

* Your system can natively produce and consume JSON payloads.
* You plan to do one-step transformations without multi-step processing.
* You want your business or operations team to manage mappings without engineering involvement.
* You want a solution that's integrated with the Stedi platform.

Visit our docs on [Transformation approaches](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/transformation-approaches) for a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of each tranformation method.

### Read EDI

The most common Mappings use case is transforming processed transaction data from Stedi into a custom JSON Schema for your business system.

You can use [webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index) to automatically send transaction processed events to any API endpoint. Then, you can use the [Map Transaction Output](/api-reference/edi-platform/get-map-transaction-output) endpoint to return the mapped output of the processed inbound transaction.

### Write EDI

You can also use Mappings to transform JSON from your business systems into the [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format required to Stedi's API.

### Ingest Stedi events

You may want to transform [Stedi events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types) into a custom shape before sending them to your business system. For example, you may want to ingest `file.failed.v2` events into applications like Slack or Zapier to create internal alerts for your operations team.


# Common Mapping Expressions
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/common-mapping-expressions



<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

For every field in your target, you need to write an expression that specifies how to turn input fields into an output field. The following example shows how you could output a total price from a quantity and a unit price.

```
{ "total": item.quantity * item.unit_price }
```

Refer to [Mapping Definition](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition) for more details about mapping components.

This page demonstrates mapping expressions that address common use cases. Refer to the following resources for more examples.

* [Mapping expression cheatsheet][cheatsheet]: A collection of more common patterns for mapping expressions
* [JSONata documentation][jsonata-docs]: A description of the JSONata language

## Basic mapping expressions

You start with a target field and write a mapping expression to select the corresponding source field. The simplest mapping expression points to a single source field.

**Source**

```json
{
  "telephone": "+(1)(303) 555-0100"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "phone_number": "+(1)(303) 555-0100"
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field   | Mapping expression |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| `phone_number` | `telephone`        |

The output will contain the key `phone_number`. In this case, the mapping expression is simply the name of a field in the source.

### Nested source fields

Use a path to select nested source fields

**Source**

```json
{
  "business": {
    "contact": {
      "telephone": "+(1)(303) 555-0100"
    }
  }
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "phone_number": "+(1)(303) 555-0100"
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field   | Mapping expression           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `phone_number` | `business.contact.telephone` |

A path contains the key names at every level of a field, separated by dots.

It can be tedious to write out the path for every mapping expression, especially if you have a source with a deeply nested structure. In the Mappings UI, you can click on the field in the source to copy the path to your clipboard.

## Lists

To map a list in the source to a list in the target, you need to take two steps.

1. Write a mapping expression to specify which list you need from the source.
2. Write a mapping expression for each field inside the list of your target.

**Source**

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "order": {
      "products": [
        {
          "id": "QL-5490S",
          "amount": 17,
          "price": {
            "unit": 840,
            "total": 14280
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "LV-69200",
          "amount": 91,
          "price": {
            "unit": 15,
            "total": 1365
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "RD-0392P",
          "amount": 1,
          "price": {
            "unit": 930,
            "total": 930
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "product_number": "FF08CD",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unit_price": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expression**

In the target, the list is called `orders`. In the mappings UI, the field is marked with the word **array**, which is another word for list. In the source, the list that contains the relevant data has the path `transaction.order.products`, so that's the mapping expression you need for `orders`.

Specify a mapping expression for each field in `orders`. For example, the field `product_number` is called `id` in the source.

| Target field     | Mapping expression           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `orders`         | `transaction.order.products` |
| `product_number` | `id`                         |
| `quantity`       | `amount`                     |
| `unit_price`     | `price.unit`                 |

The mapping expressions for the fields in the list don't include `transaction.order.products`, because Mappings knows that those fields are relative to the context of the list. For that reason, the mapping expression for a list is referred to as a *list context*.

### List indexes

If the list entries of your target document are expected to include a list index number, you can access it by binding a *positional variable* to the List Context.

<Info>
  Read about *positional variable binding* in the [JSONata
  docs](https://docs.jsonata.org/path-operators#-positional-variable-binding).
</Info>

For example, imagine you have the same source document as in the previous example, but the target document contains a new `index` property:

**Source**

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "order": {
      "products": [
        {
          "id": "QL-5490S",
          "amount": 17,
          "price": {
            "unit": 840,
            "total": 14280
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "LV-69200",
          "amount": 91,
          "price": {
            "unit": 15,
            "total": 1365
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "RD-0392P",
          "amount": 1,
          "price": {
            "unit": 930,
            "total": 930
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "product_number": "FF08CD",
      "index": 1,
      "quantity": 1,
      "unit_price": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expression**

To get access to the list index number, you need to define a *positional variable* for your List Context first. Then, you can use it in your mapping expression for the `index` field. Positional variables in JSONata are zero-based.

| Target field     | Mapping expression                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `orders`         | `transaction.order.products#$myIndex` |
| `product_number` | `id`                                  |
| `index`          | `$myIndex + 1`                        |
| `quantity`       | `amount`                              |
| `unit_price`     | `price.unit`                          |

Once the expression gets evaluated, you can verify that the `index` property is successfully populated for every item in the Output JSON document. This approach could create output like the following example.

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "product_number": "QL-5490S",
      "index": 1,
      "quantity": 17,
      "unit_price": 840
    },
    {
      "product_number": "LV-69200",
      "index": 2,
      "quantity": 91,
      "unit_price": 15
    },
    {
      "product_number": "RD-0392P",
      "index": 3,
      "quantity": 1,
      "unit_price": 930
    }
  ]
}
```

### Lists with one value

If a list contains only one value, it will show up in the output as a single value instead of as a list. Consider the following example.

**Source**

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "QL-5490S"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "product_numbers": ["FF08CD", "RX66PL"]
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field      | Mapping expression |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `product_numbers` | `products.id`      |

You'd expect the output to be a list, just like the target example, but because there's only one product, the result is a single value.

```json
{
  "product_numbers": "QL-5490S"
}
```

If you want to make sure that the result is always an array, put `[]` at the end of the mapping expression. The following example shows the new output.

```json
{
  "product_numbers": ["QL-5490S"]
}
```

## Objects

In a generic case, to map an object in the source to an object in the target, you don't need to do anything on the object level, you only need to define expressions for each field inside of your target object.

**Source**

```json
{
  "product":
    {
      "id": "QL-5490S",
      "amount": 17,
      "price": {
        "unit": 840,
        "total": 14280
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "order": {
    "product_number": "FF08CD",
    "quantity": 1,
    "unit_price": 20
  }
}
```

**Expression**

Specify a mapping expression for each field within the `order` object.

| Target field     | Mapping expression   |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| `order`          |                      |
| `product_number` | `product.id`         |
| `quantity`       | `product.amount`     |
| `unit_price`     | `product.price.unit` |

There is no expression specified on the `order` level, so all of its children have to specify a path relative to the root of the source document.

## Object context

Object context is an optional expression that can be provided for any field which contains a single JSON object.

By providing an object context you can improve your mappings in two ways:

1. Avoid repetition of the data transformation within child field expressions.
2. Omit whole objects from the output based on a condition.

### Avoiding repetition within child field expressions

Another way to solve the same mapping from the previous example, would be to provide an *object context* for the `order`, and remove the common part of the path from expressions of its child fields.

| Target field     | Mapping expression |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `order`          | `product`          |
| `product_number` | `id`               |
| `quantity`       | `amount`           |
| `unit_price`     | `price.unit`       |

Removal of the repeated path prefix was not so dramatic, but imagine you have to map a particular member of an array in the source document, to a single object in the output document.

**Source**

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "QL-5490S",
      "amount": 17,
      "price": {
        "unit": 840,
        "total": 14280
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "LV-69200",
      "amount": 91,
      "price": {
        "unit": 15,
        "total": 1365
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "RD-0392P",
      "amount": 1,
      "price": {
        "unit": 930,
        "total": 930
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "order": {
    "product_number": "FF08CD",
    "quantity": 1,
    "unit_price": 20
  }
}
```

**Expression**

In this example, we are only interested in a product with ID starting with `LV-` prefix.

| Target field     | Mapping expression                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `order`          | `products[$startsWith(id, "LV-")] ~> $single` |
| `product_number` | `id`                                          |
| `quantity`       | `amount`                                      |
| `unit_price`     | `price.unit`                                  |

The mapping expressions for the fields in the list don't include the filter expression, because Mappings knows that those fields are relative to the context of the object. For that reason, the optional mapping expression for an object is referred to as an *object context*.

### Conditionally omitting objects

Mappings allows to skip an object with all of its child fields from the output based on a condition. To achieve that, specify a custom object context that evaluates to an [\$omitField constant](#dollaromitfield) when your desired conditions are met.

Let's consider a case, where the source document may contain an array of products of variable length, and if the count of products in the source is `0`, a certain object should not be populated in the output.

**Source**

```json
{
  "customer": "John Doe",
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "QL-5490S",
      "amount": 17,
      "price": {
        "unit": 840,
        "total": 14280
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "LV-69200",
      "amount": 91,
      "price": {
        "unit": 15,
        "total": 1365
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "RD-0392P",
      "amount": 1,
      "price": {
        "unit": 930,
        "total": 930
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "customer_name": "Jane Doe",
  "order": {
    "quantity": 1,
    "total_price": 20
  }
}
```

**Expression**

To omit the `order` object from the output, you should provide a ternary condition as an optional object context, and return `$omitField` when zero products were found in the source.

When the omitting condition is not met, you can pass down the parent context variable `$`, which in this case would evaluate to the whole source document, the same as not providing and object context at all.

| Target field    | Mapping expression                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `customer_name` | `customer`                              |
| `order`         | `$count(products) = 0 ? $omitField : $` |
| `quantity`      | `$count(products)`                      |
| `total_price`   | `$sum(products.price.total)`            |

## Advanced mapping expressions

Mappings allows you to do more advanced things than selecting fields. Unless you're an experienced programmer, writing complex mapping expressions will take some getting used to. We'll provide some common patterns here. If you're looking for more, check out our [mapping expressions cheatsheet][cheatsheet].

<Tip>
  Advanced mapping expressions can get quite long. Click on the green icon next
  to the mapping expression you're editing to open the fullscreen view. This
  will give you more space to work with.
</Tip>

### Text to number

Sometimes, your source will have quotes around a number. When that happens, Mappings thinks it's dealing with text. You can convert the text to a number by using the `$number` function.

**Source**

```json
{
  "quantity": "8"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "quantity": 8
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression  |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| `quantity`   | `$number(quantity)` |

### Number to text

If your target contains a number in quotes, then to Mappings, that's text instead of a number. You can convert the number to text by using the `$string` function. String is another word for text.

**Source**

```json
{
  "quantity": 8
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "quantity": "8"
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression  |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| `quantity`   | `$string(quantity)` |

### Calculations

You can do calculations on numbers using `*`, `/`, `+`, and `-`.

**Source**

```json
{
  "price": 500,
  "quantity": 8,
  "discount": 150
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "total": 3850
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `total`      | `price * quantity * discount` |

If the numbers in the source are surrounded by quotes, you need to convert them first using the `$number` function.

**Source**

```json
{
  "subtotal": "500",
  "vat": "10"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "total": 510
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `total`      | `$number(subtotal) * $number(vat)` |

### Sum and average

You can calculate the sum and average of a list of numbers using `$sum` and `$average`.

**Source**

```json
{
  "prices": [14280, 1365, 930]
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "sum": 16575,
  "average": 5525
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `sum`        | `sum(prices)`      |
| `average`    | `average(prices)`  |

Often, the numbers you're interested in are part of a more complex structure.

**Source**

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "product_id": "QL-5490S",
      "price": 14280
    },
    {
      "product_id": "LV-69200",
      "price": 1365
    },
    {
      "product_id": "RD-0392P",
      "price": 930
    }
  ]
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "sum": 16575,
  "average": 5525
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression         |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| `sum`        | `$sum(orders[].price)`     |
| `average`    | `$average(orders[].price)` |

In this case, you can refer to the field you're interested in by its full path (`price`). Make sure to put `[]` after the name of the list (`orders`) to let Mappings know that you want all prices in the list.

### Putting text together

When you have to two text fields and you want to put them together, you can use `&`.

**Source**

```json
{
  "first_name": "Alice",
  "last_name": "Mahara"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "name": "Alice Mahara"
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `name`       | `first_name & " " & last_name` |

### Taking text apart

You can extract a small part out of a text by using `$substring`. You need to specify where the part is that you're interested in, so this only works for text that follows a predictable pattern.

**Source**

```json
{
  "phone_number": "(303) 555-0100"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "area_code": "303"
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `area_code`  | `substring(phone_number, 1, 3)` |

The two numbers let `$substring` know where the part begins, and how many letters you want. `$substring` starts counting characters at 0, so in the example above, we start at the second characters.

If the part you're interested in is at the back of the text, you can use a negative number to tell `$substring` to start counting from the last character.

**Source**

```json
{
  "phone_number": "(303) 555-0100"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "local_number": "555-0100"
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field   | Mapping expression                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `local_number` | `$substring(phone_number, -8. 8)` |

### Splitting text

Sometimes a text contains multiple pieces of data, separated by a character. You can turn the text into a list using `$split`.

**Source**

```json
{
  "location": "Chicago, Illinois, United States"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "location": ["Chicago", "Illinois", "United States"]
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression       |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| `location`   | `$split(location, ", ")` |

You can assign each item in the list to a field by using an *index*, which is a number between square brackets. Items in a list are numbered starting at 0.

**Source**

```json
{
  "location": "Chicago, Illinois, United States"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "city": "Chicago",
  "state": "Illinois",
  "country": "United States"
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression          |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| `city`       | `$split(location, ", ")[0]` |
| `state`      | `$split(location, ", ")[1]` |
| `country`    | `$split(location, ", ")[2]` |

### Lookup table

If you have a field that contains a code that you want to replace with a related value, you can build a lookup table.

**Source**

```json
{
  "country_code": "USA"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "country": "United States"
}
```

Before you can write a mapping expression for this, you'll need to create the lookup table.

1. Clicking the edit icon next to the mapping expression.
2. Click **Lookup tables** and select **Add new**.
3. Enter values for your table. You can add values manually, or load them from CSV.

Now you can use the lookup table in your mapping expressions using the function `$lookupTable`. For example, you might create a lookup table for country codes and then write the following expression.

| Target field   | Mapping expression                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `country_code` | `$lookupTable($tables.countries, "short" country_code).long` |

A lookup table isn't limited to two values per entry; a row can have as many values as you need. For example, you could create a currency lookup table with two columns: `code` for the country code and `symbol` for the currency symbol.

**Source**

```json
{
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

**Target**

```json
{
  "currency": {
    "name": "U.S. Dollar",
    "symbol": "$"
  }
}
```

**Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | `$lookupTable($tables.currency, "code", currency).name`   |
| `symbol`     | `$lookupTable($tables.currency, "code", currency).symbol` |

### Lookup table wildcards

You can use Lookup Tables and wildcards for matching multiple possible input options at once.

In your lookup table, replace the interchangeable part of the key you want to match against with the `*` symbol (or any other sequence of symbols, you will be able to select what to match against during the `$lookupTable` function call).

-> **Note:** You can replace multiple parts of your key with `*`.

Any input value that matches the loosely defined wildcard-based lookup table value is now matched when the `{ "wildcard": "*" }` is passed as an optional parameter to the `$lookupTable` function.

## Mapping types

The mapping type specifies how the Mappings API generates the output field when the mapping expression doesn't produce a value. A mapping expression may not produce a value when one or more of the input fields that the mapping expression depends on aren't present.

You can choose between the following mapping types:

* Only mapped keys
* Merge with target example
* Pass through

Visit [Mapping Definition Overview](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition#mapping-types) for full details and examples of how the Mappings UI generates outputs in each case.

## Omitting output fields

There are times when a field is present in the target, but you don't want it to end up in the output. You have two options.

* Deselect the target field.
* Use the `$omitField` constant.

### Deselecting target fields

If you don't provide a mapping expression for a target field, or if a mapping expression doesn't produce a result, the field may still end up in the output. If you don't want that, you can deselect the target field.

In the following example, none of the fields in the `totals` object has a mapping expression associated with it, but it still ends up in the output.

**Target**

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "FF08CD"
    }
  ],
  "totals": {
    "quantity": 3,
    "price": 8850
  }
}
```

| Target field | Mapping expression |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `products`   | `products`         |
| `id`         | `id`               |
| `quantity`   |                    |
| `price`      |                    |

**Output**

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "QL-5490S"
    }
  ],
  "totals": {}
}
```

If you don't want `totals` to show up at all, select **Target keys** and deselect the field.

This doesn't apply when you set the mapping type to *Merge with target example*, because that option will always copy the values from the the target, unless you use `$omitField`.

### \$omitField

Whether a target field should end up in the output is not always a simple yes-or-no question. Sometimes, it depends on the result of the mapping expression. In that case you can use `$omitField` to tell Mappings when to skip the field.

This is particularly useful if the mapping type is set to *Merge with target example* and you don't want to use the default value. In the following example, the total price is included only if the amount of products is larger than 0.

**Target**

```json
{
  "totalPrice": 3000,
  "unitPrice": 150
}
```

**Mapping Expression**

| Target field | Mapping expression                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `totalPrice` | `amount > 0 ? amount * price : $omitField` |
| `unitPrice`  | `price`                                    |

**Input**

```json
{
  "price": 150,
  "amount": 0
}
```

**Output**

```json
{
  "unitPrice": 150
}
```

Without `$omitField`, the output would've included the `totalPrice` with its default value of `3000`, which is clearly wrong in this case.

<Tip>
  You can use `$omitField` in any input field on the Mapping form, including
  [list context](#lists) and [object context](#object-context) inputs.

  financial calculations. Floating-point arithmetic can introduce rounding
  errors, which can accumulate and lead to incorrect results. Visit our [JSONata
  Playground](https://stedi.link/UKXfsxe) for an example. We recommend
  representing monetary values as integers (e.g. cents) and performing
  calculations on those integers.

### 1.7 Variables

In JSONata, any name that starts with a `$` is a variable (e.g. `$streetName := address.street`). A variable can be one of any type in JSONata's [type system](https://docs.jsonata.org/processing#the-jsonata-type-system).

#### Built-in variables

* `$` – the variable with no name refers to the context value at any point in the input JSON hierarchy.
* `$$` – the root of the input JSON. You can use it to break out of the current context and navigate down a different path.

#### Convert a list of fields to the desired format using the built-in `$` variable

#### Positional variables

[Positional variables binding](https://docs.jsonata.org/path-operators#-positional-variable-binding) can be used to determine at which position in the sequence the current context item is. It can be used following any map, filter or order-by stage in the path.

The variable is available for use within subsequent stages of the path (e.g. within filter predicates or a map operation) and goes out of scope at the end of the path expression.

#### Populate order title based on its index within the orders array

# Array functions
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-functions/array



## \$count

**Signature:** `$count(array)`

**Parameters:**

* `array` - An array to process.

If the `array` parameter is not an array, but rather a value of another JSON type, then the parameter is treated as a singleton array containing that value, and this function returns `1`.

Returns the number of items in the `array` parameter. If the `array` parameter is not an array, but rather a value of another JSON type, then the parameter is treated as a singleton array containing that value, and this function returns `1`.

If `array` is not specified, then the context value is used as the value of array.

**Examples**

| Expression          | Result |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| `$count([1,2,3,1])` | `4`    |
| `$count("hello")`   | `1`    |

## \$append

**Signature:** `$append(array1, array2)`

**Parameters:**

* `array1` - The first array to append the second argument to.

If this parameter is not an array, then it is treated as a singleton array containing that value.

* `array2` - The second array to append to the first argument.

If this parameter is not an array, then it is treated as a singleton array containing that value.

Returns an array containing the values in `array1` followed by the values in `array2`. If either parameter is not an array, then it is treated as a singleton array containing that value.

**Examples**

| Expression                  | Result               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `$append([1,2,3], [4,5,6])` | `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`      |
| `$append([1,2,3], 4)`       | `[1,2,3,4]`          |
| `$append("Hello", "World")` | `["Hello", "World"]` |

## \$sort

**Signature:** `$sort(array, [, function])`

**Parameters:**

* `array` - An array to sort.
* `function` - If a comparator `function` is supplied, then is must be a function that takes two parameters:

`function(left, right)`

This function gets invoked by the sorting algorithm to compare two values `left` and `right`. If the value of left should be placed after the value of `right` in the desired sort order, then the function must return Boolean `true` to indicate a swap. Otherwise it must return `false`.

Returns an array containing all the values in the `array` parameter, but sorted into order. If no `function` parameter is supplied, then the `array` parameter must contain only numbers or only strings, and they will be sorted in order of increasing number, or increasing unicode codepoint respectively.

If a comparator `function` is supplied, then is must be a function that takes two parameters:

`function(left, right)`

This function gets invoked by the sorting algorithm to compare two values `left` and `right`. If the value of left should be placed after the value of `right` in the desired sort order, then the function must return Boolean `true` to indicate a swap. Otherwise it must return `false`.

**Example**

```
$sort(Account.Order.Product, function($l, $r) {
  $l.Description.Weight > $r.Description.Weight
})
```

This sorts the products in order of increasing weight.

The sorting algorithm is stable which means that values within the original array which are the same according to the comparator function will remain in the original order in the sorted array.

## \$reverse

**Signature:** `$reverse(array)`

**Parameters:**

* `array` - An array to reverse.

Returns an array containing all the values from the `array` parameter, but in reverse order.

**Examples**

| Expression                     | Result               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `$reverse(["Hello", "World"])` | `["World", "Hello"]` |

## \$shuffle

**Signature:** `$shuffle(array)`

**Parameters:**

* `array` - An array to shuffle.

Returns an array containing all the values from the `array` parameter, but shuffled into random order.

**Examples**

| Expression         | Result                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `$shuffle([1..9])` | `[6, 8, 2, 3, 9, 5, 1, 4, 7]` |

## \$distinct

**Signature:** `$distinct(array)`

**Parameters:**

* `array` - An array to process.

Returns an array containing all the values from the `array` parameter, but with any duplicates removed. Values are tested for deep equality as if by using the [equality operator](https://docs.jsonata.org/comparison-operators#equals).

**Examples**

| Expression                                            | Result                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `$distinct([1,2,3,3,4,3,5])`                          | `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`               |
| `$distinct(Account.Order.Product.Description.Colour)` | `["Purple", "Orange", "Black"]` |

## \$zip

**Signature:** `$zip(array1, ...)`

**Parameters:**

* `array1` - An array to zip.

Returns a convolved (zipped) array containing grouped arrays of values from the `array1` ... `arrayN` arguments from index 0, 1, 2, etc.

This function accepts a variable number of arguments. The length of the returned array is equal to the length of the shortest array in the arguments.

**Examples**

| Expression                    | Result                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `$zip([1,2,3], [4,5,6])`      | `[[1,4] ,[2,5], [3,6]]` |
| `$zip([1,2,3],[4,5],[7,8,9])` | `[[1,4,7], [2,5,8]]`    |

# Date/time functions
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-functions/date-time



## \$now

**Signature:** `$now([picture [, timezone]])`

**Parameters:**

* `picture` - If the optional `picture` string is supplied, then the timestamp is formatted occording to the representation specified in that string.

The behaviour of this function is consistent with the two-argument version of the XPath/XQuery function [fn:format-dateTime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-format-dateTime) as defined in the XPath F\&O 3.1 specification. The picture string parameter defines how the timestamp is formatted and has the [same syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#date-picture-string) as fn:format-dateTime.

* `timezone` - If the optional `timezone` string is supplied, then the formatted timestamp will be in that timezone.

The `timezone` string should be in the format "±HHMM", where ± is either the plus or minus sign and HHMM is the offset in hours and minutes from UTC. Positive offset for timezones east of UTC, negative offset for timezones west of UTC.

Generates a UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 compatible format and returns it as a string. All invocations of `$now()` within an evaluation of an expression will all return the same timestamp value.

If the optional `picture` and `timezone` parameters are supplied, then the current timestamp is formatted as described by the [`$fromMillis()`](/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-functions/date-time#frommillis) function.

**Examples**

| Expression | Result                       |

## \$toMillis

**Signature:** `$toMillis(timestamp [, picture])`

**Parameters:**

* `timestamp` - A formatted timestamp string.

If the optional `picture` string is not specified, then the format of the timestamp is assumed to be [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html). An error is thrown if the string is not in the correct format.

* `picture` - If the `picture` string is specified, then the format is assumed to be described by this picture string using the [same syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#date-picture-string) as the XPath/XQuery function [fn:format-dateTime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-format-dateTime), defined in the XPath F\&O 3.1 specification.

Convert a `timestamp` string to the number of milliseconds since the Unix *Epoch* (1 January, 1970 UTC) as a number. This function is provided by Stedi and isn't a part of the JSONata standard library.

If the optional `picture` string is not specified, then the format of the timestamp is assumed to be [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html). An error is thrown if the string is not in the correct format.

If the `picture` string is specified, then the format is assumed to be described by this picture string using the [same syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#date-picture-string) as the XPath/XQuery function [fn:format-dateTime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/#func-format-dateTime), defined in the XPath F\&O 3.1 specification.

**Examples**

| Expression                              | Result          |

## \$convertDateTime

**Signature:** `$convertDateTime(str, sourceFormat, targetFormat [, sourceTimezone [, targetTimezone]])`

**Parameters:**

* `str` - An input string with date to be formatted
* `sourceFormat` - Date format of the input string using [using unicode tokens](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table)
* `targetFormat` - Format of the output string using [using unicode tokens](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table)
* `sourceTimezone` - Specifies source date's timezone if the date is in format without the zone offset e.g.: +01:00 or Z
* `targetTimezone` - If specified, function will also convert date's timezone to the targeted one.

Parses the `str` according to the `sourceFormat` and returns a formatted string according to `targetFormat`.
If `targetTimezone` is specified, function will also convert date's timezone to desired one. If `str` is in format without timezone defined, please use `sourceTimezone` to specify its timezone. Without it being specified, function will assume UTC timezone. If both `str` and `sourceTimezone` will be specified, zone offset in `str` will take a precedence over `sourceTimezone`.
Both formats must be specified [using unicode tokens](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).
This function is provided by Stedi and isn't a part of the JSONata standard library.

Note there are 4 tokens that might cause confusion:

* `D` and `DD` that represent the day of a year (1, 2, ..., 365, 366) are often confused with `d` and `dd` that represent the day of a month (1, 2, ..., 31).
* `y` and `yyyy` that represent the local week-numbering year (44, 01, 00, 17) are often confused with `yy` and `yyyy` that represent the calendar year.

`function(value [, index [, array]])`

Each value in the input array is passed in as the first parameter in the supplied function. The index (position) of that value in the input array is passed in as the second parameter, if specified. The whole input array is passed in as the third parameter, if specified.

**Example** The following expression returns all the products whose price is higher than average:

```
$filter(Account.Order.Product, function($v, $i, $a) {
  $v.Price > $average($a.Price)
})
```

## \$single

**Signature:** `$single(array, function)`

**Parameters:**

* `array` - An array to search in.
* `function` - The function that is supplied as the second parameter must have the following signature:

`function(value [, index [, array]])`

Each value in the input array is passed in as the first parameter in the supplied function. The index (position) of that value in the input array is passed in as the second parameter, if specified. The whole input array is passed in as the third parameter, if specified.

Returns the one and only one value in the `array` parameter that satisfy the `function` predicate (i.e. `function` returns Boolean `true` when passed the value). Throws an exception if the number of matching values is not exactly one.

The function that is supplied as the second parameter must have the following signature:

`function(value [, index [, array]])`

Each value in the input array is passed in as the first parameter in the supplied function. The index (position) of that value in the input array is passed in as the second parameter, if specified. The whole input array is passed in as the third parameter, if specified.

**Example** The following expression the product in the order whose SKU is `"0406654608"`:

```
$single(Account.Order.Product, function($v, $i, $a) {
  $v.SKU = "0406654608"
})
```

## \$reduce

**Signature:** `$reduce(array, function [, init])`

**Parameters:**

* `array` - An array to reduce.
* `function` - The `function` must accept at least two arguments, and behaves like an infix operator between each value within the `array`. The signature of this supplied function must be of the form:

`function(accumulator, value[, index[, array]])`

Returns an aggregated value derived from applying the `function` parameter successively to each value in `array` in combination with the result of the previous application of the function.

The `function` must accept at least two arguments, and behaves like an infix operator between each value within the `array`. The signature of this supplied function must be of the form:

`myfunc($accumulator, $value[, $index[, $array]])`

**Example**

```
(
  $product := function($i, $j){$i * $j};
  $reduce([1..5], $product)
)
```

This multiplies all the values together in the array `[1..5]` to return `120`.

If the optional `init` parameter is supplied, then that value is used as the initial value in the aggregation (fold) process. If not supplied, the initial value is the first value in the `array` parameter.

## \$sift

**Signature:** `$sift(object, function)`

**Parameters:**

* `object` - An object to process.
* `function` - The `function` that is supplied as the second parameter must have the following signature:

`function(value [, key [, object]])`

Each value in the input object is passed in as the first parameter in the supplied function. The key (property name) of that value in the input object is passed in as the second parameter, if specified. The whole input object is passed in as the third parameter, if specified.

Returns an object that contains only the key/value pairs from the `object` parameter that satisfy the predicate `function` passed in as the second parameter.

If `object` is not specified, then the context value is used as the value of `object`. It is an error if `object` is not an object.

The function that is supplied as the second parameter must have the following signature:

`function(value [, key [, object]])`

Each value in the input object is passed in as the first parameter in the supplied function. The key (property name) of that value in the input object is passed in as the second parameter, if specified. The whole input object is passed in as the third parameter, if specified.

**Example**

```
Account.Order.Product.$sift(function($v, $k) {$k ~> /^Product/})
```

This sifts each of the Product objects such that they only contain the fields whose keys start with the string "Product" (using a regex). This example returns:

```
[
  {
    "Product Name": "Bowler Hat",
    "ProductID": 858383
  },
  {
    "Product Name": "Trilby hat",
    "ProductID": 858236
  },
  {
    "Product Name": "Bowler Hat",
    "ProductID": 858383
  },
  {
    "ProductID": 345664,
    "Product Name": "Cloak"
  }
]

# Numeric functions
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-functions/numeric



<Warning>
  It is not recommended to use JSONata for floating point arithmetic, such as
  financial calculations. Floating-point arithmetic can introduce rounding
  errors, which can accumulate and lead to incorrect results. Visit our [JSONata
  Playground](https://stedi.link/UKXfsxe) for an example. We recommend
  representing monetary values as integers (e.g. cents) and performing
  calculations on those integers.
</Warning>

## \$number

**Signature:** `$number(arg)`

**Parameters:**

* `arg` - An argument to be cast to number.

Casts the `arg` parameter to a number using the following casting rules

* Numbers are unchanged
* Strings that contain a sequence of characters that represent a legal JSON number are converted to that number
* Hexadecimal numbers start with `0x`, Octal numbers with `0o`, binary numbers with `0b`
* Boolean `true` casts to `1`, Boolean `false` casts to `0`

If `arg` is not specified (i.e. this function is invoked with no arguments), then the context value is used as the value of `arg`.

**Examples**

| Expression                            | Result            |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `$number("5")`                        | `5`               |
| `$number("0x12")`                     | `0x18`            |

If `precision` is not specified then it defaults to the value `0` and the number is rounded to the nearest integer.
If `precision` is negative, then its value specifies which column to round to on the left side of the decimal place

Returns the value of the `number` parameter rounded to the number of decimal places specified by the optional `precision` parameter.

The `precision` parameter (which must be an integer) species the number of decimal places to be present in the rounded number. If `precision` is not specified then it defaults to the value `0` and the number is rounded to the nearest integer. If `precision` is negative, then its value specifies which column to round to on the left side of the decimal place

This function uses the [Round half to even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even) strategy to decide which way to round numbers that fall exactly between two candidates at the specified precision. This strategy is commonly used in financial calculations and is the default rounding mode in IEEE 754.

An error is thrown if the values of `base` and `exponent` lead to a value that cannot be represented as a JSON number (e.g. Infinity, complex numbers).

**Examples**

| Expression       | Result           |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `$power(2, 8)`   | `256`            |

# Boolean Operators
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-operators/boolean



## `and` (Boolean AND)

The 'and' operator returns Boolean `true` if both operands evaluate to `true`. If either or both operands is not a Boolean type, then they are first cast to a Boolean using the rules of the `$boolean` function.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="420" src="https://stedi.link/1vPjc9k?sourcePanelHeight=220&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `or` (Boolean OR)

The 'or' operator returns Boolean `true` if either operand evaluates to `true`. If either or both operands is not a Boolean type, then they are first cast to a Boolean using the rules of the `$boolean` function.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboarnd-write" width="100%" height="420" src="https://stedi.link/iSHVzHN?sourcePanelHeight=220&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

**Please note that Boolean 'NOT' is a [function](/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-functions/boolean#not), not an operator.**


# Comparison Operators
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-operators/comparison



## `=` (Equals)

The equality operator returns Boolean `true` if both operands are the same (type and value). Arrays and objects are checked for deep equality. Arrays must have the same values in the same order. Objects must have the same key/value pairs (order is not relevant). Otherwise it returns `false`.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/FWzqg9d?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `!=` (Not equals)

The inequality operator returns Boolean `false` if both operands are the same (type and value, deep equality). Otherwise it returns `true`.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/GvzdSMx?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `>` (Greater than)

The 'greater than' operator returns Boolean `true` if the LHS is numerically greater than the RHS. Otherwise it returns `false`.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/npUNfaa?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `<` (Less than)

The 'less than' operator returns Boolean `true` if the LHS is numerically less than the RHS. Otherwise it returns `false`.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/DYHOhQ7?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `>=` (Greater than or equals)

The 'greater than or equals' operator returns Boolean `true` if the LHS is numerically greater than or equal to the RHS. Otherwise it returns `false`.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/tgNWiMy?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `<=` (Less than or equals)

The 'less than or equals' operator returns Boolean `true` if the LHS is numerically less than or equal to the RHS. Otherwise it returns `false`.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/O4VieKY?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `in` (Inclusion)

The array (sequence) inclusion operator returns Boolean `true` if the value of the LHS is included in the array of values on the RHS. Otherwise it returns `false`. If the RHS is a single value, then it is treated as a singleton array.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/36ezOvX?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

# Numeric Operators
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-operators/numeric



## `+` (Addition)

The addition operator adds the operands to produce the numerical sum. It is an error if either operand is not a number.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/WxDGc66?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `-` (Substraction/Negation)

The subtraction operator subtracts the RHS value from the LHS value to produce the numerical difference It is an error if either operand is not a number.

It can also be used in its unary form to negate a number

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/6m3jxGL?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `*` (Multiplication)

The multiplication operator multiplies the operands to produce the numerical product. It is an error if either operand is not a number.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/icwp9TZ?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `/` (Division)

The division operator divides the RHS into the LHS to produce the numerical quotient. It is an error if either operand is not a number.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/kcoT4OG?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `%` (Modulo)

The modulo operator divides the RHS into the LHS using whole number division to produce a whole number quotient and a remainder. This operator returns the remainder. It is an error if either operand is not a number.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/LY8srBW?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `..` (Range)

The sequence generation operator is used to create an array of monotonically increasing integer start with the number on the LHS and ending with the number on the RHS. It is an error if either operand does not evaluate to an integer. The sequence generator can only be used within an array constructor \[].

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/2j0QLeb?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />


# Other Operators
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-operators/other



## `&` (Concatenation)

The string concatenation operator is used to join the string values of the operands into a single resultant string. If either or both of the operands are not strings, then they are first cast to string using the rules of the `$string` function.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/E5h8Zw4?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `? :` (Conditional)

The conditional ternary operator is used to evaluate one of two alternative expressions based on the result of a predicate (test) condition. The operator takes the form:

`<test_expr> ? <expr_T> : <expr_F>`

The `<test_expr>` expression is first evaluated. If it evaluates to Boolean `true`, then the operator returns the result of evaluating the `<expr_T>` expression. Otherwise it returns the result of evaluating the `<expr_F>` expression. If `<test_expr>` evaluates to a non-Boolean value, then the value is first cast to Boolean using the rules of the `$boolean` function.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="420" src="https://stedi.link/JYzJ03X?sourcePanelHeight=220&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `:=` (Variable binding)

The variable binding operator is used to bind the value of the RHS to the variable name defined on the LHS. The variable binding is scoped to the current block and any nested blocks. It is an error if the LHS is not a `$` followed by a valid variable name.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/ybeVywG?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `~>` (Chain)

The function chaining operator is used in the situations where multiple nested functions need to be applied to a value, while making it easy to read. The value on the LHS is evaluated, then passed into the function on the RHS as its first argument. If the function has any other arguments, then these are passed to the function in parenthesis as usual. It is an error if the RHS is not a function, or an expression that evaluates to a function.

**Examples**

`$uppercase($substringBefore($substringAfter(Customer.Email, "@"), "."))`

and

`$sum(Account.Order.Product.(Price * Quantity))`

can be more clearly written:

`Customer.Email ~> $substringAfter("@") ~> $substringBefore(".") ~> $uppercase()`

and

`Account.Order.Product.(Price * Quantity) ~> $sum()`

This operator can also be used in a more abstract form to define new functions based on a combination of existing functions. In this form, there is no value passed in on the LHS of the first function in the chain.

For example

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="200" src="https://stedi.link/azGuUm1?sourcePanelHeight=0&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=100&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

creates a new function `$uppertrim` that performs `$trim` followed by `$uppercase`.

## `... ~> | ... | ... |` (Transform)

The object transform operator is used to modify a copy of an object structure using a pattern/action syntax to target specific modifications while keeping the rest of the structure unchanged.

The syntax has the following structure:

`head ~> | location | update [, delete] |`

where

* `head` evaluates to the object that is to be copied and transformed
* `location` evaluates to the part(s) within the copied object that are to be updated. The `location` expression is evaluated relative to the result of `head`. The result of evaluating `location` must be an object or array of objects.
* `update` evaluates to an object that is merged into the object matched by each `location`. `update` is evaluated relative to the result of `location` and if `location` matched multiple objects, then the update gets evaluated for each one of these. The result of (each) update is merged into the result of `location`.
* `delete` (optional) evaluates to a string or an array of strings. Each string is the name of the name/value pair in each object matched by `location` that is to be removed from the resultant object.

The `~>` operator is the operator for function chaining and passes the value on the left hand side to the function on the right hand side as its first argument. The expression on the right hand side must evaluate to a function, hence the `|...|...|` syntax generates a function with one argument.

Example:

`| Account.Order.Product | {'Price': Price * 1.2} |`

defines a transform that will return a deep copy the object passed to it, but with the `Product` object modified such that its `Price` property has had its value increased by 20%. The first part of the expression is the path location that specifies all of the objects within the overall object to change, and the second part defines an object that will get merged into the object(s) matched by the first part. The merging semantics is the same as that of the `$merge()` function.

This transform definition syntax creates a JSONata function which you can either assign to a variable and use multiple times, or invoke inline.
Example:

`payload ~> |Account.Order.Product|{'Price': Price * 1.2}|`

or:

`$increasePrice := |Account.Order.Product|{'Price': Price * 1.2}|`

This also has the benefit that multiple transforms can be chained together for more complex transformations.

In common with `$merge()`, multiple changes (inserts or updates) can be made to an object.
Example:

`|Account.Order.Product|{'Price': Price * 1.2, 'Total': Price * Quantity}|`

Note that the Total will be calculated using the original price, not the modified one (JSONata is declarative not imperative).

Properties can also be removed from objects. This is done using the optional `delete` clause which specifies the name(s) of the properties to delete.
Example:

`$ ~> |Account.Order.Product|{'Total': Price * Quantity}, ['Price', 'Quantity']|`

This copies the input, but for each `Product` it inserts a Total and removes the `Price` and `Quantity` properties.


# Path Operators
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/jsonata-operators/path



The path operators underpin the declarative nature of the map/filter/reduce processing model in JSONata.

## `.` (Map)

The dot operator is one of the fundamental building blocks in JSONata expressions. It implements the 'for each' or 'map' function that is common in many functional languages.

The dot operator performs the following logic:

* The expression on the LHS is evaluated to produce an array of values.
  * If it evaluates to a single value, that is treated as equivalent to an array containing that single value
  * If it evaluates to nothing (no match or empty array), then the result of the operator expression is nothing
* For each value in the LHS array in turn:
  * The value is known as the *context* and is used as the basis for any relative path expression on the RHS. It is also accessible in the RHS expression using the `$` symbol.
  * The RHS expression is evaluated to produce a value or array of values (or nothing). These values are appended to a combined array of results for the operator as a whole.
* The combined result of the operator is returned.

This operator is left associative meaning that the expression `a.b.c.d` is evaluated like `((a.b).c).d`; i.e. left to right

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="420" src="https://stedi.link/iU4uC8G?sourcePanelHeight=170&expressionPanelHeight=80&outputPanelHeight=170&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `[` ... `]` (Filter)

The filter operator (a.k.a predicate) is used to select only the items in the input sequence that satisfy the predicate expression contained between the square brackets.

If the predicate expression is an integer, or an expression that evaluates to an integer, then the item at that position (zero offset) in the input sequence is the only item selected for the result sequence.
If the number is non-integer, then it is rounded *down* to the nearest integer.

If the predicate expression is an array of integers, or an expression that evaluates to an array of integers, then the items at those positions (zero offset) in the input sequence is the only item selected for the result sequence.

If the predicate expression evaluates to any other value, then it is cast to a Boolean as if using the `$boolean()` function. If this evaluates to `true`, then the item is retained in the result sequence. Otherwise it is rejected.

See [Navigating JSON Arrays](https://docs.jsonata.org/simple#navigating-json-arrays) and [Predicates](https://docs.jsonata.org/predicate) for more details and examples.

## `^(` ... `)` (Order-by)

The order-by operator is used to sort an array of values into ascending or descending order according to one or more expressions defined within the parentheses.

By default, the array will be sorted into ascending order. For example:

`Account.Order.Product^(Price)`

sorts all of the products into order of increasing price (`Price` is a numeric field in the `Product` object).

To sort in descending order, the sort expression must be preceded by the `>` symbol. For example:

`Account.Order.Product^(>Price)`

sorts all of the products into order of decreasing price. The `<` symbol can be used to explicitly indicate ascending order, although that is the default behaviour.

Secondary (and more) sort expressions can be specified by separating them with commas (`,`). The secondary expression will be used to determine order if the primary expression ranks two values the same. For example,

`Account.Order.Product^(>Price, <Quantity)`

orders the products primarily by decreasing price, but for products of the same price, by increasing quantity.

The sort expression(s) can be any valid JSONata expression that evaluates to a number or a string. If it evaluates to a string then the array is sorted in order of unicode codepoint.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="420" src="https://stedi.link/bmcpEEB?sourcePanelHeight=170&expressionPanelHeight=80&outputPanelHeight=170&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

## `{` ... `}` (Reduce)

The reduce operator can be used as the last step in a path expression to group and aggregate its input sequence into a single object.
The key/value pairs between the curly braces determine the groupings (by evaluating the key expression) and the aggregated values for each group.
See [Grouping and Aggregation](https://docs.jsonata.org/sorting-grouping#grouping) for more details.

## `*` (Wildcard)

This wildcard selects the values of all the properties of the context object. It can be used in a path expression in place of a property name, but it cannot be combined with other characters like a glob pattern. The order of these values in the result sequence is implementation dependent.
See [Wildcards](https://docs.jsonata.org/predicate#wildcards) for examples.

## `**` (Descendants)

This wildcard recursively selects the values of all the properties of the context object, and the properties of any objects contained within these values as it descends the hierarchy.
See [Navigate arbitrary depths](https://docs.jsonata.org/predicate#navigate-arbitrary-depths).

## `%` (Parent)

This will select the 'parent' of the current context value. Here, we define 'parent' to be the enclosing object which has the property representing the context value.

This is the only operation which searches 'backwards' in the input data structure. It is implemented by static analysis of the expression at [compile time](https://docs.jsonata.org/embedding-extending#jsonatastr) and can only be used within expressions that navigate through that target parent value in the first place.
If, for any reason, the parent location cannot be determined, then a static error (S0217) is thrown.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="540" src="https://stedi.link/hpg93F6?sourcePanelHeight=220&expressionPanelHeight=100&outputPanelHeight=220&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

This returns an array of objects for each product in each order in each account. Information from the enclosing Order and Account objects can be accessed using the parent operator.
The repeated combination of `%.%.` is used to access the grandparent and higher ancestors.

## `#` (Positional variable binding)

This can be used to determine at which position in the sequence the current context item is. It can be used following any map, filter or order-by stage in the path.
The variable is available for use within subsequent stages of the path (e.g. within filter predicates) and goes out of scope at the end of the path expression.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="450" src="https://stedi.link/UT0sox6?sourcePanelHeight=160&expressionPanelHeight=130&outputPanelHeight=160&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

This returns an array of objects for each book in the library where Kernighan is one of the authors. Each object contains the book's title and its position within the books array before it was filtered.

## `@` (Context variable binding)

This is used to bind the current context item (`$`) to a named variable. It can only be used directly following a map stage, not a filter or order-by stage.
The variable binding remains in scope for the remainder of the path expression.

Because the current context has now been explicitly bound to a named variable, this context will be carried forward to be the context of the next stage in the path.
For example, in this snippet of a path, `library.loans@$l.books`, the loans array is a property of the library object and each loan will, in turn, be bound to the variable `$l`.
The books array, which is also a property of the library object, will then be selected.

This operator can be used to perform data joins within a path because of its ability to do cross-referencing across objects.

**Example**

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="450" src="https://stedi.link/f07gBTe?sourcePanelHeight=160&expressionPanelHeight=130&outputPanelHeight=160&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

This performs an 'inner join' between objects in the loans array and objects in the books array where the ISBNs match between the structures.

Block expressions can be used to widen the scope of the data cross-referencing as shown in this example:

<iframe loading="lazy" allow="clipboard-write https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground/embed" width="100%" height="450" src="https://stedi.link/vVtmzU2?sourcePanelHeight=160&expressionPanelHeight=130&outputPanelHeight=160&lazy=true" title="Stedi JSONata Playground" frameBorder="0" />

# Manage mapping definitions with the API
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/api-guide



<Note>
  Please [contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) if you need access to this
  feature.
</Note>

This page explains how to use the Mappings API to create, read, update, and delete Stedi mapping definitions. You can also do these actions in the [Mappings UI](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/ui-guide).

Before you begin, we recommend reviewing the [Mapping Definition Overview](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition).

## Create a mapping definition

You create a mapping definition by POSTing to `https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings`. At the very least, your mapping definition should have a name, mapping type, and a few mapping expressions.

```http
POST https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings HTTP/1.1
"Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "A minimal example",
  "type": "only_mapped_keys",
  "mapping": "{ \"total\": item.quantity * item.unit_price }"
}
```

The mapping expressions look like JSON, but they're not. JSONata has all kinds of syntax that isn't valid JSON. That's why you need to provide the mapping expressions inside of a string.

### Include a target example

If you want to use the mapping type *Merge with target example*, then you need to provide a target example. You do this by including a target schema that contains the target example. The following mapping definition provides a default value of `0` for the output field `total`.

```http
POST https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings HTTP/1.1
"Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "A target example example",
  "type": "merge_with_target_example",
  "mapping": "{ \"total\": item.quantity * item.unit_price }",
  "target": {
    "name": "target.json",
    "type": "jsonschema@2020-12",
    "content": "{\"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\", \"default\": {\"total\": 0 }}"
  }
}
```

The target schema needs to be passed inside a string. That makes the above example a bit hard to read, so here's the target schema with more sane formatting.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "default": {
    "total": 0
  }
}
```

### Include a lookup table

You can add one or more lookup tables by providing the `lookup_tables` field. Every lookup table must have a name and a set of values.

```http
POST https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings HTTP/1.1
"Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "A lookup table example",
  "type": "only_mapped_keys",
  "mapping": "{ \"country\": $lookupTable($tables.countries, \"german\", land).english }",
  "lookup_tables": [
    {
      "name": "countries",
      "values": [
        {
          "english": "United States",
          "spanish": "Estados Unidos",
          "german": "Vereinigte Staaten"
        },
        {
          "english": "Mexico",
          "spanish": "México",
          "german": "Mexiko"
        },
        {
          "english": "Germany",
          "spanish": "Alemania",
          "german": "Deutschland"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response

The response contains a copy of the mapping definition you just created, plus a couple of extra fields.

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`         | The unique identifier for your mapping definition. You need this if you ever want to update, delete, or use your mapping definition.                   |
| `created_at` | A timestamp indicating when you created this mapping definition.                                                                                       |
| `updated_at` | A timestamp indicating when you last updated this mapping definition. If you've never updated the mapping definition, this is the same as created\_at. |

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "01AB3DEF4GHIJ5KL67MNOP8QR9",
  "name": "A minimal example",
  "type": "only_mapped_keys",
  "mapping": "{ \"total\": item.quantity * item.unit_price }"
  "created_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z"
}
```

## Retrieve a mapping definition

You retrieve a mapping definition by GETting it from `https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings/mapping_id`. The response is identical to the one you received when you created the mapping definition. In other words, it's the mapping definition as you specified it, supplemented with the fields `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

## Update a mapping definition

You update a mapping definition by PUTting a new version at `https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings/mapping_id`. You need to specify an entire new mapping definition, so when we talk about updating the mapping definition, we really mean replacing it.

Other than that, updating a mapping definition is the same as creating one: the request body is the same, the response body is the same.

## Delete a mapping definition

You delete a mapping definition by DELETEing it at `https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings/mapping_id`. That's all there is to it, really. You don't need to provide a request body and the response will be empty as well.

## List mapping definitions

You retrieve a list of all your mapping definitions by GETting it from `https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings`.

```http
GET https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings HTTP/1.1
"Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"
```

The response has a field `mappings` which contains a list with mapping definitions.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "mappings": [
    {
      "id": "01AB3DEF4GHIJ5KL67MNOP8QR9",
      "name": "A minimal example",
      "type": "only_mapped_keys",
      "created_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "02JK3LMN4OPQR5ST67UVWX8YZ9",
      "name": "A target example example",
      "type": "merge_with_target_example",
      "created_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rate limit

This endpoint is rate-limited to 25 requests per second, per Stedi account.

### Metadata

The list in the response doesn't contain complete mapping definitions; only metadata. It includes the fields `id`, `name`, `type`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`, but not the mapping expressions or the schema. If you're only displaying a list of mapping definitions, this is typically what you want, but should you need the full mapping definitions, you can set the query parameter `metadata_only` to `false`.

```http
GET https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings?metadata_only=false HTTP/1.1
"Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"
```

The response will now include the mapping expressions and the schemas.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "mappings": [
    {
      "id": "01AB3DEF4GHIJ5KL67MNOP8QR9",
      "name": "A minimal example",
      "type": "only_mapped_keys",
      "mapping": "{ \"total\": item.quantity * item.unit_price }"
      "created_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "02JK3LMN4OPQR5ST67UVWX8YZ9",
      "name": "A target example example",
      "type": "merge_with_target_example",
      "mapping": "{ \"total\": item.quantity * item.unit_price }",
      "target": {
        "name": "target.json",
        "type": "jsonschema@2020-12",
        "content": "{\"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\", \"default\": {\"total\": 0 }}"
      },
      "created_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-01-01T20:22:01.01Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Paging

If you have a lot of mapping definitions, you may not receive them all in one response. In that case, the response will contain a field `next_page_token`.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "mappings": [
    ...
  ],
  "next_page_token": "0t1H23ER4e5ArEMORE6REsU78l_TSyET"
}
```

You can make another request passing the value of that field to the query parameter `page_token` and you will receive the next few mapping definitions.

```http
GET https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings?page_token=0t1H23ER4e5ArEMORE6REsU78l_TSyET HTTP/1.1
"Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"
```

As long as the field `next_page_token` shows up in the response, there are more mapping definitions to retrieve.


# Mapping Definition Overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition



<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

A mapping definition describes how to turn input JSON into output JSON. It consists of several parts.

* A set of mapping expressions, describing how to transform input fields to output fields
* A mapping type, specifying how output fields are determined
* A target example, providing default values for output fields
* A set of schemas, describing what the input and output JSON should look like
* Lookup tables, to make converting values in mapping expressions easier

You must create a mapping definition for each JSON document type you want to transform. Then, you can use mapping definitions with the Mappings API to [transform JSON documents](/edi-platform/mappings/transform-json-documents) from one shape into another.

You can create mapping definitions with either the [Mappings UI](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/ui-guide) or the [Mappings API](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/api-guide).

## Mapping expressions

A mapping expression is a piece of code that specifies how to turn input fields into an output field. The following example shows how you could output a total price from a quantity and a unit price.

```jsonata
{ "total": item.quantity * item.unit_price }
```

On the left is the name of the output field, on the right is the mapping expression, written in [JSONata](https://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html). You can add more output fields, separated by commas.

```jsonata
{ "total": item.quantity * item.unit_price, "currency": item.currency, "product": product.id }
```

The result looks just like JSON, even though it technically isn't, because of the syntax of JSONata.

<Tip>
  Refer to [Write Mapping Expressions](/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata) for full
  details, examples, and JSONata resources.
</Tip>

## Mapping types

All mapping types produce output fields based on the mapping expressions.

The mapping type specifies how the Mappings API generates the output field when the mapping expression doesn't produce a value. A mapping expression may not produce a value when one or more of the input fields that the mapping expression depends on aren't present.

### Only mapped keys

By default, Mappings adds the target keys you selected to the output and nothing else.

The mappings API handles output fields in the following ways:

* Adds an output field for every mapping expression that returns a result
* Does not add output fields based on the target example
* Does not add output fields based on the input.

Consider the following mapping expression.

```jsonata
{ "currency": item.currency, "total": item.quantity * item.unit_price }
```

You provide the following input.

```json
{
  "item": {
    "unit_price": 2.5,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

The Mappings API produces the following output.

* The field `currency` is added to the output because there is a mapping expression for `currency` that produces a result.
* The field `total` is not added to the output. There is a mapping expression for `total`, but it doesn't produce a result because `item.quantity` is missing from the input.
* The fields `item.unit_price` and `item.currency` are not added to the output, because there are no mapping expressions for them.

```json
{
  "currency": 5
}
```

### Merge with target example

If you need to produce JSON based on a template, and you only need to change a handful of fields, it's easier if you copy the entire target to the output and only make those few changes. For example, you may want to use a default currency for your output.

The mappings API handles output fields in the following ways:

* Adds an output field for every mapping expression that returns a result
* Copies an output field from the target example, unless that output field was already added because of a mapping expression.
* Does not add output fields based on the input.

Consider the following mapping expressions.

```jsonata
{ "unit_price": item.price, "quantity": item.quantity, "total": item.quantity * item.price }
```

You use these expressions with the following target example.

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "quantity": 1,
  "unit_price": 0
}
```

You provide the following input.

```json
{
  "item": {
    "price": 2.5
  }
}
```

The Mappings API produces the following output.

* The field `currency` is copied from the target example because there is no mapping expression for `currency`.
* The field `unit_price` is not copied from the target example, because there is a mapping expression for `unit_price` that produces a result.
* The field `quantity` is copied from the target example. There is a mapping expression for `quantity`, but that one doesn't produce a result, because `item.quantity` is missing from the input.
* The field `total` doesn't end up in the output. There's a mapping expression for `total`, but it doesn't produce a result and the target example doesn't contain a default value for `total`.

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "unit_price": 2.5,
  "quantity": 1
}
```

### Pass through

If your output needs to be much like your input, but with a few values changed, then you can tell Mappings to start with a copy of your input.

The mappings API handles output fields in the following ways:

* An output field will be added for every mapping expression that returns a result.
* An output field will be copied from the input, unless that output field was already added because of a mapping expression.
* No output fields will be added based on the target example.

Consider the following mapping expressions.

```jsonata
{
  "item": { "quantity": item.quantity * items_per_unit },
  "tax_rate": tax_rate < 1 ? tax_rate + 1 : tax_rate,
  "total": item.quantity * item.price
}
```

You provide the following input.

```json
{
  "item": {
    "quantity": 5,
    "price": 2.5,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "tax_rate": 0.06
}
```

The Mappings API produces the following output.

* All fields are copied from the input.
* The field `tax_rate` is overwritten because there is a mapping expressions for `tax-rate` that produces a result.
* The field `item.quantity` is not overwritten. There is a mapping expressions for `item.quantity` , but it doesn't produce a result, because `items_per_unit` is missing from the input.
* The field `total` is added, because there's a mapping expression for `total` that produces a result.

```json
{
  "item": {
    "quantity": 5,
    "price": 2.5,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "tax_rate": 1.06,
  "total": 12.5
}
```

## Target example

The target example is a JSON object that provides default values in case a mapping expression doesn't return a result. For example, the following target example sets the default currency to `USD`.

```json
{
  "default": {
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

If the mapping expression can't determine the currency—for example because the input document doesn't contain currency information—then it uses the default from the target example. For this to work, the mapping type must be set to *Merge with target example*. Any other mapping type completely ignores the target example. Also, if you set the mapping type to *Merge with target example*, you must provide a target example. It can be empty, but it must be part of the mapping definition.

The target example is part of the target schema.

## Schemas

The Mappings UI uses the source and target schemas are used by the Mappings UI. If you don't plan on using the Mappings UI—i.e. you'll use the API exclusively—then you generally don't need to provide schemas. The only exception is when you want to provide [default values for your output fields](#target-schema).

Any schema you specify must be a valid [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) (version 2020-12). Also, each schema needs to be self-contained, so you can't include references to external schemas.

### Source schema

The Mappings UI uses the source schema to show an example of an input document. You can use this example to find and select the input fields you need in your mapping expressions. The following schema specifies three input fields: `quantity` , `unit_price` and `currency`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "quantity": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "unit_price": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "currency": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 3,
      "maxLength": 3
    }
  }
}
```

Just the schema isn't enough. You also need to provide some values for those fields. The Mappings UI uses the values to show what the output of a mapping expression will be like while you are crafting that expression, which is a useful feature. You can add values to the example by extending the source schema with a default document.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "quantity": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "unit_price": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "currency": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 3,
      "maxLength": 3
    }
  },
  "default": {
    "quantity": 15,
    "unit_price": 2.5,
    "currency": "CAD"
  }
}
```

### Target schema

The Mappings UI uses the target schema to show an example of an output document. You can only create mapping expressions for fields that are included in the target schema, so without a target schema, you can't use the Mappings UI. The following schema specifies two output fields: `total` and `currency`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "total": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "currency": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 3,
      "maxLength": 3
    }
  }
}
```

As with the source schema, you can add a default document to your target schema. Unlike with the source schema, this doesn't help with writing mapping expressions. However, if you want to provide default values for your output fields, adding a default document to your target schema is the way to do that. The following example sets the default currency to `USD`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "total": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "currency": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 3,
      "maxLength": 3
    }
  },
  "default": {
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

Default values only work if you set the mapping type to *Merge with target example*.

## Lookup tables

A lookup table helps the Mappings API convert a value from one representation to another. For example, the following table allows you to translate country names.

| english       | spanish        | german             |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| United States | Estados Unidos | Vereinigte Staaten |
| Mexico        | México         | Mexiko             |
| Germany       | Alemania       | Deutschland        |

There's no primary key in a lookup table. You can freely translate from English to Spanish, from Spanish to German, from German to English; any direction you want. You specify this in the mapping expression using the `$lookupTable` function. The following example uses the lookup table called `countries` to translate the input field `land` (which is German for *country*) from German to English.

```
{
  "country": $lookupTable($tables.countries, "german", land).english
}
```

The following example shows the same `countries` lookup table in JSON.

```json
[
  {
    "english": "United States",
    "spanish": "Estados Unidos",
    "german": "Vereinigte Staaten"
  },
  {
    "english": "Mexico",
    "spanish": "México",
    "german": "Mexiko"
  },
  {
    "english": "Germany",
    "spanish": "Alemania",
    "german": "Deutschland"
  }
]
```


# Mappings UI Builder
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/ui-guide



<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

[mappings-product]: https://stedi.com/app/mappings

[disconnect-a-guide]: #disconnect-a-guide

[pull-changes-from-a-guide]: #pull-changes-from-a-guide

You can create and edit mapping definitions with Stedi's visual mapping builder. Before you begin, we recommend reviewing the [Mapping Definitions Overview](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition).

## Create a mapping

Go to the [Mappings](https://portal.stedi.com/app/mappings) page in your Stedi account and click **Create mapping**. We recommend using the quickstart guide to create a mapping that matches your use case.

## Publish updates

You can edit a mapping at any time, unless it is [locked](#lock-a-mapping).

1. Go to the [Mappings](https://portal.stedi.com/app/mappings) page to review a list of existing mappings in your account. Stedi displays which mappings have unpublished changes.
2. Click a mapping's name to go to the Mappings builder and make updates. Stedi autosaves your changes as you work.
3. Click **Publish** to promote your changes to production.

It takes up to 15 seconds for Stedi to start applying changes you publish to your mappings.

## Lock a mapping

When you're finished editing, you can lock a mapping to prevent further updates. Locking helps prevent accidental changes or deletions to mappings in production.

<Warning>
  Don't lock a mapping unless you're sure you don't need to make any additional
  changes. Once you lock a mapping, only an account admin can unlock it.
</Warning>

To lock a mapping, open it, click the **...(elipses)** menu next to its name, and select **Lock settings**.

You can choose to lock the entire mapping, or just the mapping definition. When you lock the mapping definition only, you can still add or edit lookup tables, but you cannot edit the mapping source schema, target schema, or mapping expressions. This approach can be helpful when you expect to occasionally receive a new category of data for an existing field - for example, you need to update an existing lookup table with a new partner code or a new line of product SKUs.

No one can update or delete a locked mapping. However, you can duplicate locked mappings, if needed.

## Compare or roll back versions

You can compare the current version of a mapping with any previously published version to see what has changed. You can also roll back to a previous version of a mapping.

Open the **Actions** menu, and select **Version history** to review a list of every published version of the mapping. You can publish an older version or compare it with the current one. Comparing highlights every difference between the old version and the current version, similar to how GitHub displays changes on pull requests.

## Delete a mapping

<Warning>Once you delete a mapping, you cannot recover its data.</Warning>

To delete a mapping, click the ellipses (`...`) next to the mapping you want to delete, click **Delete**, and then confirm the deletion. The mapping is removed from your Stedi account.

## Define source and target JSON Schema

You must define a source and a target [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). The source schema describes your incoming data. The target schema describes the shape of the Mappings API output.

For example, if you need to transform [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) into a custom format for your internal systems, then the [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) is the source, and the payload your software understands is the target.

You can define the source and target JSON Schemas by doing one of the following:

* [Connect a Stedi event](#connect-a-stedi-event) as the source schema. You must do this when creating a mapping to use with a destination webhook.
* [Connect a stedi guide](#connect-a-stedi-guide) to your mapping. We recommend this approach when you are using mappings with to read or write EDI data according to partner-specific requirements.
* Add a [JSON example file](#add-a-json-example-file).
* Provide a [JSON Schema](#provide-a-json-schema) adhering to [version 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) that describes the shape of your data.

### Connect a Stedi event

<Warning>
  Destinations are a legacy feature and have been superseded by
  [Webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index). Please [contact
  support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) with questions or for help migrating.
</Warning>

You can attach a mapping to a [destination webhook](/edi-platform/configure/destinations/configure-destinations#transform-data-with-mappings) event binding. Stedi uses the mapping to transform the JSON data payload into the required shape before sending it to the configured destination.

You must choose **Event** as the source type when creating a mapping to use with a destination webhook.

If you choose the `transaction.processed.v2` or `fragment.processed.v2` event types, you must also select a Stedi guide to connect to the mapping. Once you've connected your guide, mappings generates the source schema based on the event type you chose and the connected guide.

### Connect a Stedi guide

You can generate the **Source** or **Target** schema from a [Stedi guide](/edi-platform/guides/). After you connect a guide, the mappings UI autogenerates the schema and sample JSON document with fields from the guide.

#### Requirements

You must have at least one Stedi guide in your account. You can manually create a guide from PDF EDI specifications or import a pre-made guide from the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network).

#### Connect a guide to the mapping

You can connect a guide to both the mapping’s **Source** and **Target** schema. To connect a guide:

1. Navigate to your mapping and edit either the **Source** or the **Target** document.
2. Go to the **Guide** tab to view a list of guides in your Stedi account.
3. Click **Connect** next to the guide you want to use.

Once you've connected your guide, mappings generates the schema and example document based on the guide. The **Schema** and **Example** tabs will become read-only. Refer to [Pull changes from a guide][pull-changes-from-a-guide] on updating the document data based on a guide. To change the schema or example, you must first disconnect the guide – refer to [Disconnect a guide][disconnect-a-guide].

#### Use fragments

If the guide is set up to use [Fragments](/edi-platform/fragments/index), Stedi updates your options:

* **Inbound fragments:** You can choose whether to create a mapping for the `transaction.processed.v2` event type or the `fragment.processed.v2` event type. Visit [Inbound Fragments](/edi-platform/fragments/inbound-fragments) for details.
* **Outbound fragments:** You can choose whether to create a mapping for the full transaction (no fragments), the fragment wrapper, or the fragment shape. Typically for outbound fragments you need to create two mappings: one mapping for the fragment shape to use with the [Stage Fragment](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/post-fragments) endpoint and one mapping for the fragment wrapper to use with the [Create Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint. Visit [Outbound Fragments](/edi-platform/fragments/outbound-fragments) for details.

#### Pull changes from a guide

Pulling the changes from a guide allows you to update the schema with the latest published changes made to a guide.

To pull changes from a guide:

1. Navigate to your mapping and edit the **Source** or the **Target** document.
2. Go to the **Guide** tab to view the status of the connected guide.
3. Click **Edit** for a document that connects with a guide.
4. Click **Pull changes**. For **Target** schemas, the mappings UI alerts you when guide changes affect existing expressions in the mapping.
5. If there are breaking changes, review them and decide whether you want to continue with the update.

#### Disconnect a guide

Disconnecting a guide preserves the current **Source** and **Target** schemas. Still, you will no longer be able to automatically update them based on the published changes to a guide. You can re-connect a guide at any time if needed.
To disconnect a guide from a mapping document:

1. Edit the **Source** or **Target** and go to the **Guide** tab.
2. Click **Disconnect** and **Confirm**.

### Add a JSON example file

When you add a JSON example file, the Mappings builder autogenerates the JSON Schema based on the example structure.

If you edit the JSON example file, the Mappings builder validates the changes against the existing JSON Schema. If the JSON document does not conform to the JSON Schema, you can either regenerate JSON Schema or update it manually.

<Warning>
  > JSON Schema regeneration might remove fields you defined in the JSON Schema
  > and did not add to the example file.
</Warning>

### Provide a JSON Schema

When you add a JSON Schema, the Mappings builder autogenerates an example JSON file based on the schema.

Your JSON Schema must define a `default` property that contains an example of data that adheres to the schema. Refer to the JSON documentation for more about [the `default` keyword](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/annotations).

When you upload a JSON Schema as either the source or target, Mappings builder uses the schema's `default` property to produce the mapping output. If the contents of the `default` property do not conform to the JSON Schema, you can manually amend the contents of the `default` property, amend the JSON Schema itself, or regenerate it automatically.

## Choose target keys

You can choose whether you want to include all or a subset of the incoming JSON fields in the output JSON file. By default, the Mappings builder uses all incoming target keys.

If you only need a subset of the fields that are in the sample select **Target keys**, to change which keys are included.

## Choose a mapping type

The mapping type specifies how the Mappings API generates the output field when the mapping expression doesn't produce a value.

You can select a mapping type from the dropdown menu in the **Output** section. You can choose between:

* Only mapped
* Merge with target
* Pass through

Refer to [Mapping Definition Overview](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition#mapping-types) for full details about each type and examples of how Mappings generates outputs based on your selection.

## Write mapping expressions

You must map each target key from the source JSON data to a property in the target JSON data. For example, you might map a `product ID` property from the source JSON to a `product number` property in the target JSON.

You do not need to do a one-to-one mapping of incoming properties to outgoing properties. You can create advanced expressions to map text properties to numbers, perform calculations, and more.

You can also use `omitField` to [exclude entire objects](/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/common-mapping-expressions#conditionally-omitting-objects) or [exclude fields](/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata/common-mapping-expressions#omitting-output-fields) from the output based on a condition. For example, you might only want your output to include the input field `totalPrice` when the number of products is larger than 0.

Visit [Common Mapping Expressions](/edi-platform/mappings/jsonata) for details and examples for common mapping use cases.

### Handling floating-point arithmetic

<Warning>
  It is not recommended to use JSONata for floating point arithmetic, such as
  financial calculations. Floating-point arithmetic can introduce rounding
  errors, which can accumulate and lead to incorrect results. Visit our [JSONata
  Playground](https://stedi.link/UKXfsxe) for an example. We recommend
  representing monetary values as integers (e.g. cents) and performing
  calculations on those integers.
</Warning>

Instead of JSONata, we recommend representing monetary values as integers (e.g. cents) and performing calculations on those integers.

## Export and import mappings

You can export an existing mapping and import it into another Stedi account.

To export a mapping, navigate to the [Mappings dashboard][mappings-product], click the ellipses (`...`) for the Mapping you want to export, and click **Export**. A .zip archive of the mapping data is downloaded to your machine.

To import a mapping .zip archive into a Stedi account: 1. Sign into the account and go to [Mappings dashboard][mappings-product]. 1. Click **Import**. 1. Either click **Upload** to choose a .zip archive from your machine or drag and drop the .zip archive onto the page. 1. Choose a **Mapping name** and click **Proceed with import**. The new mapping is now available in the Stedi account.

## Duplicate and version mappings

You may want to duplicate a mapping to create an updated version or to use an existing mapping as a starting point for a new one.

Duplicated mappings have a unique ID from the original that you can use in [Mappings API](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/api-guide) calls. This approach lets you quickly roll back to the previous version if necessary.

To duplicate a mapping:

1. Go to your [Mappings dashboard][mappings-product], click the ellipses (`...`) next to the mapping you want to duplicate, and select **Duplicate**.
2. Choose a name for the duplicated mapping and click **Duplicate**. The duplicated mapping is now available in your Stedi account.


# Invoke mappings
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/mappings/transform-json-documents



<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

Once you [create a mapping](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/ui-guide), you can use it to transform JSON into a custom shape.

## Inbound - Mappings API

You can use webhooks to automatically send transaction processed events to any API endpoint. Then, you can use the [Map Transaction Output](/api-reference/edi-platform/get-map-transaction-output) endpoint to return the mapped output of the processed inbound transaction.

You can also call the [Invoke Mapping API](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-invoke-mapping) to transform JSON into a custom shape.

## Outbound - Create Outbound Transaction

Call the [Create Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint with a mapping ID. Stedi uses the specified mapping to automatically transform your system’s data into Guide JSON before generating and delivering the EDI file.

### Payload validation

By default, the Mappings API doesn't validate incoming or transformed JSON.

When you enable **strict validation mode**, Mappings uses the [source schema](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition#source-schema)
to validate the input JSON payload and the [target schema](/edi-platform/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition#target-schema)
to validate the outgoing JSON payload.

To enable strict validation mode, set the `validation_mode` query parameter to `strict`. The following example shows how to enable strict validation mode in your request.

```http
POST https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings/01AB3DEF4GHIJ5KL67MNOP8QR9/map?validation_mode=strict HTTP/1.1
```

**Success and failure responses**

* If the mapping is evaluated successfully and there are no validation failures, the body of the response is the mapped document.
* If the evaluation of the mapping expression fails, then validation of the input and the output is not applied, the response is a 400 error with the `mapping_failed` code and no `validation_errors` object.
* If validation of the input or output payload fails, the response is a 400 error with the `validation_failed` code and `validation_errors` object.

### Example request

The following example shows a request to the [Invoke Mapping API](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-invoke-mapping). The request body is the JSON document that you want to map.

```http
POST https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings/01AB3DEF4GHIJ5KL67MNOP8QR9/map HTTP/1.1
"Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}"
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "quantity": 15,
  "unit_price": 2.50
}
```

The body of the response is the mapped document.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "total": 37.50
}
```

<Note>
  You must make a separate request to the API for each JSON document. Visit
  [Concurrency](#api-concurrency) for more details.
</Note>

## Send a compressed payload to the API

To send a `gzip` compressed payload to the Mappings API, set the `Content-Encoding` header to the value of `gzip`. Mappings API currently only supports `gzip` compression.

Note that the [maximum document size limit](/edi-platform/mappings/limits) **is applied after decompressing the content of the payload**. If the decompressed payload of a given request is larger than the maximum document size limit, the Mappings API will reject the request.

The following is an example written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) of creating mapping and sending a `gzip` compressed payload to the `/map` endpoint.

```ts
import axios from 'axios';
import { gzipSync } from 'zlib';

const STEDI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const rootURL = 'https://mappings.us.stedi.com/2021-06-01/mappings';
const headers = { Authorization: `Key ${STEDI_API_KEY}` };

async function doRequest() {
  const mapping = {
    name: 'GzipPayloadMapping',
    mapping: `{"Hello": keyFromSource}`,
    type: 'only_mapped_keys',
  };

  const createMappingResponse = await axios.post(rootURL, mapping, { headers });

  const payload = gzipSync(JSON.stringify({ keyFromSource: 'World!' }));
  const mapResponse = await axios.post(
    `${rootURL}/${createMappingResponse.data.id}/map`,
    payload,
    {
      headers: {
        ...headers,
        'Content-Encoding': 'gzip',
      },
    },
  );

  console.log(mapResponse.data);
}

async function main() {
  try {
    await doRequest();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
}

main();
```

## API concurrency

Mappings allows up to 200 concurrent requests, so if you need to map 200 documents or less, you can send them all at once. If you need to map more than 200 documents, you should make sure that you don't exceed 1000 requests per second. Also keep in mind that there's a maximum of one million requests per day.

If you make more requests than Mappings is able to handle, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

* Keep track of how many outstanding requests you have. Don't send any new requests if you have 200 or more.
* Keep track of how many total requests you've sent in a day and make sure it doesn't exceed 1,000,000.
* Keep a timestamp for every successful response you receive. When sending a new request, first check the timestamp for 1000 requests ago. If it's less than a second ago, wait until the second has passed before making a new request.
* If you receive a 429 Too Many Requests response, wait for one second before sending new requests. If you still get back 429 after waiting for one second, then wait for two seconds. If that's not enough wait for four, then eight, etc.
* If you receive a 429 Too Many Requests response, add the document back into the list of documents that you need to map. Don't resend the request immediately.


# Events types and structure
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/event-types



Stedi emits events as it processes and generates EDI files. You can use these events to trigger [webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index), trigger alerts in systems like Slack or PagerDuty, and implement more advanced functionality.

## Event types

Stedi emits the following types of events.

### Transaction processed

The `transaction.processed.v2` event is the primary integration point for transactions you receive from your trading partner. Stedi emits one `transaction.processed.v2` event for every transaction successfully processed.

Since an EDI file can contain multiple transactions, a single EDI file can result in multiple `transaction.processed.v2` events.

</Accordion>

When [fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) are enabled on the transaction, Stedi emits one `transaction.processed.v2` event and one `fragment.processed.v2` event for each fragment.

#### Retrieve transaction data

You can use the `documentDownloadUrl` URLs in the `event.detail.artifacts` objects to fetch transaction data from Stedi.

* Use the URL in the artifact with `"usage": "input"` to fetch the input for the transaction. For inbound transactions, this is the EDI you received from your trading partner.
* Use the URL in the artifact with `"usage": "output"` to fetch the output for the transaction. For inbound transactions, this is processed transaction data in [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format.

To retrieve transaction data, make a request with the URL and your Stedi API key for authorization.

If your HTTP library automatically follows redirects, you will receive the transaction data in the response body. If it does not follow redirects, the response includes a `documentDownloadUrl` that you can use to retrieve the transaction data.

The following example shows a cURL request to retrieve transaction data. This example uses the `-L` option for following redirects.

```curl
curl -L -H "Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}" \
    https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/transactions/$TRANSACTION_ID/output
```

### Fragment processed

<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

You can use [fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) to split transaction payloads into smaller chunks for easier downstream processing. By default, a single fragment will include a maximum of 800 repeated segments. You can customize the batch size when creating the [transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings#create-transaction-settings).

Stedi emits one `fragment.processed.v2` event for each fragment within a processed transaction. The payload contains details about the original transaction, including the `ISA` and `GS` headers. These details about the original transaction are included in every fragment event.

### File processed

You may want to consume `file.processed.v2` events when you want to route non-EDI files that arrive on Stedi for additional processing.

Stedi emits a `file.processed.v2` event for all successful file executions. You can view details on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.

For files with the following extensions, Stedi emits a `file.processed.v2` event but does not attempt to parse them as EDI: `.json`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.xls`, `.xlsx` or `.pdf`.

### File delivered

Stedi emits the `file.delivered.v2` event every time a file is successfully delivered to a [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections) for an outbound transaction set. This event is only emitted for generated EDI (outbound) files and is not emitted for inbound files.

### Retrieve execution data

Both the `file.delivered.v2` and `file.processed.v2` events include URLs in the `event.detail.artifacts` objects you can use to fetch execution data from Stedi.

* The URL for the `input` artifact allows you to retrieve the input to Stedi. For `file.processed.v2` events, this option is helpful when you want to react to and handle non-X12 inbound files flowing through Stedi, such as CSV, TSV, XML, and PDF files.
* The URL for the `output` artifact allows you to retrieve the output from Stedi. For `file.delivered.v2` events, this option retrieves the entire generated EDI file (including the envelope information) that Stedi delivered to your trading partner.
* The URL for the `metadata` artifact (`file.processed.v2` only) allows you to retrieve the execution metadata from Stedi, which includes the processing date and time, the control number, and other information about the file. Metadata is only supported for inbound x12 files.

To retrieve execution data, make a request with the URL and your Stedi API key for authorization.

If your HTTP library automatically follows redirects, you will receive the execution input data in the response body. If it does not follow redirects, the response includes a `documentDownloadUrl` that you can use to retrieve the transaction data.

The following example shows a cURL request to retrieve execution data. This example uses the `-L` option for following redirects.

```curl
curl -L -H "Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}" \
  https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/executions/$EXECUTION_ID/input
```

### File failed

Stedi emits `file.failed.v2` events in two scenarios:

* When a failure occurs while processing an inbound file. Stedi emits the `file.failed.v2` event at the file level. If a single transaction set fails, the entire file fails.
* When an outbound file cannot be delivered to a configured connection.
  {" "}
  Stedi attempts to deliver a file to all configured connections every 6 minutes for up to 3 total attempts. If it cannot deliver the file after the third attempt, it marks the file execution as `FAILED` and emits the [`file.failed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-failed). Stedi displays each delivery attempt and the failure details on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.

## Retry events

You can retrigger file processing events for successfully processed files. This feature makes it easier to test your end-to-end integration – for example, triggering webhooks – without continually reprocessing the same files.

To retry an event:

1. Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.
2. Click the name of the processed file.
3. Go to the **Events** tab.
4. Click the **ellipses (...)** next to an event and select **Retry**.

## When are events emitted?

Stedi emits events in the following scenarios.

### An entire file has successfully processed

Consider an EDI file that contains two functional groups, and a total of three transaction sets. When Stedi successfully processes all transaction sets, it generates the following events:

* 1x `file.processed.v2` - indicating the entire file was processed successfully.
* 3x `transaction.processed.v2` - one event for each transaction set found in both groups.

![X12 File where all Transaction Sets are processed successfully](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/core/successful-interchange.png)

### At least one transaction fails to validate

If one or more transaction sets in a file fails validation, Stedi emits a single `file.failed.v2` error, indicating that one or more transactions failed to process. Stedi cannot process the entire file until you address those issues.

![X12 File where one Transaction Set fails validation, blocking the entire file](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/core/failed-interchange.png)

## Event structure

All Stedi events follow a standard JSON Schema. The event payload itself does not include the contents of a given file or transaction. Instead, it references an API path to retrieve the entire object.

```json JSON event structure example
{
  "version": "0",
  "id": "8a9fc08a-24b2-4eeb-af7c-f96376ea471e",
  "detail-type": "transaction.processed.v2",
  "source": "stedi.core",
  "account": "012345678910",
  "time": "2021-11-12T00:00:00Z",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "detail": { ... }
}
```

In addition to their `version`, `id`, and `time`, events have the following fields:

* **`detail-type`** - Indicates the type of event, such as `transaction.processed.v2` or `file.failed.v2`
* **`source`** - Indicates the component that generated the event. All events use `source: “stedi.core”`.
* **`detail`** - The JSON payload. The schema for each payload is determined by the `detail-type`.


# Failures and retries
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/failures-and-retries



When Stedi encounters EDI processing failures, it displays them on the **Files** page and emits a [file.failed.v2](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-failed) event.

## Inbound EDI

When Stedi ingests EDI, it must first match the data to a [partnership](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/profiles-and-partnerships) and then validate the incoming EDI according to the partnership configuration. Failures may occur when the file does not contain sufficient heading data to match transactions to an existing partnership or when the incoming file contains invalid EDI.

Core only marks an incoming file as successfully processed when all the individual transaction sets within the file are valid against either the guide or the base X12 specification. If one transaction set is invalid, Stedi flags the entire file as failed.

Other processing failures may occur occasionally, most commonly for missing configuration or misconfigured data. Failure causes include:

* Stedi cannot find a profile record matching the ISA headers.
* Stedi cannot find a partnership record defined for the two profiles detected.
* Stedi received a corrupt or unparseable file.

## Outbound EDI

The Generate API uses a [Stedi guide](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings#using-guides) and other partnership settings to generate valid EDI with the proper envelope and control numbers. Failures may occur when tries to deliver the file to a configured [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections).

After generating EDI, Stedi marks the file as successfully processed after delivering it to all configured connections. Stedi does not display transactions from within files that have failed delivery.

Stedi attempts to deliver a file to all configured connections every 6 minutes for up to 3 total attempts. If it cannot deliver the file after the third attempt, it marks the file execution as `FAILED` and emits the [`file.failed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-failed). Stedi displays each delivery attempt and the failure details on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.

## Ignore failed files

Ignoring a failed file changes its status to **Ignored** and removes it from your list of failed files. You can bulk retry ignored files at any time or use filters to remove them from your dashboard view.

To ignore failed files individually:

1. Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page and click the name of the file you want to ignore.
2. Click **Ignore**.

To bulk ignore multiple failed files:

1. Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.
2. Filter the list to the failed files you want to ignore.
3. Click **Bulk actions** and select **Bulk ignore**.

## Retry files

To retry failed files individually:

1. Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page and click the name of the file you want to retry.
2. Click **Retry**.

To bulk retry all failed files:

1. Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.
2. Filter the list to show only failed files.
3. Click **Bulk actions** and select **Bulk retry**.

## Retry events

You can retrigger events for successfully processed files. This feature makes it easier to test your end-to-end integration – for example, triggering webhooks – without continually reprocessing the same files.

To retry an event:

1. Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page and click the name of the processed file.
2. Go to the **Events** tab.
3. Click the **ellipses (...)** next to an event and select **Retry**.

## Diagnosing failures

Stedi displays all of the events associated with each file execution and transaction in the dashboard. You can use this information to quickly debug issues and understand how your data flows through Stedi. Visit [Monitor transactions](/edi-platform/operate/transaction-data#manage-failed-file-executions) for details.


# File processing overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/file-processing-overview



![Inbound and Outbound file processing flow](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/diagrams/inbound-outbound-flow.svg)

Once you [add a trading partner](/edi-platform/configure/index), you can start exchanging EDI files.

## Inbound processing flow

When a new EDI file arrives over a [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections), Stedi automatically:

1. Confirms that the information in the file's `ISA` headers matches the corresponding partnership. If not, the file will error, and you can retry after creating the required configuration.
2. Identifies all available transaction sets in the file and validates them against the [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) for the partnership, either using the specified guide or the base X12 specification.
3. Translates the EDI transaction into [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json), using the JSON Schema defined by the guide.
4. Sends processing events to any configured [webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index).
5. Persists the original EDI file and the Guide JSON for review and retrieval and displays the transaction set data in the UI for inspection.

<Tip>
  Stedi can also route non-EDI files, such as CSV, XML, and JSON to your
  business system for further processing. [Learn
  more](/edi-platform/operate/parse-edi#non-edi-file-types)
</Tip>

## Outbound processing flow

When you use the API to generate EDI files, Stedi automatically:

1. Validates the [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) transaction payload against the guide attached to the [outbound transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) for the partnership. The API returns an error if validation is not successful.
2. Generates an EDI document that conforms to outbound transaction setting.
3. Persists the JSON payload and resulting EDI file.
4. Delivers the EDI file to your trading partner through the configured connection.
5. Displays the generated file on the **Files** page in the Stedi portal for review.
6. Emits a `file.delivered.v2` event and one or more `transaction.processed.v2` [events](/edi-platform/operate/event-types).


# Customize the ISA and GS headers
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi/envelope-overrides



You can customize an EDI file's Interchange (`ISA`) and Group (`GS`) headers - also known as the envelope - using the [Create Outbound Interchange](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-generate-edi) endpoint.

<Tip>
  If you don't need to customize the envelope, we strongly recommend generating
  EDI files with the [Create Outbound
  Transaction](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi/index) endpoint instead
  because it is simpler and easier to use.
</Tip>

## Interchange overrides

You can customize the following elements in the `ISA` header:

* **Interchange Authorization values** (`ISA-01` to `ISA-04`): Some trading partners require additional information in these elements to verify the transaction.
* **Interchange Version Control Number Code** (`ISA-12`): Stedi defaults to using the X12 release number of the guide associated with the transaction. However, some partners require a different release for the `ISA` envelope.
* **Acknowledgment Requested Code** (`ISA-14`): This code indicates whether you are requesting a `TA1` Interchange Acknowledgments.
* **Interchange Usage Indicator Code** (`ISA-15`): This code indicates whether data is test, production, or information. Stedi defaults to `P` for production data, but you may need to set this to `T` when sending test data.

Visit the [Create Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) documentation for more details.

</CodeGroup>

## Group overrides

By default, Stedi generates EDI files using the application IDs (`GS-02` and `GS-03` elements) configured for each profile within the partnership. However, some partners use multiple application IDs to route files to different locations.

To set custom application IDs, set the `localApplicationId` and the `partnerApplicationId` properties in the `override` object. These values are optional; you should only send them when you need to override the application IDs configured within each profile.

You can include multiple `overrides` objects to customize the application IDs for each transaction group in the file.

## Call the Interchange API

The [Create Outbound Interchange](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-generate-edi) endpoint can generate fully-formed EDI files containing multiple transactions and even multiple transaction types.

### Request data

The API uses the following data to generate and deliver an EDI file.

| Data                                     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `partnershipId`                          | Yes      | Include this ID within the API route to identify the associated partnership. You can find this ID on the [Trading partners](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page under **Partnership identifier**.                                                                                                        |
| `transactionGroups`                      | Yes      | The Generate API accepts multiple arrays of transactions in a single API call, allowing you to send multiple transactions or even multiple functional groups in a single file. If you only plan to send a single type of transaction (such as a Purchase Order), then your API request should have one transaction group. |
| `transactionGroups.transactionSettingId` | Yes      | This ID specifies the outbound transaction setting Stedi should use to validate the transaction data and generate the file. To find this ID, go to the partnership, find the outbound transaction setting, and copy its **Transaction Setting ID**.                                                                       |
| `transactionGroups.transactions`         | Yes      | This object contains the transaction data. It must conform to the [Guide JSON format](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) for the specified transaction setting.                                                                                                                                             |
| `filename`                               |          | Specify the name of the generated EDI file. Stedi overwrites files with the same name, so we recommend making the filename unique by including a timestamp or other identifier. If you do not specify a filename, Stedi autogenerates a unique name using a UUID.                                                         |
| Envelope overrides                       |          | You can use several optional parameters to customize aspects of the EDI envelope - both the [`ISA` header](#interchange-overrides) and [`GS` header](#group-overrides).                                                                                                                                                   |

### Sample request and response

The following example shows a cURL request and response.

The API returns the full X12 EDI file in the response. The response also includes an `artifactId` (equivalent to the file name) and a globally unique `fileExecutionId` that you can use to locate the generated file.

# Create outbound transaction
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi/index



Generate and deliver fully-formed EDI files to your trading partners with the [Create Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint.

This is the simplest way to send EDI files with Stedi.

![Generate EDI](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/diagrams/generate-edi.svg)

## Format transaction data

Unless you’re using [mappings](/edi-platform/mappings), you must submit transaction data to the API in [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json), a format that matches the JSON Schema of the guide associated with the outbound transaction setting.

### Guide JSON schema

To find the JSON Schema for a transaction:

1. Navigate to the [Trading partners page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships).
2. Select the partnership.
3. Click the name of the guide associated with the outbound transaction setting.
4. Open the **Actions** menu and select **View schema**.
5. This is the JSON Schema you must use when sending transaction data to the API. You must include every segment and element marked as required in the guide.

You can also use the [send outbound test files](/edi-platform/operate/generate-test-files) feature to generate a sample JSON payload that matches your guide's JSON Schema. You can then edit the sample payload as needed.

### Mapping ID and schema

<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

You can optionally specify a mapping to transform transaction data from your system into Guide JSON format. In this case, you must send data to the API in the mapping’s source JSON Schema.

To find the mapping ID and schema:

1. Go to the [Mappings page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/mappings) and copy the ID field for the mapping you want to use.
2. Click the mapping’s name to view its details.
3. Click **Test mapping**. The test input JSON shape is the shape you must use when sending transaction data to the API.

## Call the API

When you call the Create Outbound Transaction endpoint, Stedi:

1. Applies the mapping (if present) to the provided transaction data.
2. Adds [fragments](/edi-platform/fragments) from specified fragment groups (if present).
3. Generates an EDI file according to the Stedi guide attached to the [outbound transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings#create-transaction-settings). This includes adding required envelope information (`ISA` and `GS` headers) and autogenerated control numbers.
4. Delivers the EDI file to your trading partner through the [connection](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/connections/index) specified in the outbound transaction setting.

### Create request

The API uses the following data to generate and deliver an EDI file.

| Data                   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API key                | Yes      | You must pass a Stedi API key in the `Authorization` header of every request. You can [create an API key](/api-reference/index#authentication) in the Stedi portal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `partnershipId`        | Yes      | Include this ID in the API route to identify the associated partnership. You can find this ID on the [Trading partners](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page under **Partnership identifier**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `transactionSettingId` | Yes      | Include this ID in the API route to identify the outbound transaction setting Stedi should use to validate the transaction data and generate the file. To find this ID, go to the partnership, find the outbound transaction setting, and copy its **Transaction Setting ID**.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Sample request and response

The following example shows a cURL request and response.

The API returns a globally unique `fileExecutionId` that you can use to locate the generated file.

## Acknowledgments

Stedi can automatically generate 997 or 999 acknowledgments for every inbound transaction associated with a partnership, so you should not need to use the API to send 997s or 999s. Visit [Acknowledgments](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/functional-acknowledgments) for details on enabling this functionality.

## Timezone and time format

Stedi uses the following default values:

* **Timezone:** UTC | Used in the `ISA` and `GS` segments
* **Time format:** `HHMMSS` | The [GS-05](https://www.stedi.com/edi/x12/segment/GS#GS-05) time element

You can change these values in the partnership's **Advanced settings** menu.

## Character sets

By default, Stedi doesn't enforce any character restrictions for outbound files. As long as the payload is valid JSON that meets the guide's JSON Schema, Stedi can generate an EDI file and deliver it to your trading partner.

However, some trading partners may have restrictions on the characters they can accept. For example, certain partners may only accept a subset of characters called the Basic Character Set, which doesn't include lowercase or special characters. Others may accept the Extended Character Set, which has a more expansive set of character options. Others in the healthcare industry may use the HIPAA Extended Character Set, which is a subset of the Extended Character Set (note that HIPAA guidelines require the use of either the Basic or HIPAA Extended character set for HIPAA transactions).

### Restrict characters in outbound files

You can select a character set to use when generating outbound files in the partnership's **Advanced settings** menu.

Once you select a character set, Stedi rejects EDI generation requests that contain characters outside of the specified set. For example, if you select the **Basic** character set, Stedi rejects requests that contain lowercase letters and other unsupported characters.

There are three character set options.

#### Basic Character Set

Includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

In order to be compliant with X12 HIPAA guidelines, all trading partners must support the Basic Character Set at a minimum.

The following special characters are included:

![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)

#### HIPAA Extended Character Set

Includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@` and `#`.

X12 HIPAA guidelines state the following:

> In the absence of a specific trading partner agreement to the contrary, trading partners will assume that the \[HIPAA] extended character set is acceptable.

The following additional special characters are included:
![HIPAA Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/hipaa-extended-special-characters.png)

#### Standard Extended Character Set

Includes the characters in HIPAA Extended, plus select additional language characters, such as `ñ`. The standard Extended Character Set is the most common character set outside of healthcare (for example, in retail and logistics).

According to HIPAA guidelines, the Standard Extended character set is not allowed in HIPAA-compliant transactions (see X12 RFI [2212](https://x12.org/resources/requests-for-interpretation/rfi-2212-language-characters-837)).

The following additional language characters are included:
![Standard Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/standard-extended-special-characters.png)

### Character set questionnaire

You can send the [X12 Character Set questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQBLskIvfhMBdze77YjUrfHw_htV_2ZzhdHBqoGWBLU/edit) to your trading partners to determine which characters they support, and thus which character set you should use when generating outbound files.

## Custom filenames

You can specify a custom filename for the generated EDI file either in the [outbound transaction setting](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings#outbound-custom-filename-expression) or with the `filename` field in your API request. If you don't specify a filename, Stedi autogenerates one using a UUID.

## Payload limits

Without a mapping, the Create Outbound Transaction endpoint accepts payloads up to 5MB. With a mapping, the payload must be \< 4MB. You can use [outbound fragments](/edi-platform/fragments/outbound-fragments) to split larger transactions into smaller chunks before sending them to the API.

If this presents issues for your integration, please [let us know](https://www.stedi.com/contact), and we can help develop a solution.


# Generate test files in your browser
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/generate-test-files



You can generate and process inbound and outbound test files to simulate exchanging files with your trading partner.

You can review generated test files on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page and all processed transactions on the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page.

## Inbound test files

Generating an inbound test file triggers any configured [webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index), so this is a great method for testing your entire inbound EDI processing flow.

To generate and send an inbound test file:

1. Do one of the following:
   * Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.
   * Go to the [Trading partners](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page, click a partnership, and go to its inbound transaction settings.

2. Click **Test inbound**.

3. Select a **Partnership** and an **Inbound transaction setting**.

4. Edit the **Transaction payload** to include realistic or actual data from your system. The payload editor validates your data as you change it.

   * If the guide associated with this transaction setting has sample files, you can choose a **Sample** and load its data into the editor.

5. Click **Ingest file**.

Stedi immediately begins processing the file. The processed file will trigger any configured webhook.

## Outbound test files

Outbound test files contain a `T` in the `Usage` element of the ISA header. This indicates that the file is a test file and should not be processed by your trading partner's production system. Sometimes, your trading partner will provide you with a dedicated test SFTP/FTPS or AS2 connection. If they have done so, be sure to assign the test connection to your outbound transaction setting.

To generate and send an outbound file:

1. Do one of the following:
   * Go to the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page.
   * Go to the [Trading partners](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/partnerships) page, click a partnership, and go to its outbound transaction settings.

2. Click **Test outbound**.

3. Select a **Partnership** and an **Outbound transaction setting**.

4. (Optional) Set **Advanced settings**. For example, you may want to set a **Filename** if your trading partner has specific requirements for the file name. If you do not specify a filename, Stedi generates a unique file name using a UUID.

5. Edit the **Transaction payload** to include realistic or actual data from your system. The payload editor validates your data as you change it.

   * If the guide associated with this transaction setting has sample files, you can choose a **Sample** and load its data into the editor.

6. Click **Continue** and then click **Send EDI**.

Stedi immediately begins generating the test file and sends it to your trading partner over the configured connection.


# Parse EDI
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/parse-edi



Stedi automatically validates and parses inbound EDI files in real time, according to the [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) you defined for the trading partner.

## Files with multiple EDI interchanges

Stedi can process files containing multiple EDI interchanges as long as the interchanges have the same partnership and direction (every `ISA` header must have the same sender and receiver IDs). Stedi emits a `file.processed.v2` event for the file and one `transaction.processed.v2` event for each transaction within the file.

You can review each processed interchange on the file's details page in the Stedi portal.

## Send transactions to your business system

You can use [webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index) to automatically send `transaction.processed.v2` events to any API endpoint. The [`transaction.processed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#event-types) contains a URL that you can then use to fetch processed transaction data from Stedi.

## Transform transactions to a custom shape

Stedi translates EDI files into [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json), a JSON format that closely reflects the structure of an EDI transaction. You need to transform Guide JSON into a shape your system can understand and ingest.

Visit [Transformation approaches](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/transformation-approaches) for details.

## Large file support

<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

If you need to process EDI files over 10 MB in size, we recommend adding the Large file processing module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.

You may also want to use [Fragments](/edi-platform/fragments), a module that helps you split processed transactions from Stedi into smaller chunks for downstream ingestion.

## Non-EDI file types

Stedi can route non-EDI formats like CSV, JSON, and XML for further processing.

When a non-EDI file arrives, the file appears in the UI, and Stedi emits an event that contains a summary of the file execution. You can configure webhooks that forward this event to your business system.

How Stedi processes non-EDI files depends on the file extension:

* Stedi emits a [`file.processed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-processed) for all files with `.json`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.xls`, `.xlsx` or `.pdf` file extensions.
* Stedi attempts to process any other file extension, such as .`txt` or `.edi`, as EDI. If parsing fails, it attempts to parse the file first as JSON and then as CSV. If parsing still fails, it will mark the execution as failed and emit a [`file.failed.v2` event](/edi-platform/operate/event-types#file-failed), which can be used to trigger additional processing.

## Processing limits

Stedi can process EDI files that are gigabytes in size, and there is no hard restriction on the maximum file size you can attempt to process. If you run into issues processing a large file, please [reach out](https://www.stedi.com/contact) and our engineers will help remove any limitations that you're encountering.


# Monitor transactions
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/transaction-data



You can monitor, inspect, test, and debug the transaction data flowing through Stedi.

## Filter and sort

You can review all incoming and outgoing transaction data on the [**Files**](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) and [**Transactions**](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) pages.

### Files

Each file sent or received can contain multiple transactions. The [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page shows every file you have exchanged with trading partners, its processing status, and the number of transactions within the file.

You can filter files by various attributes, including status (such as `Failed` or `Completed`), direction, partnership, and fault (such as `failed to find guide`).

### Transactions

Individual [**Transactions**](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) only appear after an entire file has been successfully processed. Every transaction that has been successfully sent to or received from your trading partners appears in this list.

You can filter transactions by various attributes, including transaction set, sender, receiver, direction, and usage (such as `production` or `test`). You can also search for specific transaction sets based on a business identifier, such as a purchase order number.

## Inspect raw data

You can review the raw EDI or JSON data for processed files and individual transactions. Click the name of the file or transaction to review its data.

### View a file execution

The file execution detail page contains processing results and the entire source of the original, unmodified file. You can copy or download the source file to your local machine.

### View a transaction

The transaction detail page includes two tabs that display different levels of information.

* **Details:** Displays metadata about the transaction, including the sender, receiver, the guide used for validation, and more.
* **Inspector:** Shows the transaction payload in a human-friendly view, which you can use to understand the contents of the transaction.

You can also view and download the raw EDI or JSON data for a transaction.

<Tip>
  **Advanced EDI users:** When viewing the raw EDI for a single transaction, the
  transaction EDI view includes the ISA (Interchange Control Header) and GS
  (Functional Group Header) from the source file. However, it does not include
  any other transaction sets that were in the source file, so the segment counts
  may not total correctly.
</Tip>

## Manage failed files

You can review the processing status for all incoming and outgoing files on the **Files** page.

You can individually retry or ignore failed files. You can also bulk retry or ignore multiple files at once.

* To bulk retry, click **Retry**. Core automatically retries processing for every file with the Failed status.
* To bulk ignore, click **Ignore**. You may want to ignore executions when they contain an outdated version of a file that you no longer need to retry.

Typically, you would retry a file execution if you have resolved the issue that caused the failure. For example, if a file failed because it was missing a required segment, you could retry the file execution after marking the segment as optional in the guide. You would ignore a file execution if you do not want to reprocess the file. For example, if you inputted the failed file to your system manually, you could ignore the file execution to prevent it from being processed again.

### Bulk processing

Before you initiate a bulk retry or ignore, you can filter the list of files to only show the files you want to take action on. For example, you could filter the list to show only files with a certain fault reason, and then bulk retry or ignore all of those files.

To bulk retry or ignore, click **Retry** or **Ignore**. After a confirmation step, Stedo triggers a retry or ignore for every file with the `Failed` status that matches your selected filters.

## Data retention

Artifacts refer to the transaction and file execution payloads from files Stedi has processed. They contain the actual input/output transaction data in EDI, JSON, or another format. Artifacts do not include the metadata about a transaction or file execution, such as whether it was processed successfully.

By default, Stedi retains your artifact files for 10 years. In some cases, you may want Stedi to remove artifacts to comply with PII/PHI retention policies. You can configure data retention on the [EDI Settings](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/settings) page.


# Guide JSON format
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json



Stedi's native format for EDI transactions is called Guide JSON. It closely reflects the structure of an EDI transaction, but uses JSON instead of EDI syntax.

* When you [Generate EDI](/edi-platform/operate/generate-edi), Stedi accepts Guide JSON as input, and delivers a fully-validated EDI file to your partner.
* Stedi [parses inbound EDI](/edi-platform/operate/parse-edi) into Guide JSON format.

## Example

The following example shows an Amazon 850 Purchase Order in both X12 EDI and Guide JSON formats. The EDI format is in the first tab, and the Guide JSON is in the second tab.

## What is Guide JSON?

Guides are Stedi's machine-readable representation of the EDI specifications that your trading partners provide to you (typically in the form of PDF, Excel, or Word files), or that you provide to your trading partners. You can view and import guides from popular trading partners in the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network).

Each guide is backed by a JSON Schema that defines the structure of the EDI transaction. **Guide JSON** is JSON data that conforms to the **guide's** schema.

### How Stedi uses Guide JSON

* **Inbound files:** Stedi uses the inbound [transaction settings](/edi-platform/configure/trading-partners/transaction-settings) within the partnership to determine which Stedi guide to use for validation and translation. If validation is successful, Stedi parses the file into one or more transactions, and outputs them in Guide JSON.
* **Outbound files:** You supply Stedi's [Generate Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint with transaction data in the Guide JSON format. Stedi uses that data to generate an EDI file and deliver it to your trading partner.

### Find a guide's JSON Schema

To find the JSON Schema for a guide:

1. Navigate to the [Guides](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides) page in your Stedi account.
2. Click the guide you want to view.
3. Open the **Actions** menu and select **View schema**.

## How Guide JSON formats vary

Guide JSON formats vary in three ways. You must account for these differences when you receive Guide JSON webhooks for inbound transactions, and when you call the Generate EDI API to send outbound transactions.

### Transaction type

Since a guide can represent any of the 300+ EDI transaction types, the Guide JSON (and corresponding JSON Schema) will differ depending on the transaction type. For example, the Guide JSON for an 850 Purchase Order will be different than the Guide JSON for an 810 Invoice. This means that the payloads that you receive from Stedi via webhook will vary depending on the transaction type, and the payloads that you send to the Generate EDI API will also vary depending on the transaction type.

### Release

X12 has 30+ releases, or versions. There are often breaking changes between X12 releases, which makes it impossible to reliably canonicalize transactions across releases. Since different trading partners use different releases, the Guide JSON you have to accept from and provide to Stedi differ depending on the release. For example, the Guide JSON for an 850 Purchase Order in X12 release `004010` will be different than the Guide JSON for an 850 Purchase Order in X12 release `005010`.

### Trading partner

Since different trading partners use different EDI specifications, the Guide JSON may differ depending on the trading partner. For example, the [Amazon Retail 855 PO Acknowledgment](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/amazon/retail-purchase-order-acknowledgment/01H25HYSGSFKB0P1G99H31K9YP#properties.detail.properties.baseline_item_data_PO1_loop.items.properties.pricing_information_CTP) allows you to optionally specify pricing information in the `CTP` segment, but the [Walmart 855](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/walmart-edi/purchase-order-acknowledgment/01GNZA51CHFJJD9Y75GSSCXHHW#properties.detail.properties.baseline_item_data_PO1_loop.items.properties.baseline_item_data_PO1) does not.


# Choose a transformation approach
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/transformation-approaches



Stedi supports three ways to transform transaction data to and from [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format: Stedi Mappings, writing custom code, and using an iPaaS platform.

The approach you choose depends on your circumstances and preferences.

## Stedi Mappings

<Note>
  This functionality is available in a Stedi module. [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) for details.
</Note>

[Stedi Mappings](/edi-platform/mappings) is a powerful JSON-to-JSON transformation engine. You can build mappings using Stedi's visual mapper and use mappings to transform data for both inbound and outbound transactions.

* **Inbound transactions**: Configure [webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index) to send `transaction.processed.v2` events to your API. Then use the [Map Transaction Output](/api-reference/edi-platform/get-map-transaction-output) endpoint to return the mapped output of the processed inbound transaction.
* **Outbound transactions**: Call the [Create Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint with a mapping ID. Stedi uses the specified mapping to automatically transform your system's data into Guide JSON before generating and delivering the EDI file.

### When to use

We recommend using Stedi Mappings when:

* Your system can natively produce and consume JSON payloads. Mappings is designed to map one JSON shape to another JSON shape. If your system uses another format like XML or CSV, Mappings isn't a fit.

* You plan to do one-step transformations without multi-step processing. For example, you need to reshape a Guide JSON payload to post to a simple API endpoint.

* You want your business or operations team to manage mappings. The first few mappings typically require an engineer and often some pairing help from Stedi's Customer Success team. Once you build a few examples, business users can often edit, maintain, and build mappings independently.

* You want a solution that's integrated with the Stedi platform. Stedi's Mappings product is integrated with Stedi Guides, making it easier to build mappings from any Guide JSON Schema and test mappings using sample Guide JSON payloads. You can also control which users can view, edit, and deploy mappings with [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/accounts-and-billing/index#assigning-member-roles).

### Cons

We don't recommend using Mappings alone to build the end-to-end functionality for use cases requiring dynamic lookups or multi-step processing.

In many integrations, you need to translate Guide JSON into your system's API shape and then dynamically look up internal IDs from a constantly-changing list. For example, you might need to call out to an ERP or API to look up a customer's ID and use that information to replace values in the JSON object before posting to an API.

To accomplish this flow, you would need to first transform the Guide JSON into your system's API shape using Mappings and then use your own codebase or iPaaS platform to perform the lookups and replace the values. This is a viable option, but the approach requires maintaining the transformation steps in two separate systems – the field mappings in Stedi's Mapping product, and the dynamic lookups in custom code or an iPaaS platform. If you prefer to keep all of your logic in one place, you can do all of the transformations in your own codebase or an iPaaS platform, without using Stedi Mappings.

## Custom code

You receive transaction data from Stedi in [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format.
You write the required logic to transform Guide JSON to your preferred format and
run it on your infrastructure.

* **Inbound transactions**: Retrieve the processed transaction data as-is. Your transformation code will map that payload into your system’s format and deliver it to the ultimate destination.
* **Outbound transactions**: Transform your system’s data into Guide JSON and call the [Create Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint to generate the EDI file and deliver it to your trading partner.

### When to use

We recommend writing custom transformation code when:

* You want to manage data transformations and business logic in your own codebase. For example, you want to write tests and and deploy changes using your existing CI/CD pipeline.

* You only need a small number of mappings that won't change very often. For example, a large retailer may use a single 850 Purchase Order guide for all of their suppliers and create a single mapping that transforms their internal API format into the 850 Guide JSON format.

* You can have engineers involved in every mapping change. Engineers will need to make the changes and ensure that every change is well-tested and deployed in a controlled manner.

* You need to perform complex lookups or multi-step processing. For example, you need to dynamically replace values in the JSON object prior to posting to your API.

### Cons

Coding your own mappings can be cumbersome when you need to build more than a few mappings or your mappings change frequently. For example, a logistics platform may need to support hundreds of different 204 Load Tender formats from different carriers, each with their own mapping.

Generating and maintaining many custom mappings usually requires a lot of coordination between business and engineering teams, which can lead to delays in getting new mappings into production.

## iPaaS platforms

iPaaS platforms like Workato or Tray.io are purpose-built to allow non-engineers to integrate and automate business processes. Just like you can use an iPaaS platform to integrate your ERP or custom system with Salesforce or Shopify, you can use an iPaaS platform to integrate your system with Stedi.

* **Inbound transactions**: Configure [webhooks](/edi-platform/configure/webhooks/index) to trigger a workflow run once Stedi has successfully processed a transaction. The workflow should transform the Guide JSON into your system’s format and then use a pre-built or custom connector to deliver the transformed payload to your system.
* **Outbound transactions**: You can use the iPaaS platform’s built-in functionality to map your system’s data into Guide JSON, and then use the iPaaS platform’s pre-built HTTP connector to call the [Create Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint with the transformed payload.

### When to use

We recommend using an iPaaS platform when:

* You want to leverage iPaaS functionality. iPaaS platforms offer a wide variety of functionality that is useful for integration scenarios, such as a graphical interface to build integration flows, pre-built connectors, support for API creation and management, data mapping tools, and the ability to orchestrate complex integration scenarios involving multiple endpoints.
* You're already using an off-the-shelf business system (such as a CRM, ERP, or TMS) that is supported by the iPaaS platform.
* You want to build and maintain EDI integrations without involving engineers.

### Cons

* You need a separate subscription to an iPaaS platform, which incurs an additional cost. However, this approach often ultimately reduces costs over time because you don't need engineers to build or maintain your integrations.
* You will need to keep your mapping shape definitions in sync between Stedi and the iPaaS platform. For example, if you update a Stedi Guide to include a new field, you must 1) update any mappings that use the new field and then 2) update the schema in the iPaaS platform. These duplicate updates can be cumbersome and lead to processing errors if not completed in sync.
  <Tip>
    If your iPaaS platform supports [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), you
    can export the Guide JSON Schema from Stedi and import it to your iPaaS
    platform. This approach allows you to use the iPaaS platform's built-in data
    mapping tools to map your system's data into Guide JSON and will make it
    easier to update the schema as it changes.

# Overview - Transform Guide JSON
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/transforming-data



Similar to working with transactions from platforms like Stripe or Shopify, you need
to transform Stedi's [Guide JSON](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/guide-json) format to and
from a shape that your system can understand.

## Inbound transactions

Stedi parses and translates inbound files from your trading partner into Guide JSON format. You can then choose a [transformation approach](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/transformation-approaches) to reshape it into your system's format.

## Outbound transactions

For outbound transactions, you need to call the [Generate Outbound Transaction](/api-reference/edi-platform/post-transactions) endpoint with a Guide JSON payload. For example, you may need to translate employee records exported from your internal database into Guide JSON to create an 834 Benefit Enrollment file.

Prior to calling the API, you can choose a [transformation approach](/edi-platform/operate/transform-json/transformation-approaches) to reshape data from your system into Stedi's Guide JSON format.


# Batch refresh checks
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/batch-refresh-eligibility-checks



You may want to periodically conduct asynchronous batch eligibility checks for your entire patient population or a subset of patients, such as those who have active care plans or who have future services scheduled. These data refreshes allow you to proactively reach out to patients when they lose or change coverage, preventing surprises and billing delays.

Batch checks have a longer feedback cycle than real-time checks because you don't receive the payer's response immediately. That's why we strongly recommend starting with [real-time checks](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) when integrating with a new payer or working with eligibility checks for the first time. This approach allows you to ensure that your pipeline is working smoothly before you begin staging batch checks.

## Send batch checks

You can use Stedi's [Batch Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-batch-eligibility) API to submit up to 500 eligibility checks in a single request. Stedi processes these eligibility checks asynchronously, implementing best practices to avoid payer throttling.

Asynchronous batch checks don’t count toward your Stedi account [concurrency budget](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#api-concurrency-limit). This allows you to stage thousands of batch checks while continuing to send real-time eligibility checks simultaneously.

### Headers

You must include the following Stedi-specific headers in your API request:

* **`Authorization`:** [Generate an API key](/api-reference/index#authentication) to use for authentication.
* **`Content-Type`:** Set to `application/json`.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://manager.us.stedi.com/2024-04-01/eligibility-manager/batch-eligibility \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

### Body

The information you provide to the payer in an eligibility check can vary, depending on the circumstances. However, each batch eligibility check must include the following information in the request body:

| Information                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `tradingPartnerServiceId`                      | You can find the payer ID in our list of [supported payers](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network). If you don't know the payer, try submitting an [insurance discovery check](/healthcare/insurance-discovery) instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `submitterTransactionIdentifier`               | A unique identifier for the eligibility check within the batch. Stedi returns this identifier in the response for the [Poll Batch Eligibility Checks](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-polling-eligibility) endpoint so you can correlate benefit responses with the original eligibility check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `provider` object, name                        | You must include the provider's name - either the `firstName` and `lastName` of a specific provider within a practice or the `organizationName`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `provider` object, identifier                  | You must include an identifier. Most often this is the [National Provider Identifier (NPI)](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `subscriber` and/or `dependents` objects       | At a minimum, our API requires that you supply at least one of these fields in the request: `memberId`, `dateOfBirth`, or `lastName`. However, each payer has different requirements, so you should supply the fields necessary for each payer to identify the subscriber in their system. When all four of `memberId`, `dateOfBirth`, `firstName`, and `lastName` are provided, payers are required to return a response if the member is in their database. Some payers may be able to search with less information, but this varies by payer. We recommend always including the patient's member ID when possible. Learn more about [patient information](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#patient-information). |
| `encounter` object, service dates              | You can specify either a single `dateOfService` or a `beginningDateOfService` and `endDateOfService`. The payer defaults to using the current date in their timezone if you don't include one. We recommend submitting dates up to 12 months in the past or up to the end of the current month. Dates outside of these ranges are likely to be rejected by many payers, since they may have archived older data and they cannot guarantee eligibility for future months. Eligibility also usually starts and ends on month boundaries.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `encounter` object, service or procedure codes | Specify `serviceTypeCodes` and/or a `procedureCode` and `productOrServiceIDQualifier` to request specific types of benefits information. Medical providers should set `items.encounter.serviceTypeCodes` to a single value of `30` - Health Benefit Plan Coverage, and dental providers should set it to `35` - Dental Care. Stedi supports all service type codes, but some payers may not support other values. Don't include multiple service type codes because many payers will either return an error or ignore additional codes entirely. If you do not include any of these fields, Stedi defaults to using `30` (Plan coverage and general benefits) as the only `serviceTypeCodes` value.                    |

#### Character restrictions

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

Don't include the following characters in your request data: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. They are reserved for delimiters in the resulting X12 EDI transaction, and X12 doesn't support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include these restricted characters in your request.

#### Patient information

Batch checks should follow the same best practices as real-time eligibility checks when entering patient information. Visit [Real-time eligibility checks](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#patient-information) for guidance on:

* Which patient identifiers to use for best results
* How to know if a patient qualifies as a dependent
* How to enter patient names for best results

#### MBI for CMS checks

A Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) is a unique, randomly-generated identifier assigned to individuals enrolled in Medicare. You must include the patient’s MBI in every eligibility check to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Payer ID: CMS).

Some payers return the patient's MBI in one of the following properties of the standard eligibility response:

* [`benefitsInformation.benefitsAdditionalInformation.hicNumber`](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility#response-benefits-information-benefits-additional-information-hic-number)
* [`planInformation.hicNumber`](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility#response-plan-information-hic-number)

If the value in either of these properties matches the format specified in the [Medicare Beneficiary Identifier documentation](https://www.cms.gov/training-education/partner-outreach-resources/new-medicare-card/medical-beneficiary-identifiers-mbis), the number is likely an MBI, and we recommend sending a follow-up eligibility check to CMS for additional benefits data. You're most likely to receive an MBI in eligibility check responses from commercial Medicare Advantage plans, but they can also be present in responses from Medicaid plans for dual-eligible patients.

When you don't know a patient's MBI, you can use Stedi's eligibility check APIs to perform an MBI lookup using their Social Security Number instead. Stedi returns a complete benefits response from CMS with the patient's MBI in the `subscriber` object for future reference. Visit [Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) lookup
](/healthcare/mbi-lookup) for complete details.

### Sample request and response

The following example demonstrates how to submit a batch of eligibility checks in the `items` array, where each item represents an individual eligibility check. Stedi returns a `batchId` that you can use to retrieve the results of these checks later.

Visit [Determine patient benefits](/healthcare/eligibility-active-coverage-benefits) for details about how you can use the benefits response to determine a patient's coverage status and benefits.

## Retrieve batch results

After you've submitted a batch of eligibility checks, you can use the [Poll Batch Eligibility Checks](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-polling-eligibility) endpoint to retrieve the results. Only completed checks are included in the response. Stedi retries checks that fail due to payer processing issues for up to 8 hours.

We recommend beginning to poll after 2 minutes, using an exponential backoff with jitter. For example, you might use something similar to the following formula:

```
wait_time = min(120 * 2^attempt, max_wait) + random(0, 30s)
```

In this formula:

* `120`: Initial wait time (2 minutes)
* `attempt`: Current retry attempt number (0-based)
* `max_wait`: Maximum wait time cap (8 hours)
* `random(0, 30s)`: Random jitter between 0-30s

## Minimize waste

We recommend the following to optimize batch eligibility checks:

* Periodically purge or archive records for inactive patients. It's a waste to perform eligibility checks on patients who have died or who haven't scheduled an encounter for several years.
* Remove or deactivate patients that are no longer eligible. The payer indicates ineligibility by setting `benefitsInformation.code = “6”` (Inactive) in the response.

## Monitor for potential coverage loss

When you receive the results of your batch eligibility checks, look for patients who have coverage that may be at risk.

Check for `benefitsInformation.code = “5”`, which stands for Active - Pending investigation, or a response containing a `benefitsDateInformation.premiumPaidToDateEnd` before the current date. Some payers may still show active coverage while the subscriber is behind on premium payments.

You may want to conduct additional checks on these patients because they have an elevated risk of losing coverage soon.


# Check claim status
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/check-claim-status



You may need to check the status of a claim if you don't receive a 277CA or 835 ERA response from the payer within your expected timeframe. You may also want to check the status of a claim submitted by another entity. For example, a billing agency may want to check the status of a claim submitted by their customer, who is a provider.

## Claim Status API

Call one of the following endpoints to send a 276 Claim Status Request:

* [Claim Status](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status) to send requests in JSON
* [Claim Status Raw X12](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status-raw-x12) to send requests in X12 EDI

The endpoint returns a synchronous claim status response from the payer in JSON format. The response may contain information about more than one claim, if the payer has multiple claims on file that match the information you provided.

### Supply a date of services range

Supply a date range that is at least plus or minus 7 days from the date of the services listed in the claim. The payer may have stored a different date for the encounter than the one in your records, so providing a date range increases the likelihood that the payer will find a match.

We also recommend keeping the dates of service range to 30 days or less. Some payers may reject requests with a date range that is too wide.

### Don't provide too much information

Providing too much information in a claim status request can negatively affect the results. That's why we recommend first sending a base request with only the following information:

| Information               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tradingPartnerServiceId` | This is the Payer ID. Visit the [Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network) for a complete list. You can send requests using the Primary Payer ID, the Stedi Payer ID, or any alias listed in the payer record.                                                                      |
| `controlNumber`           | An integer to identify the transaction. You can set this to whatever value you prefer, and it does not need to be globally unique.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `providers`               | The provider information from the original claim. To start, provide only the `npi`, `organizationName`, and `providerType` properties.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `subscriber`              | The subscriber information from the original claim. To start, provide only the `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth` and `memberId` properties.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `encounter`               | The encounter information from the original claim status request. To start, provide only the `beginningDateOfService` and `endDateOfService` properties. Remember that you should provide a date range that is plus or minus 7 days from the date of service listed in the claim for best results. |

If this base request fails to return results, try adding in other information like `encounter.tradingPartnerClaimNumber` and `providers.taxId`.

You will eventually learn payer-specific nuances and can build logic in your system to supply additional information to specific payers. For example, some payers may have better success rates when you include the claim number.

The following examples shows a base request payload where the patient was the subscriber. It includes only the minimum recommended information:

```json
{
  "controlNumber": "222222222",
  "encounter": {
    "beginningDateOfService": "20240318",
    "endDateOfService": "20240402",
  },
  "providers": [
    {
      "npi": "1999999984",
      "organizationName": "Behavioral Services P.C.",
      "providerType": "BillingProvider",
    }
  ],
  "subscriber": {
    "dateOfBirth": "19000806",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "memberId": "111222333"
  },
  "tradingPartnerServiceId": "3429"
}
```

### Character restrictions

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

In addition, the following characters are reserved for delimiters in the final X12 EDI transaction to the payer: `~`, `*`, `:`, and `^`. X12 doesn’t support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you use these restricted characters improperly.

* **JSON endpoint:** Don’t include delimiter characters anywhere in your request data.
* **Raw X12 endpoint:** You can use these characters as delimiters, but not in the body of the request data.

### Payer limitations

Payers generally only allow a provider organization to check the status of the claims they submitted. This means that you likely won't be able to check the status of a claim submitted by a different provider organization or by the patient themselves, even if you have all of the details about the claim. Payers impose these access controls to protect plan member privacy and confidential commercial data.

Payers also often archive claims older than 18 months, but this varies by payer. If you try to check the status of a claim from several years ago, the payer may return an error even if the information you submit matches a real historical claim.

## Code lists

You may need to reference the following code lists when working with the claim status request or response.

### Claim status

Used in the `claims.claimStatus.statusCode` property. This is the status code used to identify the status of an entire claim or a service line. For example, code `20` means `Accepted for Processing`.

This is either a Health Care Claim Status Code or a National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Reject/Payment Code, when the status is related to pharmacy claims.

* Visit [Claim Status Codes](https://x12.org/codes/claim-status-codes) in the official X12 documentation for a complete list of Health Care Claim Status Codes.
* Visit the [National Council for Prescription Drug Programs website](https://www.ncpdp.org/) for access to the Reject/Payment Code list.

### Claim status category

Used in the `claims.claimStatus.statusCategoryCode` property. For example, code `F1` means `Finalized/Revised - Adjudication information has been changed`.

Visit [Claim Status Category Codes](https://x12.org/codes/claim-status-category-codes) in the official X12 documentation for a complete list.

### Product or service ID qualifier

Used in the `serviceLineInformation.productOrServiceIDQualifier` request property and the `claims.serviceDetails.service.serviceIdQualifierCode` property in the response.

<Accordion title="Product or Service ID Qualifier">
  | Code | Description                                                                            | Usage Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# Claims code lists
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/claims-code-lists



You may need to reference the following code lists when submitting professional, dental, and institutional claims and receiving claim remittances (ERAs) through the Stedi clearinghouse. Note that this page doesn't contain every code list in the claim specifications; it only contains code lists that are too long to represent clearly within the [API reference documentation](https://www.stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims).

## Adjustment Reason Codes

Returned in the 835 ERA Report `transactions.providerAdjustments.adjustments.adjustmentReasonCode` property.

* `50` - Late Charge | This is the Late Claim Filing Penalty or Medicare Late Cost Report Penalty.
* `51` - Interest Penalty Charge | This is the interest assessment for late filing.
* `72` - Authorized Return | This is the provider refund adjustment. This adjustment acknowledges a refund received from a provider for previous overpayment.
* `90` - Early Payment Allowance
* `AH` - Origination Fee | This is the claim transmission fee. This is used for transmission fees that are not specific to or dependent upon individual claims.
* `AM` - Applied to Borrower's Account | This code identifies the loan repayment amount. This is capitation specific.
* `AP` - Acceleration of Benefits | This is the accelerated payment amount or withholding. Withholding or payment identification is indicated by the sign of the amount in `providerAdjustmentAmount`. A positive value represents a withholding. A negative value represents a payment.
* `B2` - Rebate | This adjustment code applies when a provider has remitted an overpayment to a health plan in excess of the amount requested by the health plan. The amount accepted by the health plan is reported using code `72` (Authorized Return) and offset by the amount with code `WO` (Overpayment Recovery). The excess is reported as a negative amount using this code, returning the excess funds to the provider.
* `B3` - Recovery Allowance | This represents the check received from the provider for overpayments generated by payments from other payers. This code differs from the provider refund adjustment identified with code `72`.
* `BD` -  Bad Debt Adjustment | This is the bad debt passthrough.
* `BN` - Bonus | This is capitation specific.
* `C5` - Temporary Allowance | This is the tentative adjustment.
* `CR` -  Capitation Interest | This is capitation specific.
* `CS` - Adjustment | The payer should provide supporting information in `providerAdjustmentIdentifier`.
* `CT` -  Capitation Payment | This is capitation specific.
* `CV` - Capital Passthru
* `CW` - Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist Passthru
* `DM` - Direct Medical Education Passthru
* `E3` - Withholding
* `FB` -  Forwarding Balance | This is the balance forward. A negative value in `providerAdjustmentAmount` represents a balance moving forward to a future payment advice. A positive value represents a balance being applied from a previous payment advice. The payer should also supply a reference number in `providerAdjustmentIdentifier` for tracking purposes.
* `FC` -  Fund Allocation | This is capitation specific. The payer should list the specific fund in `providerAdjustmentIdentifier`.
* `GO` - Graduate Medical Education Passthru
* `HM` - Hemophilia Clotting Factor Supplement
* `IP` - Incentive Premium Payment | This is capitation specific.
* `IR` - Internal Revenue Service Withholding
* `IS` - Interim Settlement | This is the interim rate lump sum adjustment.
* `J1` - Nonreimbursable | This offsets the claim or service level data that reflects what could be paid if not for demonstration program or other limitation that prevents issuance of payment.
* `L3` -  Penalty | This is the capitation-related penalty. Withholding or release is identified by the sign in `providerAdjustmentAmount`.
* `L6` -  Interest Owed | This is the interest paid on claims in this 835.
* `LE` -  Levy | IRS Levy
* `LS` -  Lump Sum | This is the disproportionate share adjustment, indirect medical education passthrough, non-physician passthrough, passthrough lump sum adjustment, or other passthrough amount. The payer should identify the specific type of lump sum adjustment in `providerAdjustmentIdentifier`.
* `OA` -  Organ Acquisition Passthru
* `OB` - Offset for Affiliated Providers | The payer should identify affiliated providers in `providerAdjustmentIdentifier`.
* `PI` -  Periodic Interim Payment | This is the periodic interim lump sum payments and reductions (PIP). The payments are made to a provider at the beginning of some period in advance of claims. These payments are advances on the expected claims for the period. The reductions are the recovery of actual claims payments during the period. For instance, when a provider has a PIP payment, claims within this remittance advice covered by that payment would be offset using this code to remove the claim payment from the current check. The sign of the amount in `providerAdjustmentAmount` determines whether this is a payment (negative) or reduction (positive). This payment and recoupment is effectively a loan to the provider and loan repayment.
* `PL` - Payment Final | This is the final settlement.
* `RA` - Retro-activity Adjustment | This is capitation specific.
* `RE` - Return on Equity
* `SL` - Student Loan Repayment
* `TL` - Third Party Liability | This is capitation specific.
* `WO` -  Overpayment Recovery | This is the recovery of previous overpayment. The payer should provide an identifying number in `providerAdjustmentIdentifier`.
* `WU` - Unspecified Recovery | Medicare is currently using this code to represent penalty collections withheld for the IRS (an outside source).

### Choosing the right code

For some payers, the value for `claimInformation.claimFilingCode` is relatively obvious. For example, if you're submitting a claim to Medicaid California Medi-Cal, then it makes sense to default to populating `claimInformation.claimFilingCode` with `MC` (Medicaid).

For other payers, the correct code may be more difficult to determine. For example, if submitting a claim to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), you may need to submit `MA` (Medicare Part A) or `MB` (Medicare Part B).

In these cases, you can run a [real-time eligibility check](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks) and evaluate whether the response contains any information that clearly suggests which claim filing code to use. For example, if the eligibility response contains `"benefitsInformation.insuranceType" : "Commercial"` then you should submit `"claimInformation.claimFilingCode": "CI"`.

One thing to note is that you may not always get back a `benefitsInformation.insuranceType` value in an eligibility response because payers are not required to send it. In these cases, you can just submit `ZZ` as the `claimFilingCode` because the vast majority of payers will accept that value.

Once you use this workflow to determine a best guess for the Claim Filing Indicator Code for each payer, you can try sending a claim.

* **Rejection:** The rejection message will clearly state that the claim filing indicator code was incorrect, and should state which one to send instead.
* **Acceptance:** The claim filing indicator code you submitted was correct.

# CMS-1500 Claim Form PDF
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/cms-1500-claim-form-pdf



Stedi automatically generates a PDF [CMS-1500 claim form](https://www.nucc.org/index.php/1500-claim-form-mainmenu-35) for each professional claim you submit.

We strongly recommend reviewing the following behavior and recommendations if you plan to send these PDFs to payers or retain them for your records.

## Retrieve PDFs

You can manually download generated any claim's generated CMS-1500 PDF from  the transaction details page for the claim in Stedi.

You can also retrieve PDFs through either of the following endpoints:

* [CMS-1500 PDF: Business Identifier](/api-reference/healthcare/get-pdf-1500-business-identifier): Retrieve PDFs through a claim's business identifier. You can find the business identifier value in the `claimReference.correlationId` property Stedi returns in the synchronous claim submission response.
* [CMS-1500 PDF: Transaction ID
  ](/api-reference/healthcare/get-pdf-1500): Retrieve PDFs through the `transactionId` Stedi assigns to the processed claim. This ID is included in the transaction processed event for the claim, which you can receive automatically through [webhooks](/healthcare/configure-webhooks). You can also retrieve this ID from the transaction's details page in Stedi.

Both endpoints return a base64 encoded string of the CMS 1500 Claim Form PDF. To render the PDF, you must decode the base64 string and save it to a file with a `.pdf` extension.

## Generation notes

Note the following behavior and recommendations to generate optimal CMS-1500 PDFs.

### PDF background

You can generate CMS-1500 PDFs with a white background by adding the query parameter `?background=false` when calling the PDF generation endpoints.

The National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC) and CMS provide exact specifications for blank CMS-1500 forms, including paper size and ink color. Many provider offices are accustomed to using these pre-printed forms, and their Practice Management System (PMS) applications are designed to print claim data onto them. Generating PDFs with a white background allows you to print the claim data directly onto official pre-printed forms.

### The PDF may truncate claim data.

The maximum length for many fields in the 1500 claim form is less than the maximum length for the corresponding properties in the claim request.

**Recommendation:** Ensure that your claim data is within the maximum length for claim form fields. We especially recommend using [USPS abbreviations](https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28apc_002.htm) to avoid truncated addresses in the generated PDF.

### The PDF may omit the second line of some addresses.

Some 1500 claim form items contain address fields that can only be mapped to a single address line. If you include the `address2` JSON property (X12 EDI `N302`) in your claim submission, that information may not appear in the PDF.

**Recommendation:** Put all street address line data into the `address1` JSON property (X12 EDI `N301`), ensuring that you adhere to the claim form length constraints.

### The PDF won't populate Item 7 when the patient is a dependent.

Stedi validates the claim data you submit to the API and uses it to generate a compliant X12 EDI transaction to send to the payer. The PDF is generated from the final X12 EDI transaction.

The X12 EDI standard specifies that claims should only contain the insured's address when the patient is the subscriber. To maintain compliance, Stedi doesn't include the insured's address information in the generated X12 EDI transaction when the patient is a dependent, even if you provided the subscriber's address in the original API request. Since this address information isn't present in final X12 EDI claim, it's also not added to Item 7 (Insured's Address) in the generated PDF.

### Payer address (Carrier Block)

You can populate the payer's address on the PDF by providing the `payerAddress` object in your claim submission API request. Include the payer's address details that you want to appear on the form.

### Standard form size

The generated PDFs use the standard 8.5" x 11" format.

## Edit PDFs

Single-page PDFs are editable so you can make any necessary adjustments before printing and sending them to payers. You can use any PDF editor to make changes to the generated CMS-1500 PDF.

## Print PDFs

Note the following behavior and recommendations when printing CMS-1500 PDFs.

* We recommend generating PDFs with a [white background](#pdf-background) if you plan to print them on pre-printed claim forms.
* The form boxes and labels **must** be printed in red ink and the item values **must** be printed in black ink for the claim form to be read by a scanner. Your vendor may choose not to process claim forms that don't conform to these specifications.
* Set the **Page Size & Handling** option to **Actual size** or the equivalent in your PDF reader application. The **Fit** option may cause the contents to be scaled down to fit within the printable area, causing the form fields to be misaligned when printed.
* Don't print forms from the Apple Preview app built in to macOS. There appear to be problems with field alignment and fonts. Instead, we recommend using either Adobe Acrobat or Google Chrome.

### Printer models

We generally recommend using business laser printers to print CMS-1500 claim form PDFs. However, due to mechanical variations between printer models, we can't guarantee that the generated PDFs will align perfectly with pre-printed forms. You should always test the alignment with your printer before using the generated PDFs for official submissions.

You may not get acceptable results when using inkjet printer models because the file contents can extend beyond the normal printable area. If you do plan to use an inkjet printer, don't enable a **borderless** option because this may cause the printer (or printer driver) to slightly magnify the page image regardless of other print settings. This behavior can crop form edges and cause form fields to appear in the wrong positions. Some inkjet printers have a manual setting to change the extension amount, but this isn't always available and may not give consistent results.


# Interpret COB response
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/cob-response



The coordination of benefits (COB) response includes information about the patient's active health plans, subscriber information, and coordination of benefits.

Unlike standard eligibility checks, the COB response shape is standardized across all supported payers. There are no payer-specific variations in what information is included or how the response is structured.

## COB status

The `coordinationOfBenefits` object contains status information about whether a COB instance exists and whether Stedi was able to determine the primary payer.

```json
"coordinationOfBenefits": {
    "classification": "CobInstanceExistsPrimacyDetermined",
    "instanceExists": true,
    "primacyDetermined": true,
    "coverageOverlap": true,
    "benefitOverlap": true
  },
```

A COB check response can have one of the following statuses, indicated by the `coordinationOfBenefits.classification` property.

| status                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Payer primacy

The response includes a `benefitsInformation` object with `code` = `R` when Stedi finds overlapping coverage with another health plan.

The `benefitsInformation.benefitsRelatedEntities` object contains information about the other payer, and the `entityIdentifier` property indicates the payer's primacy for payment on claims when this information is available. It can be set to:

* `Payer`: Stedi didn't find a COB instance or could not determine primacy.
* `Primary Payer`: This payer is the primary payer for the service type.
* `Secondary Payer`: This payer is the secondary payer for the service type.
* `Tertiary Payer`: This payer is the tertiary payer for the service type.

In the following example, the patient has overlapping coverage for medical care services with Cigna, the primary payer for medical care services.

```json
{
      "code": "R",
      "name": "Other or Additional Payor",
      "serviceTypeCodes": [
        "1"
      ],
      "serviceTypes": [
        "Medical Care"
      ],
      "benefitsDateInformation": {
        "coordinationOfBenefits": "2024-07-01"
      },
      "benefitsRelatedEntities": [
        {
          "entityIdentifier": "Primary Payer",
          "entityName": "CIGNA",
          "entityIdentification": "PI",
          "entityIdentificationValue": "1006"
        },
        {
          "entityIdentifier": "Insured or Subscriber",
          "entityFirstname": "JOHN",
          "entityMiddlename": "X",
          "entityIdentification": "MI",
          "entityIdentificationValue": "00000000000",
          "entityLastname": "DOE"
        }
      ],
      "subscriber": {
        "dateOfBirth": "2002-12-31"
      }
    }
```

When Stedi can't reliably determine primacy, you should contact the patient's health plans directly for further guidance.

### Primacy rules

<Warning>
  Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans are not supported, so these plans aren't included in the primacy determination process.
</Warning>

Our COB service follows the guidelines set by the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)](https://content.naic.org/) to determine payer primacy. You may also want to refer to these guidelines when submitting claims.

#### Plan responsibilities

In almost all cases, the **primary** plan pays benefits first as if no other plan exists. The one exception to this policy is when the patient has both an HMO (closed network plan) and a PPO (open network plan). When the HMO is the primary plan and the PPO is secondary, the PPO will pay first when the patient uses out-of-network providers unless it's an emergency or an authorized referral covered by the HMO.

When multiple policies are treated as a single plan, the primacy determination applies to the entire plan. The plans must coordinate amongst themselves according to their contracts. If more than one insurance company provides benefits under the plan, the one designated as primary is responsible for complying with coordination of benefits rules.

#### Order of benefits rules

After the primary plan pays, each subsequent plan pays remaining eligible costs. Each health plan determines their order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply:

**1. Non-Dependent vs. Dependent vs. Medicare**

* A plan covering the patient as an employee, subscriber, or retiree is primary over a plan that covers them as a dependent.
* If the patient also has Medicare, special rules apply:
  * Medicare is secondary to a plan covering the person as a dependent.
  * Medicare is primary to a plan covering the person as an employee (from an employer with more than 20 employees), subscriber, or retiree.
  * If the patient has all three plan types, the order of primacy is: Medicare, then the plan covering the person as a dependent, and then any other plans.

**2. Dependent child with multiple plans**

Note that the following rules are the same regardless of whether the subscribers of the multiple plans are the child's parents or other significant individuals in their life (not their parents).

* If the two subscribers are married or living together: The subscriber with the birthday that occurs first in the calendar year has the primary plan. If both subscribers have the same birthday, the plan that has covered the child the longest is primary.
* If the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as their coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits will be determined using the birthday rule.
* If the two subscribers are divorced, separated, or not living together, a court order typically decides which plan is primary. Otherwise:
  * The plan of the custodial parent is primary.
  * The plan of the spouse of the custodial parent is secondary.
  * The plan of the non-custodial parent is tertiary.
  * The plan of the spouse of the non-custodial parent is last.
* If a dependent child has coverage under either or both parents' plans and is also covered as a dependent under a spouse's plan, apply rule 5 - Length of coverage.

**3. Active vs. retired employees**

Coverage from a current employer (active employee) is primary to retired or laid-off employee plans.

**4. COBRA vs. state continuation coverage**

Employer-based plans are primary to COBRA coverage.

**5. Length of coverage**

If other rules don’t decide, the plan covering the person for the longest time is primary.

**6. Final rule (If no other rules apply)**

If no clear primary plan is determined, costs are split equally between the plans.

# Sample response interpretation

The following example COB response shows information for a dependent who is covered by multiple health plans through their parents' policies. The COB check was submitted to Aetna with a service type code of `30` and a date of service of `2024-11-27`.

The response indicates the following:

* **Active coverage:** The patient has active coverage with Aetna for medical care services, pharmacy services, and vision services. This is indicated by the three objects in the `benefitsInformation` array with the `code` set to `1`.
* **Coverage overlap:** The patient has overlapping coverage for medical care services between two health plans. This is indicated by the `benefitsInformation` object with the `code` set to `R`.
* **Primacy:** The other health plan is Cigna, listed in `benefitsInformation.benefitsRelatedEntities`. Cigna is the primary payer for medical care services.
* **COB instance:** There is a COB instance for medical care services on the date of service provided in the request. This is indicated in the `coordinationOfBenefits` object.

Based on this response, you must send claims first to Cigna as the primary payer for medical care services. Once Cigna adjudicates the claim, you can send another one, if necessary, to Aetna as the secondary payer (subject to specific payer claims processing rules).

Before sending claims we'd also recommend sending a separate eligibility check to Aetna to verify coverage status.

## Request and response examples

The following examples show request and response data for common COB scenarios.

### COB exists, primacy determined

In the following example, the COB check was submitted to Cigna with a service type code of `30` and a date of service of `2024-12-19`.

The response indicates that the patient has active coverage with Cigna for medical care services, and that there is overlapping coverage with Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Massachusetts. COB is required for medical care services, and Kaiser is the primary payer.

### Coverage overlap, no benefit overlap

In the following example, the COB check was submitted to Cigna with a service type code of `30` and a date of service of `2025-01-01`.

The response indicates that the patient has active coverage with Cigna for medical care services, and that there is overlapping coverage with Aetna for dental care services. There is no benefit overlap between the two health plans because dental and medical benefits have two different service type codes. COB is not required.

## Follow up with eligibility checks

Our COB data is updated weekly, and the response doesn't contain complete details about the patient's coverage with each health plan.

When Stedi finds overlapping coverage, we strongly recommend conducting follow-up [eligibility checks](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks) with each payer to verify coverage status and retrieve the patient's complete, up-to-date benefits information.


# COB troubleshooting
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/cob-troubleshooting



A list of potential errors and possible resolutions when submitting coordination of benefits (COB) checks.

## Inaccurate patient data

COB checks are significantly more sensitive to data accuracy than eligibility checks. To perform successful COB checks, the patient information you provide in the check **must** match the payer's data exactly.

For example, if a payer has a patient's name stored as "Jonathan Doe", they may return benefits information when you submit an eligibility check for "Jon Doe", as long as they can identify the patient through the other information provided. However, a COB request for "Jon Doe" will fail because the name doesn't match the payer's records exactly.

To avoid unnecessary COB check failures, we strongly recommend that you first submit an eligibility check request for the patient. Then use the following data from the successful payer benefit response to build the COB request: `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth`, `memberId`.

## Invalid or unsupported payer ID

COB requests require a valid payer ID in the `tradingPartnerServiceId` property. Visit the Stedi [Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network?query=eyIyNzAiOnt9LCIyNzYiOnt9LCI4MzUiOnt9LCI4MzdQIjp7fSwiODM3SSI6e30sIjgzN0QiOnt9LCJDT0IiOnsiaXNTdXBwb3J0ZWQiOnRydWV9fQ%3D%3D\&page=0) for a complete list of supported payers and their payer IDs.

You should also ensure that you're sending the request to the correct payer entity. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) has multiple entities that operate in different states. If you send a request to the wrong entity, the request will fail with an `AAA` = `75` error (Subscriber/Insured Not Found).

## Missing data

COB requests must contain the patient’s `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth`, plus `memberId` and/or `ssn`. If you do not send all data points, Stedi returns an HTTP `400` error with a message listing the missing data.

```json
{
  "fieldList": [
    {
      "path": "/subscriber/dateOfBirth",
      "message": "Value at '/subscriber/dateOfBirth' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must not be null"
    }
  ],
  "message": "1 validation error detected. Value at '/subscriber/dateOfBirth' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must not be null"
}
```

## Request found multiple patients

This error can occur when Stedi finds more than one member ID for the patient in the request. For example, this could occur if you only provide the patient's social security number, and the search returns more than one member ID associated with that social security number.

In this case, Stedi returns a HTTP `200` response with an `AAA` error in the `subscriber` object.

```json
"subscriber": {
  "memberId": "123456789",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "dateOfBirth": "1961-10-21",
  "aaaErrors": [
      {
        "field": "AAA",
        "code": "76",
        "description": "Duplicate Subscriber/Insured ID Number",
        "followupAction": "Please Correct and Resubmit",
        "location": "Loop 2100C",
        "possibleResolutions": "Duplicate member ID was found in the payer database."
      }
    ]
}
```

## Member not found

If Stedi cannot find a member ID for the patient in the request, it returns an HTTP `200` response with an `AAA` error in the `subscriber` object.

```json
"subscriber": {
  "memberId": "123456789",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "dateOfBirth": "1961-10-21",
    "aaaErrors": [
      {
        "field": "AAA",
        "code": "75",
        "description": "Subscriber/Insured Not Found",
        "followupAction": "Please Correct and Resubmit",
        "location": "Loop 2100C",
        "possibleResolutions": "- Subscriber was not found."
      }
    ]
}
```

Mismatches in the `memberId` are one of the most common causes of Member Not Found errors. We strongly recommend first performing an Eligibility Check and using the `memberId` in the response to populate your COB check.

You will also receive a Member Not Found error if you try to submit a COB request to a Medicare or Medicare Advantage plan. These plans aren't supported for COB checks.

## Invalid service dates

The service dates you provide **must** be within the past 2 years. COB checks don't support requests with dates outside of this range.

Don't send service dates that are in the future. Future service dates typically result in errors from the payer.

## Inactive coverage

For COB checks to return a positive result, the patient must have active coverage. Sometimes, you can receive a false negative or error on a COB check when a patient's coverage has very recently changed. For example, if the patient recently became eligible for coverage within the last few days, that information may not yet be reflected in the COB member data, and you will receive a Member Not Found error.

Payers typically update COB member data on a weekly basis. If you receive an error and the patient's coverage has recently changed, we recommend trying again next week to give the changes time to propagate to the COB database.

## AAA errors

The COB response may contain one or more `AAA` errors specify issues with your request and any recommended follow-up actions. Stedi includes this information in the `aaaErrors` object in the response JSON.

`AAA` errors can be present at multiple different levels in the response, depending on the type. In the COB response, the `subscriber`, `dependent`, and `provider` objects can each contain their own `aaaErrors` array.

Common causes for AAA errors include:

* Missing or incorrect information for the subscriber, dependent, provider, or payer. In this case, you should correct any errors before resubmitting.
* Issues with payer enrollment. Many of these issues require that the provider contact the payer directly to resolve, due to PHI/HIPAA guidelines.

Each error contains a code field that corresponds to a `followupAction`:

* `C` - Please correct and resubmit
* `N` - Resubmission not allowed
* `P` - Please resubmit original transaction
* `R` - Resubmission allowed
* `S` - Do not resubmit; Inquire initiated to a third party
* `Y` - Do not resubmit; We will hold your request and respond again shortly


# Configure webhooks
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/configure-webhooks



You can set up webhooks that automatically send claim processing events to your endpoint.

These events contain the information you need to retrieve 277 Claim Acknowledgment (277CA) and 835 Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) responses through Stedi's APIs. They can also help you monitor your claims pipeline when you're submitting claims through [Stedi SFTP](/healthcare/submit-claims-sftp-connection).

You can either create a single webhook that forwards events from all transactions, or create a separate webhook for each transaction type.

Configuring a webhook involves:

* Creating a [credential set](#credential-set) for authentication to the endpoint.
* Creating a [webhook](#webhook) that specifies the URL where Stedi should deliver events.
* Adding one or more [event bindings](#event-bindings) that trigger the webhook.

## Credential set

A credential set defines how to authenticate with a specific API. You can use a single credential set across multiple webhooks. Stedi supports the following types of configurations.

| Type       | Description                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Keys   | The API keys as headers in the request. The most common version is ‘bearer tokens’.                                        |
| Basic Auth | [HTTP Basic Auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Authentication), where you provide a username and password. |
| None       | For endpoints that don't require any authentication.                                                                       |

### Unauthenticated endpoints

When using the 'None' credential set type in webhooks, it's functionally the same as using 'API Keys'. However, we set a dummy value for `Header name` and `Value` (`x-stedi-noauth` and `dummy`). Since the receiving API isn't authenticating the call, it will ignore these values and accept the request.

### Create credential set

You can define a credential set as part of configuring a new webhook. You can also create a new credential set independently and then attach it to one or more webhooks.

To create a credential set:

1. Go to the [Webhooks](https://portal.stedi.com/app/webhooks) page.
2. Click **Manage credentials**, and then click **Create credential set**.
3. Enter a name.
4. Choose the appropriate **Authentication type**.
5. Enter the details.
6. Click **Create credential set**.

## Webhook

A webhook defines which URL endpoint Stedi should call when the webhook is invoked, and which HTTP method to use (`POST`, `PUT`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).

You can only attach one credential set to each webhook. However, you might have multiple webhooks for a single system integration, each with a different endpoint.

### Create webhook

To create a new webhook:

1. Go to the [Webhooks](https://portal.stedi.com/app/webhooks) page.
2. Click **Create webhook**.
3. Enter a name.
4. Choose a **Method** and enter an **Endpoint** URL. This is where Stedi delivers the events when the webhook is invoked.
5. Select a **Credential set** to use for authentication or create a new one for this endpoint.
6. (Optional) Set the **Concurrency**. You can set the maximum number of deliveries that Stedi will attempt to deliver to the endpoint at one time. This can help you avoid overloading the target service.

## Event bindings

Event bindings allow you to specify which events trigger the webhook. You can create multiple event bindings for a single webhook. For example, you may want to create an event binding for each type of transaction you want to send to your API.

### Create event binding

To create a new event binding:

1. Go to the [Webhooks](https://portal.stedi.com/app/webhooks) page.
2. Click the webhook.
3. Click the **Event bindings** tab.
4. Click **New event binding**.
5. Choose **Transaction processed** as the **Event type**.
6. (Optional) Set one or more [filters](#event-filters).
7. Click **Create binding**.

### Choosing event types

The recommended event bindings depend on your use case:

* **API claim submission:** At a minimum, you should create an event binding for transaction processed events because they contain the information you need to retrieve claim responses from Stedi. You may also want to set up event bindings for file delivered and file failed events.
* **SFTP claim submission:** At a minimum, you should create an event binding for file failed events because they're emitted when Stedi is unable to deliver your claim to the payer. You may also want to set up event bindings for file delivered events and transaction processed events.

<Note>
  The file processed and fragment processed events are not relevant to claims
  processing.
</Note>

**Transaction processed events**

Stedi emits a transaction processed event after it successfully receives and translates a payer or intermediary clearinghouse response into JSON. The event payload contains the information you need to retrieve processed responses through Stedi's APIs:

* `x12.transactionSetIdentifier` specifies the transaction type (277 or 835).
* `transactionId` allows you to retrieve the transaction from Stedi using either the [277CA Report](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-277) or [835 ERA Report](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835) endpoint.

Even if you plan to retrieve claim responses through Stedi SFTP, you may want to monitor these events so you can receive alerts when new claim responses are available.

**File delivered events**

Stedi emits a file delivered event when it successfully generates and delivers a claim. You may want to send these events to your system for monitoring and alerting.

Note that this event is emitted when Stedi delivers your claim to our connection with the payer. It doesn't indicate whether the payer received the claim or whether they have accepted or rejected it.

**File failed events**

Stedi emits a file failed event when it either fails to process a response from a payer or cannot deliver a submitted claim.

If you're submitting claims through Stedi's SFTP connection, we strongly recommend monitoring these events so that you can receive instant notifications when a submitted claim fails due to validation errors in the EDI file.

File failed events can indicate connection problems or other issues that our engineering team must resolve with the payer. If you're submitting claims through Stedi's APIs, you may want to also monitor these events so you can alert our customer support team if needed.

### Event filters

You may want to further filter the events Stedi sends to your endpoint:

* **Transaction:** This is useful if you want to send events for 277 Claim Acknowledgments to one endpoint and events for 835 ERAs (claim payments) to another. For example, if you set this to `277: Health Care Information Status Notification`, Stedi only sends events for processed 277s to your endpoint.
* **Partnership:** This is useful if you want to send test claims to one endpoint and production claims to another. For example, if you set this to `local-clearinghouse-test`, Stedi only sends events for test claims to your endpoint.

<Note>
  The **Guide**, **Connection**, and **Mode** filters are not relevant to claims
  processing.
</Note>

## HTTP response codes

Stedi considers a 2xx response a success, and marks any other response as a failure.

Stedi retries events associated with status codes other than `2xx` for up to 4 times with a 90 second wait period inbetween retries.

If the maximum number of retries has been exhausted, Stedi adds the event to the [error queue](#error-queue) for the webhook.

You can set the **Concurrency** when configuring the webhook to prevent throttling. This setting determines the maximum number of deliveries that Stedi will attempt to deliver to the endpoint at one time.

## Response time

The target endpoint must respond within 5 seconds, or the event will be counted as a failed delivery.

## Retries

When a delivery fails, Stedi will retry up to 4 times every 90 seconds. After the fifth retry, Stedi moves the event to the error queue.

### Duplicate deliveries

If your webook doesn't respond within 5 seconds, Stedi marks that as a failure and then automatically retries. This can result in duplicate deliveries, so we **strongly recommend** implementing ways to manage duplicates delivered through webhooks.

## Error queue

Each webhook includes an error queue. Each item in the queue consists of the original event that was attempted to be delivered. This ensures if the target service has some downtime, or anything else goes wrong, the missed events can be retried later. The error queue retains items for 14 days.

The order of the error queue is not guaranteed. The downstream service must be designed to be idempotent to handle at-least-once delivery of events, and must accept events out of order.

## Logs

To view logs, click the webhook to go to its detail page, and then navigate to the **Logs** tab.

## Deauthorized connections

If a webhook sends a message to an endpoint that returns a 401 (Unauthorized) response, the destination will be 'deauthorized'. In this state, the webhook won't be able to deliver messages.

If there is an issue with your authentication information (such as the password, API key, or OAuth settings), edit the webhook to fix it.

If the authentication information is correct, and there was a different reason for the endpoint returning a 401, you can try again by adding a temporary header. For example, `x-stedi-reauthorize` with today's date as a value. When you save, the webhook will attempt to deliver again. This header can be removed later. Editing the value of a header will also restart deliveries.

You will likely have a queue of messages to deliver, so Stedi will automatically start retrying them after you make this change. If the endpoint is still returning an invalid response, the webhook will return to `Deauthorized`.


# Coordination of benefits (COB) checks
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/coordination-of-benefits



Some patients have multiple health plans. For example, a dependent may have coverage with two private insurance companies through their parents. When a patient has active coverage with multiple plans, you need to know which health plan is primarily responsible for paying claims (coordination of benefits).

You can use a coordination of benefits (COB) check to determine:

* If a patient is covered by more than one health plan
* Whether there is coverage overlap between plans
* Whether coverage overlap requires coordination of benefits
* Each payer's responsibility for payment (primacy) in coordination of benefits scenarios

COB checks can help ensure that you submit claims to the correct payer and avoid claim denials. We recommend performing coordination of benefits checks for all new patients who have coverage through one of Stedi's supported payers.

Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans are not supported; visit the [Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network?query=eyIyNzAiOnt9LCIyNzYiOnt9LCI4MzUiOnt9LCI4MzdQIjp7fSwiODM3SSI6e30sIjgzN0QiOnt9LCJDT0IiOnsiaXNTdXBwb3J0ZWQiOnRydWV9fQ%3D%3D\&page=0) for a complete list of supported payers.

<Tip>
  COB checks require that you know at least one of the patient's active health
  plans. If you're unsure whether a patient has any active coverage at all, you
  can perform an [insurance discovery check](/healthcare/insurance-discovery) to
  find potential coverage.
</Tip>

## How COB checks work

You submit a coordination of benefits request with information for one of the patient's health plans. The information required is similar to a standard eligibility check – first name, last name, DOB, and either member ID or SSN – and you should first run a [real-time eligibility check](https://www.stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) to ensure that the member’s details are accurate.

Once you submit the request, Stedi searches a database of eligibility data from regional and national plans. This database has 245+ million patient coverage records from 45+ health plans, ASOs, TPAs, and others, including participation from the vast majority of national commercial health plans. Data is updated at least weekly to ensure accuracy.

Stedi synchronously returns summary information about each of the patient’s active health plans, whether there is coverage overlap, and, if so, the responsibility sequence number for each payer (such as primary or secondary, if that can be determined).

Once you receive the results, you should send real-time eligibility checks to each additional payer to verify coverage and view the full details of the patient’s plan before submitting claims.

## Check COB

Each COB check must be for a participating health plan for which the patient has coverage. For example, if the patient has coverage from Cigna and UnitedHealthcare, a COB check to Aetna will return an error. Also note that Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans are not supported.

### COB API

Use the [Coordination of Benefits Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-coordination-of-benefits) endpoint to submit COB checks programmatically.

### UI form

To prevent accidentally sending checks to unsupported payers, the Stedi portal only provides the option to perform a COB check within successful eligibility checks to supported COB payers.

To submit a new COB check through the Stedi portal:

1. Go to the [Eligibility searches](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/eligibility) page.
2. Click the eligibility check for the patient you want to check for coordination of benefits. This must be a successful eligibility check for the patient's health plan - failed checks can't be used as the basis for COB checks.
3. Click **View** to review the details of the eligibility check.
4. Click `New COB check` to open the coordination of benefits check form. Stedi prefills the patient's information from the eligibility check.

### Accurate patient data

COB checks are significantly more sensitive to data accuracy than eligibility checks. To perform successful COB checks, the patient information you provide in the check **must** match the payer's data exactly.

For example, if a payer has a patient's name stored as "Jonathan Doe", they may return benefits information when you submit an eligibility check for "Jon Doe", as long as they can identify the patient through the other information provided. However, a COB request for "Jon Doe" will fail because the name doesn't match the payer's records exactly.

To avoid unnecessary COB check failures, we strongly recommend that you first submit an eligibility check request for the patient. Then use the following data from the successful payer benefit response to build the COB request: `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth`, `memberId`.

### Service type code

You can submit COB checks with the `30` service type code for Health Benefit Plan Coverage. This is the broadest service type code that covers all medical services and subtypes included in the patient's health plan.


# Active coverage
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/eligibility-active-coverage-benefits



After you send a successful eligibility or insurance discovery check, the payer sends back an X12 271 Eligibility Benefit Response containing the patient’s benefits information. Stedi transforms the 271 response from the original X12 EDI into JSON, making it easier to read, understand, and ingest into your system.

You can find the full benefits response shape in the [Real-Time Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) and [Insurance Discovery Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-insurance-discovery) API references. This documentation describes how to use the benefits response to determine the patient's active coverage, plan details, and specific benefits.

## When is the patient eligible for benefits?

The `planDateInformation` object contains dates related to the patient's coverage under their health plan. Most commercial payers only return information for the current calendar year.

You can use these dates to determine the patient's eligibility for benefits.

* The dates in `planDateInformation` apply to every benefit within the patient's health plan unless specifically overridden within a `benefitsInformation.benefitsDateInformation` object. Visit [Benefit-specific eligibility dates](#benefit-specific-eligibility-dates) for more details.
* The patient likely doesn't have active coverage if the date of service is after the earliest ending `plan`, `eligibility` `planEnd`, `eligibilityEnd`, `policyEffective`, or `policyExpiration` value.

The following example shows part of the benefits response for a health plan that began on January 1, 2024 and ended on December 31, 2024. The patient was eligible for benefits under that health plan starting on January 2, 2024.

```json
"planDateInformation": {
    "planBegin": "20240101",
    "planEnd": "20241231",
    "eligibilityBegin": "20240102"
  }
```

### Plan dates for dependents

Dependents can have different coverage dates than the subscriber due to qualifying life events, such as starting a new job or passing the age limit for coverage through their parent's plan.

When the patient is a dependent, and the payer sends back date(s) that are different for the subscriber and dependent, Stedi includes only the dates for the dependent and omits the subscriber's date(s).

## What are the patient's benefits?

The vast majority of the information you need to determine a patient's benefits under their health plan is contained in the `benefitsInformation` array. Each object in this array contains information about a specific benefit type, such as co-payments, deductibles, and exclusions.

The `benefitsInformation.code` property indicates the type of benefits information described in the `benefitsInformation` object. Sometimes, the code simply indicates that the patient has active coverage for the `serviceTypes` listed. For example, the following excerpt shows a member with active coverage for service type code `30` (Health Benefit Plan Coverage).

```json
{
  "code": "1",
  "name": "Active Coverage",
  "serviceTypeCodes": [
     "30"
  ],
  "serviceTypes": [
     "Health Benefit Plan Coverage"
  ],
  "planCoverage": "Open Access Plus",
  "additionalInformation": [
     {
       "description": "Complete Care Management"
    }
  ]
}
```

In other array entries, the code indicates that the `benefitsInformation` object contains details about specific benefits, such as co-payments, deductibles, and exclusions.

The following example shows a patient's co-payment for psychiatric, psychotherapy, and social work in-office visits.

* The copayment is \$20 for providers considered in-network, as indicated by the `Y` in the `inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode` property.
* Note that the `inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode` doesn't tell you whether the provider that requested the eligibility check is in-network for the health plan, so you shouldn't assume a \$20 copay for that provider until you can verify that they are in-network. Visit [Provider network status, authorizations, referrals](/healthcare/eligibility-network-status-authorization-referrals) for more details about verifying a provider's network status.

```json
{
  "code": "B",
  "name": "Co-Payment",
  "coverageLevelCode": "IND",
  "coverageLevel": "Individual",
  "serviceTypeCodes": ["A4", "A6", "22"],
  "serviceTypes": ["Psychiatric", "Psychotherapy", "Social Work"],
  "timeQualifierCode": "27",
  "timeQualifier": "Visit",
  "benefitAmount": "20",
  "authOrCertIndicator": "N",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode": "Y",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicator": "Yes",
  "eligibilityAdditionalInformation": {
    "codeListQualifierCode": "Mutually Defined",
    "industryCode": "Office"
  },
  "eligibilityAdditionalInformationList": [
    {
      "codeListQualifierCode": "Mutually Defined",
      "industryCode": "Office"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefit type codes

The following is a complete list of codes that can be returned in the `benefitsInformation.code` property.

* `1` - Active Coverage
* `2` - Active - Full Risk Capitation
* `3` - Active - Services Capitated
* `4` - Active - Services Capitated to Primary Care Physician
* `5` - Active - Pending Investigation
* `6` - Inactive
* `7` - Inactive - Pending Eligibility Update
* `8` - Inactive - Pending Investigation
* `A` - [Co-Insurance](/healthcare/eligibility-patient-responsibility-benefits#co-insurance)
* `B` - [Co-Payment](/healthcare/eligibility-patient-responsibility-benefits#co-payment)
* `C` - [Deductible](/healthcare/eligibility-patient-responsibility-benefits#deductible)
* `CB` - Coverage Basis
* `D` - Benefit Description
* `E` - Exclusions
* `F` - Limitations
* `G` - [Out of Pocket (Stop Loss)](/healthcare/eligibility-patient-responsibility-benefits#out-of-pocket-stop-loss)
* `H` - Unlimited
* `I` - Non-Covered
* `J` - [Cost Containment](/healthcare/eligibility-patient-responsibility-benefits#cost-containment)
* `K` - Reserve
* `L` - Primary Care Provider
* `M` - Pre-existing Condition
* `MC` - Managed Care Coordinator
* `N` - Services Restricted to Following Provider
* `O` - Not Deemed a Medical Necessity
* `P` - Benefit Disclaimer
* `Q` - Second Surgical Opinion Required
* `R` - Other or Additional Payor
* `S` - Prior Year(s) History
* `T` - Card(s) Reported Lost/Stolen | Typically used by Medicaid to indicate to a provider that the person who has presented the ID card is using a stolen ID card.
* `U` - Contact Following Entity for Eligibility or Benefit Information
* `V` - Cannot Process
* `W` - Other Source of Data
* `X` - Health Care Facility
* `Y` - [Spend Down](/healthcare/eligibility-patient-responsibility-benefits#spend-down)

#### Code `V` - Cannot Process

These are the most common reasons a payer may return a `benefitsInformation.code` of `V`:

* **Request errors:** The payer didn't actually return any benefits information because of errors in the request - listed in the `errors` object. You should ignore the stub benefits data in the `benefitsInformation` object, correct the errors, and resubmit the eligibility check.
* **Wrong submission method:** The payer doesn't support automated X12 EDI eligibility checks for the service type code you provided and requires that you obtain benefits information through a different channel, such as by phone or online portal. The `benefitsInformation.additionalInformation.description` typically contains an explanation. The payer may also include contact information in `payer.contactInformation`.
* **Unable to interpret:** The payer located the member but couldn't make sense of the request. For example, a dental payer can't return benefits information for a vision service type code.
* **Alternate service type code:** The payer has grouped the service type code you submitted into a different one. In this case, the payer typically returns a `benefitsInformation` entry with `code` = `V` immediately followed by an entry with an active code and `benefitsInformation.serviceTypeCodes` set to the preferred service type code.

### Active and inactive coverage

You can quickly determine whether a patient has active coverage for specific service types when the `benefitsInformation.code` is set to `1` (Active Coverage). The following example shows a member with active coverage for service type code `30` (Health Benefit Plan Coverage).

```json
{
  "code": "1",
  "name": "Active Coverage",
  "serviceTypeCodes": [
    "30"
  ],
  "serviceTypes": [
    "Health Benefit Plan Coverage"
  ],
  "insuranceTypeCode": "C1",
  "insuranceType": "Commercial",
  "planCoverage": "Gold Plan HMO",
  "authOrCertIndicator": "Y",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode": "W",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicator": "Not Applicable",
  "benefitsRelatedEntity": {
    "entityIdentifier": "Payer",
    "entityType": "Non-Person Entity",
    "entityName": "UNITEDHEALTHCARE",
    "entityIdentification": "PI",
    "entityIdentificationValue": "87726"
  }
}
```

Likewise, you can quickly determine when a patient has inactive coverage for a service type when the `benefitsInformation.code` is set to `6` (Inactive). The following example shows a member with inactive coverage for service type code `30` (Health Plan Benefit Coverage).

```json
{
  "code": "6",
  "name": "Inactive",
  "serviceTypeCodes": [
    "30"
  ],
  "serviceTypes": [
     "Health Benefit Plan Coverage"
  ],
  "inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode": "W",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicator": "Not Applicable"
}
```

### Benefit-specific eligibility dates

When present, the `benefitsInformation.benefitsDateInformation` object contains dates that determine the patient's eligibility for a specific type of benefits. You should use these dates to determine the patient's eligibility for that specific benefit type instead of the dates in the `planDateInformation` object.

Payers send benefit-specific dates when certain benefits within a plan have different activation rules or waiting periods than the overall plan coverage. This can happen in a variety of scenarios, including:

* Employers may offer plans with benefits that activate based on employment duration or role. For example, Medical coverage may start on your hire date, but life insurance or disability coverage begins after 90 days.
* Some plans require a delay before certain benefits start, even though your general plan is active. For example, dental insurance may have a 6-month waiting period for major services (like crowns), but basic services (like cleanings) are covered immediately.
* Some government programs like Medicare split coverage (Part A, B, D, etc.), each with its own effective date.
* You may switch plans during open enrollment, and new benefits might have different effective dates.

## What's the plan name?

The only standard property that contains a health plan product or program name is `benefitsInformation.planCoverage`. However, payers are only required to provide this information for service type code (STC) `30`. They may provide it for other STCs, but they don't have to.

The `benefitsInformation` array can contain many entries for multiple plans, such as medical, dental, and vision. You may want to filter `benefitsInformation` objects for certain STCs before checking for the plan name.

In the following example, the plan name is `Open Access Plus`:

```json
{
  "code": "1",
  "name": "Active Coverage",
  "serviceTypeCodes": [
    "30"
  ],
  "serviceTypes": [
    "Health Benefit Plan Coverage"
  ],
  "planCoverage": "Open Access Plus",
  "additionalInformation": [
    {
      "description": "Complete Care Management"
    }
  ]
}
```

You may also be able to identify the plan name through the following properties, but they're not as reliable as `planCoverage.` Payers aren't required to return information for these properties, so behavior can vary by payer or even by plan.

* Some properties may contain a name for the group (often named for the employer if they sponsor the plan), insurance policy, or network. These properties are: `groupDescription`, `planDescription`, and `planNetworkIdDescription`. These properties may be included in the `subscriber`, `dependents`, or `benefitsInformation.benefitsAdditionalInformation` objects, depending on where the payer places this information in the benefit response.
* Some payers may send something like a plan name in `planInformation.planDescription` or as unstructured text in `benefitsInformation.additionalInformation.description`.

# Eligibility Manager
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/eligibility-manager



<Warning>
  Eligibility Manager is a **beta** feature. Data may be periodically removed during active development.
</Warning>

Eligibility Manager provides insight into your eligibility check pipeline and helps you identify, diagnose, and fix failed eligibility checks. For example, you can filter for all of the eligibility checks that failed during a payer outage and retry once the payer is back online.

In the app, you can:

* Review every eligibility check you submit through the app or Stedi's APIs.
* Search and filter historical eligibility checks by status, Payer ID, date, and error code.
* Edit and retry failed eligibility checks and review the details of each attempt.
* Use the Debug view to systematically troubleshoot failed eligibility checks until you receive a successful response from the payer.

## Example troubleshooting workflow

The following example shows how Eligibility Manager can help you track and resolve eligibility check failures:

<Steps>
  <Step title="New eligibility check">
    You submit an eligibility check through Stedi's [Eligibility Check API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) for Nick Smith. Stedi assigns a unique Eligibility Search ID to the request and sends it to the payer. Stedi also creates a new eligibility search record in the app containing the request details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initial failure - Subscriber not found">
    The payer returns an [AAA error](/healthcare/eligibility-troubleshooting#payer-aaa-errors) code `75` - Subscriber/Insured Not Found. Eligibility Manager shows that the status for the new eligibility search is `Failed`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit and retry">
    You open the eligibility search, diagnose the error, correct the subscriber's first name to "Nicholas", and submit the updated eligibility check. Stedi assigns the same Eligibility Search ID to the retry request and stores the updated request as another entry in the existing eligibility search.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Success - Active coverage">
    The payer returns a successful response showing active insurance coverage for Nicholas Smith. The status of the Eligibility Search changes to `Active`, and you can view the request and response details for both iterations of the eligibility check - the original failure and the successful retry - within the same eligibility search record.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Eligibility search

Eligibility Manager stores eligibility check requests in groups called eligibility searches. An eligibility search is a chronological record of every eligibility check submitted with the same **Eligibility Search ID**.

When you submit an eligibility check through the app or API, Stedi creates a new eligibility search record based on the Eligibility Search ID assigned to the request. Every time you retry that eligibility check with the same Eligibility Search ID, Stedi stores the retry  details within the existing eligibility search. This creates a clear timeline of troubleshooting efforts for failed requests.

### Create

You can create a new eligibility search through the app or Stedi's APIs.

* **App:** Click **New search** and enter the eligibility check details into the interactive form.
* **API:** Use the [Eligibility Check API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) to submit an eligibility check programmatically.

For both methods, you can either set a unique **Eligibility Search ID** for the request, or Stedi can automatically assign one for you. Once you submit the eligibility check, Stedi creates a new eligibility search in the app.

#### External Patient ID

You can optionally add a **External Patient ID** to the request. This should be a unique identifier for the patient in your system. Adding this identifier helps you identify eligibility checks for the same patient over time.

### Filter

You can filter eligibility searches by the following criteria:

* **Error code:** By the [AAA code](/healthcare/eligibility-troubleshooting#payer-aaa-errors) returned by the payer. For example, `42` errors indicate a connectivity issue.
* **Payer:** By the Payer ID (62308) or business name (such as Cigna)
* **Status:** By Queued, Started, Failed, Inactive, and Active
* **Date:** A date range for when the initial eligibility check within an eligibility search was submitted. For example, a filter beginning on October 1st would only include eligibility searches with an initial submission on or after October 1st. It would *not* include an eligibility search with an initial submission on September 30th and a retry on October 1st.
* **Available actions:** Immediately find all eligibility searches that are eligible to edit and retry (errors in the request data) or retry without edits (error codes `42` and `80`, which indicate payer connectivity issues).

Results are sorted by the date of the original eligibility check within the eligibility search, with the most recent listed first.

### Statuses

The status of an eligibility search is determined by the most recent eligibility check in the record. For example, if the most recent iteration of a check failed, the status of the entire eligibility search is `Failed`, even if a previous version of the request succeeded.

An eligibility search can have one of the following statuses:

* **Queued:** Stedi placed the eligibility check in its internal queue and will send it to the payer when resources are available. This status is common when you schedule batch eligibility check refreshes through the API or perform large bulk retries that exceed your account's concurrency budget. You can typically expect the status to change to `Started` within a few seconds.
* **Started:** Stedi sent your eligibility check to the payer and is waiting for a response.
* **Failed:** The payer returned an error code in the response. Review the error code and retry the eligibility check.
* **Inactive:** The payer's response doesn't contain an active eligibility and benefit type.
* **Active:** The payer's response contains an active eligibility and benefit type (codes 1-5). Visit [Eligibility and benefit type codes](/healthcare/eligibility-active-coverage-benefits#benefit-type-codes) for a complete list.

## Retry failed eligibility checks

Eligibility Manager allows you to edit the request details and retry  eligibility checks until you get a successful response. You can choose to retry the entire eligibility search (the most recent iteration of the eligibility check) or select a specific iteration to retry.

To resubmit an eligibility check, click an eligibility search to review its details and then click **Edit and retry**.

Stedi opens a submission form prepopulated with the request details from the iteration you selected. You can update the patient information, service type codes, and other properties as needed, and then click **Submit** to retry the eligibility check.

You'll know the retry was successful when the status of the eligibility search is either `Active` or `Inactive`. Once a retry is successful, you can view the raw request data for the successful check and use it to make a call to Stedi's [Eligibility Check API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility).

### Debug view

Click **Debug** within an eligibility search to enter a workspace where you can systematically troubleshoot failed eligibility checks until you receive a successful response from the payer. For example, first you might try swapping the patient's nickname (Dave) for their full name (David) to see if that returns benefits information. In the next iteration, you might try submitting the request with a different service type code or dropping the date of birth.

Debug view shows all past iterations of the eligibility check and highlights the differences between each new version of the request. You can also draft and submit new requests directly from this page. This format helps you understand what you've already tried and quickly iterate on failed requests.

### Batch retry

Error codes `42` and `80` indicate that an eligibility check failed because of a connectivity issue between Stedi and the payer. Common causes include payer outages, payer throttling, and that the transaction timed out. Visit [Eligibility troubleshooting](/healthcare/eligibility-troubleshooting#errors) for complete details.

You can filter for all eligibility searches with error codes `42` and `80` by selecting **Available actions: Retry**. Then, you can perform a batch retry for up to 50 failed requests at a time. This action automatically resubmits the most recent eligibility check within each eligibility search.

This approach is useful when you need to retry multiple eligibility checks that failed during a payer outage.


# Provider network status, authorizations, referrals
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/eligibility-network-status-authorization-referrals



You have a few options for determining whether the requesting provider is in- or out-of-network for the patient. The most reliable method is contacting the payer or provider directly.

You can also use the `benefitsInformation` objects in the eligibility response to determine whether prior authorization or a referral is required for requested services.

## Is the provider in- or out-of-network?

Unfortunately, you can't reliably answer this question from a standard eligibility check response.

Payers typically don't explicitly indicate whether the requesting provider is in- or out-of-network for the patient (though there are some [exceptions](#additional-network-status-details)). You also can't use the [`inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode` property](#in-plan-network-indicator) for this purpose. The `inPlanNetworkIndictorCode` indicates whether the specific benefit type applies to in- versus out-of-network, not the requesting provider.

The most reliable way to determine network status is to check directly with the payer or the provider. Note that payers may have different networks for different health plans, such as employer-sponsored plans versus Medicare Advantage, and these networks may have different contact paths.

### Payer FHIR APIs

Some payers have implemented the HL7 Da Vinci PDEX Plan Net (FHIR) API, which allows you to query directly for provider network status. Here are links to these APIs for a few large, commercial payers:

* [Aetna](https://developerportal.aetna.com/welcome)
* [Cigna](https://developer.cigna.com/docs/service-apis)
* [Humana](https://developers.humana.com/provider-directory-api/doc)
* [UnitedHealthcare](https://www.uhc.com/legal/interoperability-apis)

This is not an exhaustive list, and we provide these links for convenience and reference only. Stedi can't give any additional support on how to use third-party APIs.

### Additional network status details

Some payers do provide additional information about whether the requesting provider is in- or out-of-network. They may do this through either selective inclusion of benefits in the response or through freeform messages.

#### Selective inclusion of benefits

A small subset of payers selectively include portions of the eligibility response according to the provider’s network status. For example, some payers only return out-of-network benefits if the requesting provider is out-of-network. Likewise, if the provider is in-network, they only provide in-network benefits.

One example is Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico (BCBSNM). Their [270/271 Transaction Standard Companion Guide](https://www.bcbsnm.com/docs/provider/nm/nm_eligibility_benefits_270_271.pdf) states in section 5.3:

> "When local transactions are submitted, BCBSNM uses the provider type and/or provider specialty along with the providers contracting network status to determine the applicable benefits."

Stedi doesn't have a complete list of payers that selectively include or exclude benefits based on the provider's network status. The most reliable way to determine network status is to reach out to the provider or payer directly.

#### Freeform messages

While uncommon, some payers communicate information about the requesting provider's network status using freeform messages. For example, Cigna's [270/271 Companion Guide](https://www.cigna.com/static/www-cigna-com/docs/5010-270-271-companion-guide.pdf) states:

> "When the requestor's network participation status can be determined, Cigna will send a Message on the EB1\*30 Row that indicates either the Health Care Professional (or facility) is in or out of the customer's medical network."

In Stedi's eligibility response, these types of freeform messages are typically included in the `benefitsInformation.additionalInformation.description` property. For example:

* `PROVIDER IS OUT NETWORK FOR MEMBER`
* `BENEFITS RETURNED BASED ON NON-AFFILIATED PROVIDER STATUS`

This `description` property may also contain information about network tier levels, since some plans have more complex benefit structures with reduced patient responsibility for higher-tier providers.

**These freeform messages are not standardized across payers and may even differ across plans for the same payer.** Again, the most reliable way to determine network status is to reach out to the provider or payer directly.

### In Plan Network Indicator

The X12 EDI 271 eligibility response includes a data element called `EB12` (In Plan Network Indicator). Stedi represents this field as the `benefitsInformation.inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode` property in the eligibility benefits response.

Counterintuitively, **this value doesn't indicate whether the provider is in- or -out-of-network for the patient's health plan.**

Instead, the `InPlanNetworkIndicatorCode` specifies whether the specific benefit type applies to in- vs. out-of-network. Most payers include information about both the patient’s in- and out-of-network coverage and benefits in the response, regardless of the requesting provider's network status.

Payers can send the following `inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode` values:

* `Y` - Yes
* `N` - No
* `W` - Not Applicable | This indicates that the benefit applies to **both** in and out-of-network providers.
* `U` - Unknown | This indicates that it is unknown whether the benefits apply to in- or out-of-network providers.

The example `benefitsInformation` object below shows the patient's out-of-network deductible for the calendar year, which is \$7,500 dollars. The `inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode` is `N`, indicating that the deductible is applicable to services performed by providers outside the patient's network.

```json

  "name": "Deductible",
  "coverageLevelCode": "IND",
  "coverageLevel": "Individual",
  "serviceTypeCodes": ["30"],
  "serviceTypes": ["Health Benefit Plan Coverage"],
  "timeQualifierCode": "23",

  "inPlanNetworkIndicator": "No"
}
```

## Is prior authorization required?

Prior authorization (also called pre-authorization or pre-certification) is a requirement that the patient or their provider must get approval before a payer will cover specific services, procedures, medications, or devices. Without it, the payer may deny claims.

Payers use the `benefitsInformation.authOrCertIndicator` property to indicate whether prior authorization is required for the service type code in the eligibility check. It can have the following values:

* `Y` indicates that prior authorization is required.
* `N` indicates that prior authorization is not required.
* `U` indicates that the payer is unable to confirm whether or not prior authorization is required.

If you don't receive the `benefitsInformation.authOrCertIndicator` property in the response, you can assume that prior authorization is not required. Some payers may send additional notes about prior authorization rules in the `benefitsInformation.additionalInformation.description` property.

## Is a referral required?

A referral is a written or electronic authorization from a primary care physician (PCP) to see a specialist or receive certain services. Some health plans won't cover specialty care without a referral.

Payers aren't required to provide information about whether referrals are required for benefits, and we can't provide a definitive list of payers who do. When this information is included, you can find it in the `benefitsInformation.additionalInformation.description` property. You're more likely to receive referral information for members with HMO plans.


# Patient costs
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/eligibility-patient-responsibility-benefits



Some benefits require the patient to pay a portion of the cost of care, also known as patient responsibility. For example, a patient may have a co-payment for in-office visits.

You can use the `benefitsInformation` objects with `benefitsInformation.code` values `A`, `B`, `C`, `F`, `G`, and `Y` to determine the patient's financial responsibility for a given service type code (STC).

## How much will the patient pay?

The following types of benefits indicate patient financial responsibility for care. Note that payers may respond with zero in the `benefitAmount` or `benefitPercent` properties when the patient has no responsibility.

If a particular benefit category is not applicable to a plan, the payer will often send nothing for that category rather than explicitly sending a zero benefit. For example, if a health plan has 20% co-insurance for STC `98` but no co-payment, then typically none of the `benefitsInformation` array entries for that STC will have `benefitsInformation.code` = `B` (Co-Payment).

### Co-Insurance

Co-Insurance is indicated by `benefitsInformation.code` = `A` and always includes a value for the `benefitsInformation.benefitPercent` property.

Co-insurance represents the percentage of a benefit patients are responsible for covering themselves. For example, if a patient has met their annual deductible and their co-insurance is 20 percent, they would pay 20 dollars for a treatment that costs 100 dollars. The amount of co-insurance can differ depending on whether a provider is in-network with the health plan.

### Co-Payment

Co-Payment is indicated by `benefitsInformation.code` = `B` and always includes a value for the `benefitsInformation.benefitAmount` property.

Co-Payment represents a fixed dollar amount a patient must pay for a benefit. For example, a patient may have a 10 dollar co-payment for a physician office visit. The amount of co-payment can differ depending on whether the provider is considered in-network with the health plan.

### Cost Containment

Cost Containment is indicated by `benefitsInformation.code` = `J` and always includes a value for the `benefitsInformation.benefitAmount` property.

Cost Containment refers to rules that a health plan may have in place to control the cost of care. It's typically included in the benefit response when the patient has Medicaid coverage and represents the total amount the patient will have to pay out of their own pocket before their benefits begin.

### Deductible

Deductible is indicated by `benefitsInformation.code` = `C` and always includes a value for the `benefitsInformation.benefitAmount` property.

A deductible represents the total amount the patient will have to pay out of their own pocket before their benefits begin. For example, if a patient's deductible is 1000 dollars, they will have to pay 1000 dollars for covered services before the health plan will start to pay. Then, the patient will typically pay part of the cost of services (such as co-payments) until they reach their out-of-pocket maximum.

Though behavior can vary by payer, the deductible `benefitsInformation` object is often included twice in the response for a given coverage level + service type + network status. One iteration contains a `timeQualifier` like `Calendar Year`, which indicates that the `benefitAmount` value is the patient's total annual deductible. In the second instance, the `timeQualifier` is often `Remaining`, which indicates that the `benefitAmount` value is the patient's *remaining* deductible amount (annual deductible minus what they've already spent for the calendar year).

The following example shows that this patient's annual deductible is 1000 dollars, and they have 500 dollars remaining to meet that deductible:

```json
{
  "code": "C",
  "name": "Deductible",
  "coverageLevelCode": "IND",
  "coverageLevel": "Individual",
  "serviceTypeCodes": [
    "30"
  ],
  "serviceTypes": [
    "Health Benefit Plan Coverage"
  ],
  "planCoverage": "GOLDLITE",
  "timeQualifierCode": "29",
  "timeQualifier": "Remaining",
  "benefitAmount": "500",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode": "Y",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicator": "Yes",
  "benefitsDateInformation": {
    "benefit": "20240101-20241231"
  }
},
{
  "code": "C",
  "name": "Deductible",
  "coverageLevelCode": "IND",
  "coverageLevel": "Individual",
  "serviceTypeCodes": [
    "30"
  ],
  "serviceTypes": [
    "Health Benefit Plan Coverage"
  ],
  "planCoverage": "GOLDLITE",
  "timeQualifierCode": "23",
  "timeQualifier": "Calendar Year",
  "benefitAmount": "1000",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode": "Y",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicator": "Yes",
  "benefitsDateInformation": {
    "benefit": "20240101-20241231"
  }
}
```

### Limitations

Limitations are indicated by `benefitsInformation.code` = `F`. Dental and vision plans often use this benefit type to specify an annual maximum benefit amount.

The Affordable Care Act prevents most commercial health plans from imposing limits on annual or lifetime benefit amounts. However, this generally doesn't apply to government health plans and and some commercial health plans may be exempt. So we recommend checking for limitations for all plan types: medical, dental, and vision.

When present, limitations might include a value for the `benefitsInformation.benefitAmount` property that indicates the maximum benefit amount allocated to the patient. The `description` property is also often (but not always) set to a value like "ANNUAL MAXIMUM".

The following example shows a sample response from a dental payer. The patient has an annual maximum benefit for dental care of 2500 dollars.

```json
{
  "timeQualifier": "Calendar Year",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicator": "Yes",
  "TimeQualifierCode": "23",
  "benefitAmount": "2500",
  "code": "F",
  "coverageLevel": "Individual",
  "inPlanNetworkIndicatorCode": "Y",
  "serviceTypeCodes": [
    "35"
  ],
  "additionalInformation": [
    {
    "description": "ANNUAL MAXIMUM"
    }
  ],
  "serviceTypes": [
    "Dental Care"
  ],
  "name": "Limitations",
  "coverageLevelCode": "IND"
}
```

### Out of Pocket (Stop Loss)

<Warning> This benefits type doesn't apply to most dental plans.</Warning>

Out of Pocket (Stop Loss) is indicated by `benefitsInformation.code` = `G` and always includes a value for the `benefitsInformation.benefitAmount` property.

Out of Pocket (Stop Loss) represents the maximum amount a patient can pay per year. Once the patient reaches this limit, the health plan will pay 100 percent of the allowed amount for covered services unless some other coverage limitation (code `F` [Limitations](#limitations)) applies. For example, if a health plan has a limit of 12 covered mental health visits per year, the patient may still be responsible for covering 100 percent of visits beyond that limit even if they have met their out-of-pocket maximum.

Most health plans are required to set an out-of-pocket maximum, but health plans with provider networks are allowed to have unlimited patient responsibility for out-of-network care. If there is no `benefitsInformation` object in the response that has `benefitsInformation.code` = `G`, the payer is indicating that the out-of-pocket maximum is unlimited.

### Spend Down

Spend Down is indicated by `benefitsInformation.code` = `Y` and always includes a value for the `benefitsInformation.benefitAmount` property.

Spend Down is a process that allows individuals with high medical expenses to qualify for Medicaid even if their income is above the Medicaid income limit. The Spend Down `benefitAmount` represents the total amount the patient will have to pay out of their own pocket before they can receive Medicaid benefits.

## When do payers include patient responsibility?

Not all service type codes (STCs) require payers to return patient responsibility information. For example, health plans are required to support inquiries for the following STCs, but aren't required to return patient responsibility information for them.

* `1` - Medical Care
* `30` - Health Plan Benefit Coverage
* `35` - Dental Care
* `88` - Pharmacy
* `AL` - Vision (Optometry)
* `MH` - Mental Health

However, health plans regulated under HIPAA **must** return any applicable patient co-insurance, co-payment, or deductible amounts for the following service type codes.

* `33` - Chiropractic
* `47` - Hospital
* `48` - Hospital Inpatient
* `50` - Hospital Outpatient
* `86` - Emergency Services
* `98` - Professional (Physician) Visit – Office
* `UC` - Urgent Care

These lists don't necessarily extend to dental or vision plans. Some payers may support returning patient responsibility information for additional STCs.

## No Surprises Act

The No Surprises Act is a federal law that protects patients from surprise medical bills — especially in emergency situations or when they unknowingly receive care from out-of-network providers. Under NSA, patients also have the right to a good faith estimate for non-emergency care if they're uninsured or self-pay.

The No Surprises Act bans surprise billing (also known as balance billing) in these situations:

* **Emergency Services:** Even if patients go to an out-of-network hospital or ER, they only have to pay in-network cost-sharing. This includes services at freestanding ERs and urgent care centers licensed to provide emergency care.
* **Non-Emergency Services at In-Network Facilities:** If patients go to an in-network hospital or surgery center, but an out-of-network provider (like an anesthesiologist or radiologist) treats them, they can't be charged more than their in-network rate.
* **Air Ambulance Services:** Patients are only responsible for their in-network rate.

### How do I know if the NSA applies?

Payers don't typically note when the NSA applies to a patient's plan in the eligibility check response. However, the NSA applies to most health plans, including fully insured and self-funded employer plans. It **doesn't** apply to:

* Ground ambulance services
* Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, or VA patients because these programs already have their own strong balance billing protections
* Some people with health care sharing ministries or short-term limited-duration plans
* Some unlicensed or unregulated providers

## Balance Billing Protection Act

The Balance Billing Protection Act (BBPA) is a Washington state law that protects patients from unexpected medical bills (also known as balance billing) when they receive care from out-of-network providers. It's similar to the No Surprises Act, but it applies specifically to Washington residents with state-regulated plans. It doesn't apply to self-funded employer plans unless they opt in.

The BBPA protects patients from balance billing in the following situations:

* Emergency services, even if patients are treated by an out-of-network provider or at an out-of-network facility.
* Non-emergency services at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center when patients are unknowingly treated by an out-of-network provider (like an anesthesiologist or radiologist).

In these cases, the patient only pays their normal in-network cost-share (deductible, copay, coinsurance), and the provider must work out the rest with their insurer.

### How do I know if the BBPA applies?

When the BBPA applies to a patient's health plan, payers are required to note this in `benefitsInformation` objects with a `benefitsInformation.code` of:

* `1` (Active Coverage)
* `2` (Active - Full Risk Capitation)
* `3` (Active - Services Capitated)
* `4` (Active - Services Capitated to Primary Care Physician)
* `5` (Active - Pending Investigation)
* `6` (Inactive)
* `7` (Inactive - Pending Eligibility Update)
* `8` (Inactive - Pending Investigation)

In these cases, you will see one of the following messages in the `benefitsInformation.additionalInformation.description` property:

> Services provided to this patient are subject to the Balance Billing Protection Act. Please see RCW 48.49.020 for details.

> Services provided to this patient are subject to the No Surprises Act.  Please see RCW 48.49.020 for details.

The following example shows a `benefitsInformation` object with the BBPA message included in the `additionalInformation` array.

```json
{
  "code": "1",
  "name": "Active Coverage",
  "serviceTypeCodes": [
    "30"
  ],
  "serviceTypes": [
    "Health Benefit Plan Coverage"
  ],
  "planCoverage": "Open Access Plus",
  "additionalInformation": [
    {
      "description": "Complete Care Management",
      "description": "Services provided to this patient are subject to the Balance Billing Protection Act. Please see RCW 48.49.020 for details."
    }
  ]
}
```


# Eligibility troubleshooting
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/eligibility-troubleshooting



A list of potential errors and possible resolutions when submitting 270 eligibility checks.

## Payer unable to find patient

Sometimes, a payer can't return benefits information for a patient even when the patient exists in their system. This problem can occur for a couple reasons.

### Multiple matching records

Payers can have multiple records of patients with the same name and date of birth. The payer cannot return benefits information unless they are able to identify a unique match within their system.

To avoid this issue, we recommend:

* Include all of the demographic information available for a patient.
* Include the patient's member ID, if available.

### Information discrepancies

There can be discrepancies between the information the provider has collected from the patient and the record the payer has in their system. These discrepancies can lead to issues returning a patient, even though a match exists. Some examples include differences in spelling the patient's name, using a nickname instead of the full name ("Nick" vs. "Nicolas"), and accidentally transposing numbers in the date of birth.

If a request fails to return the expected member in the response, we recommend progressively sending additional eligibility check requests with fewer patient identity and demographic data elements, or different combinations of those. This allows you to identify and handle cases where there are data errors or discrepancies between payer and provider data.

### Name mismatches

If the payer fails to find a matching plan member due to a name mismatch, the `errors` array in the response typically has the `code` set to one of the following values:

* `65`: Invalid/Missing Patient Name
* `67`: Patient Not Found
* `73`: Invalid/Missing Subscriber/Insured Name
* `75`: Subscriber/Insured Not Found

These error codes are set by the payer, not by Stedi, so it's possible that other error codes could be returned.

Resolving the error may require trying different name variations until the check is successful.

* Replace any nickname or shortened name with the full legal name, for example "Robert" instead of "Bob".
* Replace any non-English or accented characters (letters with diacritical marks) such as "Ñ" or "é" with the closest equivalent within the character restrictions. Stedi automatically replaces most such characters with the usual closest equivalent but this might not match the payer's record. For example, the character "Đ" could be transliterated to "D" or "J" depending on the romanization system used.
* For compound names try using only one or the other part. You can also try try removing the separator, or changing the separator from hyphen to space, or vice versa. Some payers may ignore special or separator characters when performing name searches.
* If the patient has recently changed their name, for example due to marriage, then the name stated by the patient or printed on their ID card might not match the payer's record. Try both the current and previous name.

## Timeout

Insurance payers may take up to 60 seconds to respond to a request, but Stedi holds real-time eligibility check requests open for up to 120 seconds before timing out. During this period, Stedi attempts multiple retries to payers in an effort to complete your request.

Canceling and retrying requests before Stedi's automatic retry period ends may create multiple ongoing requests to payers and increase your concurrency usage.

### Request hedging

When eligibility responses are taking too long, you can use request hedging to try to get results faster. To implement request hedging, send a second request at some internal duration cutoff (for example, 30 seconds) without cancelling the first request. Then, you can use whichever result comes back first. If one of the requests fails, you can wait for the second request to see if it's successful.

## Concurrency limit

Our real-time eligibility check endpoint has rate limiting on a per-account basis. This limit is based on *concurrent* requests, not requests per second. The default rate limit is 5 concurrent requests; if you need a higher limit, reach out to [Support](https://www.stedi.com/contact).

Your transactions per second (and thus your concurrency limit) will vary based on the payer response time. If you reach the maximum concurrency limit, Stedi rejects additional requests with a `429` HTTP code until one of your previous requests is completed. Rejected requests have the following error message:

```
{
  "message": "The request can't be submitted because the sender's submission has been throttled: CUSTOMER_LIMIT",
  "code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "eligibilitySearchId": "019249c7-e176-76b0-a46a-3aef1a519bc4"
}
```

Asynchronous [batch eligibility checks](/healthcare/batch-refresh-eligibility-checks) don’t count toward your Stedi account concurrency budget. This allows you to stage thousands of batch requests while continuing to send real-time requests.

## Retrying requests

Our recommended retry approach depends on the errors and HTTP status codes in the response.

| AAA error     | HTTP status | Retry Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `80`          | -           | Use a set backoff limit between each retry that gets progressively longer each time.

### Validation errors

Stedi validates the structure of your eligibility request and will not submit your request to the payer if it is missing required fields or if the data is not formatted correctly. The following Stedi validation error resulted from a missing `provider` object:

```json
{
  "controlNumber": "123456789",
  "tradingPartnerServiceId": "CIGNA",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "33",
      "description": "Input Errors",
      "followupAction": "Please Correct and Resubmit",
      "possibleResolutions": "Missing required field: provider"
    }
  ],
  "status": "ERROR"
}
```

### Payer AAA errors

When a payer rejects your eligibility check, the 271 response contains one or more [`AAA` Request Validation segments](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-eligibility-benefit-response-x279a1/01GS66YHZPB37ABF34DBPSR213#properties.detail.properties.information_source_level_HL_loop.items.properties.request_validation_AAA) that specify the reasons for the rejection and any recommended follow-up actions. Stedi includes this information in the `aaaErrors` object in the response JSON.

Common causes for AAA errors include:

* Missing or incorrect information for the subscriber, dependent, provider, or payer. In this case, you should correct any errors before resubmitting.
* Issues with payer [enrollment](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#payer-enrollment). Many of these issues require that the provider contact the payer directly to resolve, due to PHI/HIPAA guidelines.
* The payer's system is down or experiencing issues. In this case, the payer may not have actually validated the data in your request. If you receive these types of errors, you should wait a few minutes and resend the request again.

Each error contains a `code` field that corresponds to a `followupAction`:

* `C` - Please Correct and Resubmit
* `N` - Resubmission Not Allowed | Note that this code doesn't mean you should never resubmit the request. Intermediary clearinghouses may send this code when they have temporarily lost connection to the payer, so this code indicates that you should wait at least a few minutes before retrying instead of retrying immediately.
* `P` - Resubmission Allowed
* `S` - Do Not Resubmit; Inquiry Initiated to a Third Party | This code is uncommon
* `R` - Please Resubmit Original Transaction
* `W` - Please Wait 30 Days and Resubmit | This code is uncommon
* `X` - Please Wait 10 Days and Resubmit | This code is uncommon
* `Y` - Do not resubmit; We Will Hold Your Request and Respond Again Shortly | This code is uncommon

AAA errors can be present at multiple different levels in the response, depending on the type. The following example shows an error at the subscriber level (`subscriber.aaaErrors`):

```json
    "subscriber": {
        "memberId": "123456789",
        "firstName": "JANE",
        "lastName": "DOE",
        "entityIdentifier": "Insured or Subscriber",
        "entityType": "Person",
        "dateOfBirth": "190001103",
        "aaaErrors": [
            {
                "field": "AAA",
                "code": "75",
                "description": "Subscriber/Insured Not Found",
                "followupAction": "Please Correct and Resubmit",
                "location": "Loop 2100C",
                "possibleResolutions": "- Subscriber was not found."
            }
        ]
    }
```

### Card Issuer Identifier (80840)

All health plans use (80840) as the first five digits of the Card Issuer Identifier.

This is a placeholder value used for standards compliance only, and you shouldn't pass it in an electronic eligibility check. However, many providers and OCR systems accidentally pass (80840) in other eligibility check fields. For example, they may try to pass this value as a subscriber or dependent ID, causing an [AAA rejection](#payer-aaa-errors) from the payer.

To prevent these types of mistakes, Stedi automatically suppresses any string containing (80840) in the following fields:

| JSON                                                  | X12 EDI                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `subscriber.memberId`                                 | Loop 2100C `NM109` Subscriber Primary Identifier      |
| Any property in `subscriber.additionalIdentification` | Loop 2100C `REF02` Subscriber Supplemental Identifier |
| Any property in `dependent.additionalIdentification`  | Loop 2100D `REF02` Dependent Supplemental Identifier  |

If the payer's eligibility response returns an AAA error, Stedi returns the following warning:

```
The field {FIELD} contains the string "(80840)", which is a known
placeholder prefix for a field that should not be provided in {FIELD}.
We have omitted that value in the request, and the request failed.
Please locate the correct value for {FIELD} and resubmit.
```

To correct this error, read the documentation for the corresponding field, locate the correct value, and resubmit the eligibility check.


# Overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/eligibility-workflows-overview



Eligibility refers to a patient's qualification to receive specific medical benefits, services, or coverage under their health plan.

Stedi allows you to reliably determine patient eligibility, even when the patient doesn't know or can't provide accurate insurance information. Once you integrate with Stedi, you can use the UI tools in Eligibility Manager to test, troubleshoot, and monitor your entire eligibility pipeline.

## Eligibility workflows

Here's an overview of the eligibility workflows you can automate with Stedi's APIs:

* [Eligibility checks](/healthcare/intro-eligibility-checks): Verify a patient's coverage with a specific payer. Eligibility checks return full benefits information from the payer, so they're helpful when you need to determine a patient's financial responsibilities for medical services, such as co-payments, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums.
* [Insurance discovery](/healthcare/insurance-discovery): Find a patient's active health plans using their demographic information, such as their name and date of birth. Insurance discovery checks return the same benefits information as a standard eligibility check, making them a great alternative to eligibility checks when patients can't provide accurate insurance information.
* [Coordination of benefits](/healthcare/coordination-of-benefits): Determine whether a patient has multiple, overlapping coverages and if so, which plan is primarily responsible for payment (primacy). COB checks help you submit claims to the correct payer and avoid claim denials.

## Eligibility Manager

[Eligibility Manager](/healthcare/eligibility-manager) helps you track and manage your entire eligibility pipeline. It provides a centralized view of all your eligibility checks, including real-time and batch requests, and helps you efficiently troubleshoot issues and review patient coverage details.

Within Eligibility Manager, you can also manually submit new eligibility checks and coordination of benefits checks as needed.


# Enhanced claim validation
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/enhanced-claim-validation



Enhanced claim validation uses hundreds of additional *edits* (the industry term for validation rules) to increase claim acceptance rates.

When a claim fails enhanced validation, Stedi does not submit it to the payer. Instead, Stedi returns a synchronous response with a detailed error message you can use to diagnose and fix the issue.

**Enhanced validation is only available for 837P (professional) claims.**

## Enable enhanced validation

To enable enhanced validation for the [Professional Claims](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims) or [Professional Claims Raw x12](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims-raw-x12), set the `Stedi-Validation` header to `snip`.

<Warning>
  There is an **additional cost per claim submission** when you use enhanced validation. Please reach out to support for access and pricing information.
</Warning>

## Example validation error

The following sample error message resulted from a [SNIP validation Level 3](#level-3-balancing) failure. Specifically, the total claim charge amount did not match the total of all service line charge amounts reported in the claim.

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "481",
      "note": "The total claim charge amount must balance to the sum of all service line charge amounts reported in the Professional Service (SV1) segments for this claim.",
      "loop_context": null,
      "validations": [
        {
          "Any": [
            {
              "All": [
                {
                  "Rule": "Expected 'C:2300:1300:CLM-02' (100) to be equal to '[\"P:2400:3700:SV1-02\"]' (92)"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Automatic fixes

When you enable enhanced validation, Stedi also automatically fixes common errors before sending the claim. These include invalid date/time formats and character encoding issues.

## Rejection monitoring

Stedi automatically monitors your 277 rejections to proactively build new rules for enhanced validation based on previous failures.

## SNIP validation

SNIP (Strategic National Implementation Process) validation is a set of guidelines established by the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure claims meet specific standards and rules.

Stedi's enhanced validation tests SNIP levels 1-7, which include a wide range of requirements.

### Level 1: EDI syntax

Determine whether the generated EDI file meets basic X12 standard syntax rules, such as:

* Are the data elements within the specified maximum and minimum lengths?
* Are all of the required segments and elements present?
* Are all of the loops in the correct order?
* Are delimiters used correctly?

### Level 2: HIPAA syntax

Determine whether the generated EDI file complies with HIPAA-specific rules, such as:

* Are all of the required segments and elements present in the claim? For example, the request must include the billing provider's address information and tax identification number.
* Are all required qualifiers included correctly? For example, the request must include a qualifier code that indicates whether the subscriber is an individual person or an non-person entity, such as a company.
* Are the parent-child relationships between segments and elements correct? For example, the Claim Information loop contains child loops with information about various providers, ambulance pickup/dropoff (if applicable), and the service facility.

### Level 3: Balancing

Determine whether the financial data in the claim is computed correctly, such as whether claim totals match the sum of the service line items.

### Level 4: Situations

Determine whether the claim meets the situational rules specified in the HIPAA implementation guide.

Situational rules describe scenarios where when A information is present, B information must also be present. For example, when a claim is for an accident, the request must include the accident date.

### Level 5: External code sets

<Note>
  Not yet supported.
</Note>

Determine whether the values from external code sets used in the claim are valid. This includes:

* Code sets such as ICD, CPT, and NDC as well as status codes and adjustment reason codes.
* Code formats. For example, ICD-10 codes must be alphanumeric with a specific length.

### Level 6: Product type/Type of service

<Note>
  Not yet supported.
</Note>

Determine whether the claim meets the requirements for the specific type of service or product being billed. For example, if the claim is for an ambulance service, does the request include information about the transport reason and distance traveled?

### Level 7: Payer-specific

Determine whether the claim meets additional, payer-specific requirements. For example, Vermont Medicaid requires all uppercase characters in the request. Stedi's enhanced validation checks whether claims to Vermont Medicaid use all uppercase characters and returns a warning if not.


# Enrollment types
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/enrollment-types



Healthcare providers must complete three distinct enrollment processes to work with payers and send transactions through clearinghouses:

* **Credentialing:** Validating a healthcare provider's qualifications
* **Payer enrollment:** Registering a credentialed provider with a specific payer's health plan(s)
* **Transaction enrollment:** Registering a provider to send and receive EDI transactions (such as claims and eligibility checks) through a specific clearinghouse with a specific payer

These enrollments typically happen in sequence: first credentialing, then payer enrollment, and then transaction enrollment, although credentialing and payer enrollment are sometimes combined into a single process. Stedi specifically handles [transaction enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment), the final step needed to exchange eligibility and claims transactions through our clearinghouse.

## Credentialing

Credentialing is the process of validating a healthcare provider's qualifications, including:

* Verification of education, training, and licensure
* Review of board certifications and medical specialties
* Confirmation of work history and malpractice insurance
* Review of any sanctions, restrictions, or malpractice claims

Credentialing establishes that a provider meets the payer's standards for providing care to their members. Once credentialed, a provider becomes eligible to join the payer's networks. Some payers have multiple networks and those networks may contain multiple tiers of providers. In order to actually join a network, the payer may require the provider to agree to a rate schedule and sign a contract with other terms.

**Timeline:** Credentialing typically takes 90-180 days to complete.

**Who handles it:** Providers must complete credentialing directly with each payer or through a specialized credentialing service. **Stedi doesn't handle the credentialing process.**

## Payer enrollment

Payer enrollment (also called provider enrollment) is the process of registering a credentialed provider with a specific payer's health plan(s). This involves:

* Submitting applications to payers for specific lines of business (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial plans)
* Providing information about the provider's practice, such as locations and billing details
* Establishing contract terms for services and reimbursement rates
* Setting up payment arrangements

Payer enrollment establishes a business relationship between the provider and the payer. Once enrolled, the provider can submit claims to the payer and receive payments for services provided to the payer's members. (Payers might also accept at least certain types of claims from non-enrolled providers subject to legal requirements and plan rules.)

**Timeline:** Payer enrollment typically takes 60-120 days after credentialing is complete. However, this process is sometimes combined with or conducted in parallel with the credentialing process.

**Who handles it:** Providers must complete payer enrollment directly with each payer. **Stedi doesn't handle the payer enrollment process.**

## Transaction enrollment

Transaction enrollment is the process of registering a provider to send and receive electronic EDI transactions (such as claims and eligibility checks) through a specific clearinghouse with a specific payer. This involves:

* Submitting the provider's name, tax ID (EIN / TIN), NPI, billing address, and contact information
* Specifying which transaction types (e.g., claims, eligibility checks, ERAs) the provider wants to exchange electronically
* Setting up the necessary technical connections between the clearinghouse and payer

Once enrolled, the provider can send and receive specific transactions with the payer through the clearinghouse.

**Timeline:** Transaction enrollment typically takes 2-6 weeks, depending on the payer.

**Who handles it:** Stedi handles the transaction enrollment process on behalf of providers. Visit [Transaction enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) to learn how to complete transaction enrollment through Stedi.

<Warning>
  Transaction enrollment is specific to each clearinghouse. If you switch from another clearinghouse to Stedi, you'll need to complete transaction enrollment through Stedi even if you were previously enrolled with the same payer through a different clearinghouse.

# Insurance discovery checks
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/insurance-discovery



Eligibility checks verify a patient's coverage with a specific payer. But what if you don't know the patient's insurance details or you're not sure whether they have coverage at all? In these situations, you can use an insurance discovery check to find a patient's active coverage using only their demographic data.

You may need to perform an insurance discovery check when a patient provides outdated insurance details, doesn’t have their insurance card, or can’t provide insurance details in an urgent care situation. You may also want to use insurance discovery checks to simplify patient onboarding by reducing the amount of information new patients must provide to schedule an appointment.

Once you identify active coverage through an insurance discovery check, we recommend performing a [coordination of benefits (COB) check](/healthcare/coordination-of-benefits) to determine whether the patient has active coverage with additional payers and which payer is responsible for paying claims (primacy).

## How insurance discovery checks work

Here's how insurance discovery checks work:

1. Call the [Insurance Discovery Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-insurance-discovery) endpoint with as much patient demographic information as possible to increase the chances of finding matching coverage. You'll also include information like the provider's NPI and the date of service, similar to an eligibility check.
2. Stedi determines if the patient has active coverage with one or more payers. This process involves demographic lookups to enrich partial patient details, comparisons across third-party data sources to determine member IDs, and submitting real-time eligibility checks to payers to detect coverage.
3. Stedi returns an array of potential active coverages along with subscriber details and benefits information.

You should always review the results to ensure the returned subscriber information for each active health plan matches the demographic information for the patient. Once you confirm matching coverage, you can use the benefits information to determine the patient’s eligibility for services. You generally shouldn't need to perform a follow-up eligibility check since the insurance discovery response includes the same benefits information as a standard eligibility check.

## Enrollment requirements

Before you can perform insurance discovery checks, you must complete [transaction enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) for Payer ID: DISCOVERY.

### Medicaid Provider ID

A Medicaid Provider ID is a unique identification number assigned to a healthcare provider when they enroll with a state Medicaid program. It's different than a provider's [National Provider Identifier (NPI)](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier), which is assigned by the federal government. If a provider works in multiple states, they'll have different Medicaid IDs for each state.

Medicaid Provider IDs aren't required for transaction enrollment with Stedi, but they can enhance insurance discovery check results for certain payers. To add Medicaid Provider IDs to transaction enrollment requests, please email [enrollments@stedi.com](mailto:enrollments@stedi.com) with a CSV file containing the NPI and Medicaid ID(s) for each provider.

Many state Medicaid agencies have a provider lookup tool you can use to find a provider's Medicaid Provider ID. For example, for providers who practice in Texas, you can use the [Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership Provider lookup tool](https://opl.tmhp.com/) to search for enrolled providers. You can also call the state Medicaid agency to request a provider's ID.

## Required patient information

At a minimum, you **must** provide the patient's first name, last name, and date of birth (DOB) in each insurance discovery check.

However, the more demographic information you provide, the more likely Stedi is to find matching coverage with a high confidence level. Generally, the more common the patient's name, the more important it is to include more demographic information. Regardless, we **strongly recommend** providing as much of the following additional patient information as possible:

* Current address - especially the patient's ZIP code, as this helps narrow down the list of probable payers.
* Previous addresses
* Social Security Number (SSN)
* Phone number
* Gender

## Manual submission

You can submit insurance discovery checks through the [Create insurance discovery check](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/insurance-discovery/create) form in the Stedi portal.

Unlike eligibility checks, Stedi doesn't display historical insurance discovery checks in the portal for review.

## API submission

You can submit an insurance discovery check using the [Insurance Discovery Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-insurance-discovery) endpoint.

### Request

The following example shows the payload for an insurance discovery check.

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "organizationName": "THE DOCTORS OFFICE",
    "npi": "1999999984"
  },
  "encounter": {
    "beginningDateOfService": "20250326",
    "endDateOfService": "20250328"

  },
  "controlNumber": "123456789",
  "subscriber": {
    "dateOfBirth": "20010925",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "address": {
      "address1": "1 MAIN ST",
      "address2": "UNIT 1",
      "city": "ANYTOWN",
      "state": "MO",
      "postalCode": "12341"
    }
  }
}
```

### Response

Stedi's synchronous response to the [Insurance Discovery Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-insurance-discovery) endpoint can take up to 120 seconds to return, though it's often faster.

The synchronous response can have one of two `status` values:

* `COMPLETE` - Stedi has completed the insurance discovery check for the patient. If Stedi finds coverage for the patient, the `items` array will contain the results. If Stedi doesn't find any coverage for the patient, the `items` array will be empty.
* `PENDING` - Stedi is still processing the insurance discovery check for the patient. You can use the `discoveryId` in the response to [retrieve the results asynchronously](#retrieve-results-asynchronously).

The following example response shows a `PENDING` insurance discovery check. In this case, you would use the `discoveryId` to retrieve the results asynchronously.

```json Insurance discovery check in progress
{
  "discoveryId": "12345678-abcd-4321-efgh-987654321abc",
  "meta": {
    "applicationMode": "production",
    "traceId": "1-abcdef12-123456789abcdef123456789"
  },
  "status": "PENDING",
  "items": []
}
```

The following example response shows a `COMPLETE` insurance discovery check. Stedi found one instance of potential matching coverage for the patient, Jane Doe. The information is available in the `items` array.

* The `payer` is Aetna.
* The patient in the request, Jane, is a dependent on the Aetna plan because her demographic information appears in the `dependent` object in the response.
* The `confidence.level` is marked as `REVIEW_NEEDED`, because the dependent's last name is slightly different from the patient's last name in the insurance discovery request. However, all of the other demographic details in the dependent object - first name, date of birth, address - match the patient from the request. The two-part last name, Smith Doe, appears to be the complete version of the last name in the request, Doe. Based on this information, we can confirm that this is active coverage for the patient.
* The `benefitsInformation object` (truncated to keep this example concise) contains the patient's benefits details. For example, the patient has active medical coverage under their health plan for the service dates in the request. Visit [Determine patient benefits](/healthcare/eligibility-active-coverage-benefits) to learn more about interpreting the benefits information in the insurance discovery check response.
* Payer names and IDs aren't normalized, so you'll need to handle matching these results to Stedi's Payer Network or your own internal payer list.

}
```

## Retrieve results asynchronously

If the synchronous insurance discovery response indicates that the search is still `PENDING`, you can use the `discoveryId` to retrieve the complete results asynchronously from the [Insurance Discovery Check Results](/api-reference/healthcare/get-insurance-discovery-results) endpoint.

You can begin polling immediately after receiving the `PENDING` status response from the synchronous endpoint. Like the synchronous endpoint, the Insurance Discovery Check Results endpoint can take up to 120 seconds to return a response.

It's unlikely for the insurance discovery process to take more than a few minutes, so it's rare to have to poll the asynchronous endpoint more than once. However, if you receive a `PENDING` status, you can poll the endpoint immediately again, and continue this polling process until the status changes to `COMPLETE`.

Note that you should only expect to retrieve checks submitted within the last 24 hours. After 24 hours, the results may no longer be available.

## Coordination of benefits (COB) checks

Insurance discovery checks aren't guaranteed to return all of a patient's active health plans, so a follow-up COB check can help you determine whether the patient has active coverage with additional payers and which payer is responsible for paying claims (primacy).

Once you receive the results of an insurance discovery check, we recommend performing [COB checks](/healthcare/coordination-of-benefits) for the patient using one of their active commercial plans.


# Overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/intro-eligibility-checks



An eligibility check is the process of verifying whether a patient has coverage for specific medical benefits under their health insurance plan. This process allows patients and healthcare providers to determine a patient's financial responsibilities for medical services.

You can send either real-time or batch eligibility checks through Stedi. With real-time requests, you receive the benefits response from the payer in seconds. With batch requests, you can submit up to 500 eligibility checks in a single request for Stedi to process asynchronously.

<Tip>
  Eligibility checks verify coverage with a specific payer. If you don't know the payer, you can perform an [insurance discovery check](/healthcare/insurance-discovery) instead to find a patient's coverage using their demographic data.
</Tip>

## Real-time eligibility checks

Real-time eligibility checks are ideal for in-person patient visits, telehealth appointments, and other scenarios where you need immediate information about a patient's coverage.

We recommend always starting with real-time checks when integrating with a new payer. This approach allows you to quickly test and refine your pipeline through fast feedback loops. Once you're comfortable with real-time checks, you may also want to start sending asynchronous batch checks to perform periodic refreshes for all or a subset of patients.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit eligibility checks to Stedi.">
    Stedi supports sending real-time eligibility checks to payers, in either JSON or X12 EDI format. You can submit requests manually through the Stedi portal or programmatically through the API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stedi delivers eligibility checks to the payer.">
    Stedi routes requests to the payer using the most reliable connection. Stedi receives payer responses in X12 EDI and transforms them into JSON to make them easier to ingest into your business systems.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive the payer's benefit response in real time.">
    Stedi returns the payer's synchronous benefit response. It contains details about a patient's medical coverage, including the start and end date of the coverage, covered benefits and services, copayments, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Learn more about [Real-time eligibility checks](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks).

## Batch eligibility checks

Asynchronous batch checks are a great option for performing periodic eligibility refreshes for all or a subset of patients because they don't count toward your Stedi account [concurrency budget](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#api-concurrency-limit). This allows you to stage thousands of batch requests while simultaneously sending real-time eligibility checks as needed.

Batch checks have a longer feedback cycle than real-time checks because you don't receive the payer's response immediately. That's why we strongly recommend starting with [real-time checks](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) when integrating with a new payer or working with eligibility checks for the first time. This approach allows you to ensure that your pipeline is working smoothly before you begin staging batch checks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit eligibility checks to Stedi.">
    You can submit up to 500 eligibility checks in a single request to Stedi's [Batch Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-batch-eligibility) API. These requests have the same structure as real-time eligibility checks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stedi delivers eligibility checks to the payer.">
    Stedi processes these batch checks asynchronously, implementing best practices to avoid payer throttling. Stedi routes requests to the payer using the most reliable connection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Poll to retrieve benefit responses.">
    The endpoint returns a synchronous response containing a `batchId` that you can use to retrieve the results of the batch checks using the [Poll Batch Eligibility Checks](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-polling-eligibility) endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Learn more about [Batch eligibility checks](/healthcare/batch-refresh-eligibility-checks).

## X12 HIPAA format

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates that eligibility checks be submitted in a standardized format: X12 HIPAA. X12 HIPAA is a type of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), a data format developed in the 1970s to allow businesses to exchange documents electronically.

While some healthcare institutions can submit eligibility checks directly in X12 HIPAA, many of today's software applications are built to use more modern data formats like JSON. That's why Stedi offers two types of APIs for eligibility checks: one that accepts JSON and automatically converts it to X12 HIPAA behind the scenes, and another that accepts X12 HIPAA directly.

## Billing for eligibility checks

There are three classes of eligibility transactions that are considered non-billable:

1. All eligibility checks you send in [Test Mode](/healthcare/test-mode).
2. All eligibility checks that return `AAA` = `42` or `AAA` = `80` errors (which indicate that the payer is down).
3. All API calls that return 4xx or 5xx errors.

All other transactions are billed at the usage rates according to your contract.


# Overview
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/intro-to-claims-processing



A claim is a request for payment submitted to an insurance company or health plan. It details the medical services rendered to a patient, including information about the diagnosis, treatment, and any procedures performed. The claim is used to determine the reimbursement amount that the submitter (typically a medical provider) should receive from the insurance company.

You can programmatically submit claims and claim status requests through Stedi's APIs. You can also submit claims through Stedi's fully-managed SFTP server.

## API claims processing

You can submit most claim types and real-time claim status requests to Stedi's APIs in either JSON or X12 EDI format. We recommend this approach when you want to submit claims and claim status requests programmatically without dealing with the complexities of the X12 EDI format.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit claims and claim status requests to Stedi.">
    Stedi supports sending the following transactions to payers:

    * 837P (Professional) Health Care Claim |
      [JSON API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims) | [X12 EDI API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims-raw-x12)
    * 837I (Institutional) Health Care Claim | [JSON API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-institutional-claims)
    * 837D (Dental) Health Care Claim | [JSON API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-dental-claims) | [X12 EDI API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-dental-claims-raw-x12)
    * 276 Claim Status Request | [JSON API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status) | [X12 EDI API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status-raw-x12)

    Stedi automatically translates JSON requests into X12 EDI and validates requests to ensure they comply with HIPAA and the payer's specifications.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stedi delivers requests to the payer.">
    Stedi routes requests to the payer. Stedi receives payer responses in X12 EDI and transforms them into JSON to make them easier to ingest into your business systems.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive payer responses from Stedi.">
    * Stedi returns synchronous claim status responses from the payer in real time.
    * You can either poll or listen for event-driven webhooks to discover new Claim Acknowledgment (277) and Electronic Remittance Advice (835) responses. Then, you can use Stedi's APIs to retrieve these responses in JSON format.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Learn more about API submission for [professional](/healthcare/submit-professional-claims), [institutional](/healthcare/submit-institutional-claims), and [dental](/healthcare/submit-dental-claims) claims.

## SFTP claims processing

We recommend Stedi SFTP when you have an existing system that generates X12 EDI files, and you want to send them through Stedi without completing an API integration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create SFTP users.">
    You can create both test and production SFTP users. Test users can only send claims to Stedi’s test clearinghouse, which helps ensure you never accidentally send test claims to payers while you’re getting up and running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drop claims onto Stedi's SFTP server.">
    Connect to Stedi’s server and drop compliant X12 EDI professional, institutional, or dental claim files into the `to-stedi` directory.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stedi processes the claim.">
    Stedi automatically validates the claim data and routes your claims to the test or production clearinghouse.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retrieve claim responses from the SFTP server.">
    Stedi places claim responses - 277 Claim Acknowledgments and 835 ERAs - into the `from-stedi` directory in X12 EDI format. You can retrieve these responses from the directory at your preferred cadence.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates that claims and claim status requests be submitted in a standardized format: X12 HIPAA. X12 HIPAA is a type of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), a data format developed in the 1970s to allow businesses to exchange documents electronically.

While some healthcare institutions can submit claims and claim status requests directly in X12 HIPAA, many of today's software applications are built to use more modern data formats like JSON. That's why Stedi offers two types of APIs for claims processing: one that accepts JSON and automatically converts it to X12 HIPAA behind the scenes, and another that accepts X12 HIPAA directly.


# Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) lookup
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/mbi-lookup



A [Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI)](https://www.cms.gov/training-education/partner-outreach-resources/new-medicare-card/medical-beneficiary-identifiers-mbis) is a unique, randomly-generated identifier assigned to individuals enrolled in Medicare. You must include the patient's MBI in every eligibility check you submit to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ([Payer ID: CMS](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network?page=0\&search=CMS\&entry=JDNSN)).

When patients don't know their MBI, you can use Stedi's eligibility APIs to perform an MBI lookup using their Social Security Number instead. Stedi returns a complete benefits response from CMS containing the patient’s coverage status as well as their MBI for future reference.

<Warning>
  There is an additional cost to perform MBI lookups with Stedi's eligibility check APIs. Please contact Stedi customer support to enable access and add MBI lookups to your agreement.
</Warning>

## Enrollment

Before you can perform MBI lookups, you must complete [transaction enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) for [Payer ID: MBILU](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network?page=0\&search=MBILU\&entry=ASKVB).

## Perform an MBI Lookup

You can perform MBI lookups using Stedi's [Real-Time Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) and [Batch Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-batch-eligibility) APIs.

### Request

Construct an eligibility check request that includes the patient's first name, last name, date of birth, and Social Security Number (SSN).

Set the `tradingPartnerServiceId` to `MBILU`. This is a special Payer ID that tells Stedi to perform an MBI lookup for the patient in addition to a standard eligibility check.

The following sample request performs an MBI lookup for a patient named Jane Doe.

```json Example MBI Lookup request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://healthcare.us.stedi.com/2024-04-01/change/medicalnetwork/eligibility/v3 \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "controlNumber": "123456789",
  "tradingPartnerServiceId": "MBILU",
  "externalPatientId": "UAA111222333",
  "encounter": {
    "serviceTypeCodes": [
      "30"
    ]
  },
  "provider": {
    "organizationName": "ACME Health Services",
    "npi": "1999999984"
  },
  "subscriber": {
    "dateOfBirth": "19000101",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "ssn": "123456789"
  }
}'
```

### Response

Stedi uses the patient’s demographic data and SSN to perform an MBI lookup. If there is a match, Stedi submits an eligibility check to CMS.

Stedi returns a complete benefits response from CMS for the patient and places the patient's MBI in the `subscriber.memberId` property.
Visit [Determine patient benefits](/healthcare/eligibility-active-coverage-benefits) for details about how you can use the benefits response to determine a patient's coverage status and benefits.

The following example shows a CMS benefits response returned from an MBI lookup. In this scenario, the patient's MBI is `1AA2CC3DD45`.

## Mock request

When you submit the following mock MBI lookup request to the [Real-Time Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) endpoint with a [test API key](/api-reference/index#api-key-types), Stedi returns mock benefits data you can use for testing.

<Tip>
  Mock requests are free for testing purposes and won't incur any charges in
  your Stedi account.
</Tip>

Request Notes:

* `encounter`: Only service type code 30 is supported.
* `provider`: You can use any organization name and any NPI, as long as it passes check digit validation. To generate a dummy NPI, you can use this [free tool](https://jsfiddle.net/alexdresko/cLNB6).
* `subscriber`: You must use the exact values in the test request. Other birth dates, first names, last names, and Social Security Numbers return errors.

## Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN)

Some payers return the patient's MBI in one of the following properties of the standard eligibility response:

* [`benefitsInformation.benefitsAdditionalInformation.hicNumber`](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility#response-benefits-information-benefits-additional-information-hic-number)
* [`planInformation.hicNumber`](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility#response-plan-information-hic-number)

If the value in either of these properties  matches the format specified in the [Medicare Beneficiary Identifier documentation](https://www.cms.gov/training-education/partner-outreach-resources/new-medicare-card/medical-beneficiary-identifiers-mbis), the number is likely an MBI. In these cases, you don't need to perform an MBI lookup - you can use this value in a standard eligibility check to CMS.

You're most likely to receive an MBI in eligibility check responses from commercial Medicare Advantage plans, but they can also be present in responses from Medicaid plans for dual-eligible patients.


# National Provider Identifier (NPI)
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/national-provider-identifier



The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique identification number assigned to healthcare providers. It’s used to identify providers in healthcare transactions, like billing, referrals, and insurance claims, and it's required when processing administrative and financial transactions adopted under HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).

If a provider has an NPI, it's required when completing [transaction enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) and when sending any healthcare transaction through Stedi, including eligibility checks and claims. When providers don't have an NPI, you'll need to submit another identifier, such as their Social Security Number (SSN) instead. Providers who don't have an NPI are typically non-medical providers, such as social workers, home health aides, or transportation services.

## NPI types

There are two types of NPIs:

* **Type 1 - Individual:** This type of NPI is for individual healthcare providers, such as doctors, dentists, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, and chiropractors. Note that providers who run their own practice likely still need to obtain an individual NPI to use when billing services under their own name.
* **Type 2 - Organization:** This type of NPI is for healthcare organizations or group practices, such as hospitals, clinics, labs, nursing homes, and home health agencies. This type of NPI is used when billing services under the organization’s name, not an individual person. Unlike individual NPIs, a single organization can have multiple organization NPIs for different locations, divisions, or services.

## Find a provider's NPI

You can look up a provider's NPI using the [NPPES NPI Registry](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/search). The registry allows you to search for NPIs by name, organization, or NPI number. You can also verify the status of an NPI and view the provider's information, including their taxonomy codes and practice locations.

## Generate a dummy NPI

You can generate a dummy NPI for test transactions using this [free online tool](https://jsfiddle.net/alexdresko/cLNB6). Note that these dummy NPIs aren't valid for production transactions.

## Apply for an NPI

You can obtain an NPI from the [National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES)](https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/webhelp/nppeshelp/NPPES%20FAQS.html#how-do-i-apply-for-an-npi). The process includes the following steps:

You'll be required to provide the following in your application:

* Personal information, such as your name, address, and phone number
* Type of provider (individual or organization)
* Provider specialty (taxonomy code)
* Practice location and contact information
* Other information, such as your state license number and the name of your state licensing board

Most online applications are processed within 10 business days; paper applications may take longer. Once approved, you'll receive your 10-digit NPI number through email or mail, depending on how you applied.

## NPI format and validation

The NPI is a 10-position, intelligence-free numeric identifier (10-digit number). This means that the numbers do not carry other information about healthcare providers, such as the state in which they live or their medical specialty.

The NPI format consists of 9 numeric digits followed by one numeric check digit. The check digit is calculated using the Luhn formula. When you submit a transaction such as an eligibility check or claim to Stedi, we validate the NPI before submitting it to the upstream payer. At a minimum, we validate that the submitted number passes check digit validation. For example, NPIs in test eligibility checks submitted with a test API key must pass check digit validation. In certain cases, we also validate that the NPI exists in the NPPES database.

### Calculate the check digit manually

Assume the 9-position identifier part of the NPI is 123456789. Using the Luhn formula on the identifier portion, you would calculate the check digit as follows:

1. Double the value of alternate digits, beginning with the rightmost digit:

   2  6  10  14  18
2. Add a constant 24 (to account for the 80840 prefix that would be present on a card issuer identifier), plus the individual digits of the products of doubling, plus unaffected digits:

   24 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 8 = 67
3. Subtract the sum from the next higher number ending in zero:

   70 - 67 = 3

The check digit is 3. So, the final NPI with check digit is 1234567893.


# Get and correlate acknowledgments and ERAs
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/receive-claim-responses



After you submit a professional, dental, or institutional claim, you may receive asynchronous 277 Claim Acknowledgment (277CA) and Electronic Remittance Advice (835 ERA) responses.

If you submitted the claims through the API or UI, there are two steps to retrieve claim responses from Stedi:

1. Discover responses by polling for processed transactions or listening for event-driven webhooks.
2. Call Stedi's APIs to retrieve processed responses from Stedi.

Once you have the responses, you can correlate them with the original claim and specific service lines.

<Tip>
  If you're using a [Stedi SFTP connection](/healthcare/submit-claims-sftp-connection), you don't need to poll or call Stedi's APIs to retrieve responses. Instead, you can download them from the `from-stedi` directory.
</Tip>

## Response types

You can receive two types of responses after you submit a professional, institutional, or dental claim.

### Claim Acknowledgment (277CA)

The 277CA indicates whether the claim was accepted or rejected and (if relevant) the reasons for rejection. Though it can contain claim status information, the 277CA is different from the synchronous 277 Claim Status response you receive after submitting a [real-time claim status](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status) request.

You may receive multiple separate 277CAs for each claim you submit.

* You'll receive the first 277CA from Stedi within about 30 minutes of submitting the claim. This 277 may contain rejection message(s) and warnings, if applicable.
* You may receive additional 277CAs from intermediary clearinghouses.
* You'll receive one or more 277CAs from the payer. Typically, there is one 277CA that indicates receipt of the claim and a second 277CA that contains summary counts of transactions received, information about accepted transactions, and details for rejected transactions.

You can determine whether a 277CA is from a clearinghouse or the payer from the [`transactions.payers` array](https://www.stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-277#response-transactions-payers) in the report. The `organizationName` property contains the name of the sender (for example, `CIGNA`) and the `identityIdentifierCodeValue` contains either `Clearinghouse` or `Payer`.

This information is also available at the top of the 277CA's [transaction details page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) in the Stedi portal.

### Electronic Remittance Advice (835 ERA)

The 835 ERA, also known as a claim payment, contains details about payments for specific services and explanations for any adjustments or denials.

<Tip>
  Processing 835 ERAs almost always requires [enrollment](/healthcare/supported-payers#enrollment) with the payer.
</Tip>

### 277CA claim status objects

The 277CA response contains two main objects for claim status information:

* `informationClaimStatuses`: This is the primary section to examine for detailed acceptance/rejection status of a claim. It contains information that would be useful to the submitter of the claim regarding acceptance/rejection, including:
  * Payer-specific rejection reasons
  * Claim charge amount details
  * The `patientControlNumber` from the claim (returned as `patientAccountNumber`)
  * All granular claim processing details

* `providerClaimStatuses`: This section contains more generic information that would be useful to the provider regarding rejection/acceptance. It typically only includes basic status information like "accepted for processing" or "denied" without the granular information in `informationClaimStatuses`.

## Discover processed responses

You can discover processed responses by either listening for webhooks or polling for transactions.

### Listen for webhooks

Instead of polling for transactions, you can set up [webhooks](/healthcare/configure-webhooks) that automatically send events for processed 277CAs and 835 ERAs to your endpoint. You can either create a single webhook for all inbound transactions or create a separate webhook for each transaction type.

These webhooks are triggered by the transaction processed event Stedi emits after it successfully processes a response from the payer or intermediary clearinghouse.

As these events are emitted, you can:

* Determine the transaction type from the `x12.transactionSetIdentifier` field: `277` (Claim Acknowledgment) or `835` (ERA).
* Use the `transactionId` to retrieve the transaction from Stedi.

<Warning>
  If your webhook doesn't respond within 5 seconds, Stedi marks that as a failure and then automatically retries up to 5 times. This can result in duplicate deliveries, so we strongly recommend implementing ways to manage duplicates delivered through webhooks.
</Warning>

### Poll for transactions

Call the [Poll Transactions](/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-pollingtransactions) endpoint to return a list of transactions in your Stedi account.

You must include the following information in the request:

* Your Stedi API key as the `Authorization` header.
* Either the `startDateTime` or `pageToken` query parameters. To retrieve a list of transactions after a specific date, use `startDateTime`. To retrieve the next page of transactions, use `pageToken` (you can find this value in the `nextPageToken` field in the response).

The following example shows an API call to retrieve transactions after a specific date:

```bash
  curl --request GET -L \
    --url https://core.us.stedi.com/2023-08-01/polling/transactions?startDateTime=2023-08-28T00:00:00Z \
    --header "Authorization: ${STEDI_API_KEY}" 
```

**Filter for 277CA and 835 ERA transactions**

The response includes all transactions that have been sent or received, including all 837 claims you have submitted and all 277CA and 835 ERA responses you have received from payers. You must filter for transactions that match the following criteria:

* `direction`: `INBOUND` - This indicates that the transaction came from the payer or intermediary clearinghouse.
* `x12.transactionSetIdentifier`: `277` or `835`

The following example shows a response containing a processed 277CA transaction:

For each matching transaction, extract the `transactionId` and `x12.transactionSetIdentifier` type to use when mapping the data.

<Warning>
  Stedi does not allow you to delete transactions, so make sure you track which `transactionIds` you have already processed.
</Warning>

## Retrieve responses from Stedi

Use the following APIs to retrieve 277CA and 835 ERA responses from Stedi in JSON format:

* [Get 277CA Report](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-277): Retrieve 277CA responses
* [Get 835 ERA Report](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835): Retrieve 835 ERA responses

You must include the following information in the request:

* Your Stedi API key as the `Authorization` header.
* The `transactionId` query parameter, which specifies the processed transaction you want to retrieve. You can find this ID in the response from either the [Poll Transactions API](#poll-for-transactions) or the configured [webhook](#listen-for-webhooks).

## Correlate responses with original claim

You can use the following identifiers from the original claim to correlate the 277CA and 835 ERA responses.

### Entire claim

Use the `claimInformation.patientControlNumber` from the original claim.

* In the 277CA response, this number is returned as the `transactions.payers.claimStatusTransactions.claimStatusDetails.patientClaimStatusDetails.claims.claimStatus.patientAccountNumber`.
* In the 835 response, this number is returned as the `transactions.detailInfo.paymentInfo.claimPaymentInfo.patientControlNumber`.

### Specific service lines

The professional and institutional claim types use different names for the same identifier:

* **Professional:** Use `claimInformation.serviceLines.providerControlNumber` from the original claim, if provided.
* **Institutional:** Use `claimInformation.serviceLines.lineItemControlNumber` from the original claim, if provided.

Location in responses:

* In the 277CA response, this number is sometimes returned as the `transactions.payers.claimStatusTransactions.claimStatusDetails.patientClaimStatusDetails.claims.serviceLines.lineItemControlNumber`.

  This is because a 277CA only contains a `serviceLines` object (which contains the `lineItemControlNumber`) if it was rejected because of issues with the information provided for the service line. The following snippet shows a `serviceLines` object for a rejected claim containing the `lineItemControlNumber` property.

## Crossover claims

A claim is called a crossover claim when it is adjudicated by one payer and then forwarded to another payer for additional processing. This is common in coordination of benefits (COB) situations, where a patient has multiple insurance policies. For example, a patient may have coverage through both Medicare and private supplemental insurance. Once Medicare adjudicates the claim, it "crosses over" electronically to the secondary payer. This process helps reduce paperwork for providers and ensures the patient is billed correctly for any remaining balance.

You'll know a claim has been sent to a crossover payer when you receive an ERA with the [`transactions.detailInfo.paymentInfo.claimPaymentInfo.claimStatusCode`](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835#response-transactions-detail-info-payment-info-claim-payment-info-claim-status-code) property set to either `19`, `20`, or `21`. The ERA should also include information about the crossover payer in the [`transactions.detailInfo.paymentInfo.crossoverClaim`](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835#response-transactions-detail-info-payment-info-crossover-carrier) object.

Sometimes, the different payers are separate legal entities within the same parent corporation. If not, you'll need to [enroll](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) the provider separately with the crossover payer before they can process the claim. The payer may pause claim processing until the enrollment is complete or reject the claim. If the claim is rejected, you'll need to manually resubmit it once the enrollment is live. [Stedi support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) can help you determine when you need to enroll with a crossover payer and determine the status of crossover claims while the enrollment is in progress.

You may receive an additional 835 ERA and/or 277CAs from the crossover payer. You may also be able to use the information from any 277CAs to submit real-time claim status requests for the crossover claim.

## ERA code lists

You may need to refer to the following code lists while evaluating the 835 ERA. Note that this page doesn't list all possible code lists, only those that are too long to properly represent within the API documentation.

### Claim Adjustment Group Code

This code is returned in the [`transactions.detailInfo.paymentInfo.claimAdjustments.claimAdjustmentGroupCode` property](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835#response-transactions-detail-info-payment-info-claim-adjustments-claim-adjustment-group-code). It categorizes the adjustment reason codes returned in the `claimAdjustments` object.

<Accordion title="Claim Adjustment Group Code list">
  * `CO` - Contractual Obligations | The payer uses this code when a joint payer/payee contractual agreement or a regulatory requirement resulted in an adjustment. An example of a contractual obligation might be a Participating Provider Agreement.
  * `OA` - Other adjustments | The payer uses this code when the adjustment doesn't fall within the other categories.
  * `PI` - Payor Initiated Reductions | The payer uses this code when, in their opinion, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments).
  * `PR` - Patient Responsibility | The payer uses this code when the adjustment amount is the responsibility of the patient.
</Accordion>

### Claim Filing Indicator Code

This code is returned in the [`transactions.detailInfo.paymentInfo.claimPaymentInfo.claimFilingIndicatorCode` property](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835#response-transactions-detail-info-payment-info-claim-payment-info-claim-filing-indicator-code). It identifies the type of claim submitted.

<Accordion title="Claim Filing Indicator Code list">
  * `12` - Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) | This code is also used for Blue Cross/Blue Shield participating provider arrangements.
  * `13` - Point of Service (POS)
  * `14` - Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)
  * `15` - Indemnity Insurance | This code is also used for Blue Cross/Blue Shield non-participating provider arrangements.

### Claim Status Code

This code is returned in the [`transactions.detailInfo.paymentInfo.claimPaymentInfo.claimStatusCode` property](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835#response-transactions-detail-info-payment-info-claim-payment-info-claim-status-code). It identifies the status of an entire claim as assigned by the payer, claim review organization, or repricing organization.

Codes `19`, `20`, and `21` indicate that the claim is a [crossover claim](/healthcare/receive-claim-responses#crossover-claims) that has been forwarded to an additional payer for processing. This practice is common in coordination of benefits (COB) scenarios. You may need to enroll the provider with the additional payer before they can process the claim.

<Accordion title="Claim Status Code list">
  * `1` - Processed as Primary | The payer uses this code when the claim was adjudicated by the current payer as primary regardless of whether any part of the claim was paid.
  * `2` - Processed as Secondary | The payer uses this code when the claim was adjudicated by the current payer as secondary regardless of whether any part of the claim was paid.
  * `3` - Processed as Tertiary | The payer uses this code when the claim was adjudicated by the current payer as tertiary (or subsequent) regardless of whether any part of the claim was paid.
  * `4` - Denied | The payer uses this code when the Patient/Subscriber is not recognized, and the claim was not forwarded to another payer.
  * `19` - Processed as Primary, Forwarded to Additional Payer(s)
  * `20` - Processed as Secondary, Forwarded to Additional Payer(s)
  * `21` - Processed as Tertiary, Forwarded to Additional Payer(s)
  * `22` - Reversal of Previous Payment
  * `23` - Not Our Claim, Forwarded to Additional Payer(s) | The payer sends this code when the patient/subscriber is not recognized or the claim was not adjudicated by the payer, but other payers are known and the claim has been forwarded to another payer.
  * `25` - Predetermination Pricing Only - No Payment
</Accordion>

### Credit or Debit Flag Code

This code is returned in the [`transactions.financialInformation.creditOrDebitFlagCode` property](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835#response-transactions-financial-information-credit-or-debit-flag-code). It indicates whether the payment is a credit or a debit.

* `C` - Credit | The payer uses this code to indicate a credit to the provider's account and a debit to the payer's account, initiated by the payer. In the case of an EFT, no additional action is required of the provider. The payer also uses this code when a check is issued for the payment.
* `D` - Debit | The payer uses this code to indicate a debit to the payer's account and a credit to the provider's account, initiated by the provider at the instruction of the payer.

### Payment Method Code

This code is returned in the [`transactions.financialInformation.paymentMethodCode` property](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835#response-transactions-financial-information-payment-method-code). It identifies the payment format. Note that the remaining properties in the `financialInformation` object contain additional requirements and information about the payment.

<Accordion title="Payment Method Code list">
  * `ACH` - Automated Clearing House (ACH) | The payer uses this code to move money electronically through the ACH, or to notify the provider that an ACH transfer was requested.
  * `BOP` - Financial Institution Option | The payer uses this code to indicate that the third-party processor will choose the method of payment based upon endpoint requests or capabilities.
  * `CHK` -  Check | The payer uses this code to indicate that a check has been issued for payment.

  * `NON` - Non-Payment Data | The payer uses this code when the `transactions.financialInformation.transactionHandlingCode` is `H`, indicating that this is information only and no dollars are to be moved.
</Accordion>

### Transaction Handling Code

This code is returned in the [`transactions.financialInformation.transactionHandlingCode` property](/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-835#response-transactions-financial-information-transaction-handling-code). It indicates the actions taken by both the sender and the receiver.

<Accordion title="Transaction Handling Code list">
  * `C` - Payment Accompanies Remittance Advice | The payer uses this code to instruct the third-party processor to move funds and remittance details together through the banking system.
  * `D` - Make Payment Only | The payer uses this code to instruct the third-party processor to move only funds through the banking system and to ignore any remittance information.
  * `H` - Notification Only | The payer uses this code when the actual provider payment (listed in the `transactions.financialInformation.totalActualProviderPaymentAmount` property) is zero, and the transaction is not being used for Prenotification of Future Transfers. This indicates remittance information without any associated payment.
  * `I` - Remittance Information Only | The payer uses this code to indicate to the payee that the remittance detail is moving separately from the payment.
  * `P` - Prenotification of Future Transfers | This code is used only by the payer and the banking system to initially validate account numbers before beginning an EFT relationship.
  * `U` - Split Payment and Remittance | The payer uses this code to instruct the third-party processor to split the payment and remittance details and send each on a separate path.
  * `X` - Handling Party's Option to Split Payment and Remittance | The payer uses this code to instruct the third-party processor to move the payment and remittance detail, together or separately, based upon endpoint requests or capabilities.

# Sandbox accounts
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/sandbox-account



A sandbox account is a test environment where you can explore integrating with Stedi Clearinghouse. It allows you to realistically simulate transactions without PHI/PII and evaluate Stedi's functionality without sending any data to payers.

You can [create a sandbox account](https://portal.stedi.com/auth/sign-up?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stedi.com%2Fapp%2Fcreate-sandbox) in under five minutes for free without talking to our team or entering any payment information. When you're ready, [contact customer support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) to upgrade your account to a paid plan and start sending production data.

<Tip>
  Mock transactions you send in the sandbox environment are free for testing
  purposes and won’t incur any charges from Stedi.
</Tip>

## Send mock eligibility checks

You can submit mock real-time eligibility checks through the manual [eligibility check form](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/checks/create). You can choose from a variety of predefined requests for well-known payers, including:

* Aetna
* Cigna
* UnitedHealthcare
* National Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
* Many more - Visit [Eligibility mock requests](/api-reference/healthcare/mock-requests-eligibility-checks) for a complete list

Stedi returns a realistic mock benefits response for the payer so you can get a sense for the kinds of data you'll receive in production.

## Review eligibility check results

After you submit a mock eligibility check, you can review all of the request and response details in [Eligibility Manager](/healthcare/eligibility-manager). This includes:

* A list of historical eligibility checks that you can filter by status, Payer ID, date, and error code.
* The raw API request and response.
* A user-friendly benefits view designed to help you quickly understand the patient's active coverage and payment responsibilities, such as co-pay and deductible amounts.
* Eligibility check **Debug** view, which allows you to to systematically troubleshoot failed checks until you receive a successful response from the payer.

## Explore the Stedi portal

The test environment allows you to get familiar with Stedi's UI tools and learn more about how you can use Stedi to automate claims and eligibility check workflows.


# Eligibility checks
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks



Real-time eligibility checks are ideal for in-person patient visits, telehealth appointments, and other scenarios where you need immediate information about a patient's coverage.

We recommend always starting with real-time checks when integrating with a new payer. This approach allows you to quickly test and refine your pipeline through fast feedback loops. Once you're comfortable with real-time checks, you may also want to start sending asynchronous batch checks to perform periodic refreshes for all or a subset of patients.

You can send real-time eligibility checks to payers manually through the Stedi portal or programmatically through the API. The synchronous response includes the patient's complete benefits information, such as coverage status, co-pays, and deductibles.

<Tip>
  Eligibility checks verify coverage with a specific payer. If you don't know
  the payer, you can perform an [insurance discovery
  check](/healthcare/insurance-discovery) instead to find a patient's coverage
  using their demographic data.
</Tip>

## Transaction enrollment

Some payers require [transaction enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) before you can start sending them eligibility checks. The [Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network) specifies which payers require enrollment.

## Manual submission

Manual eligibility checks can be useful for testing and for situations when you need to do a one-time eligibility check.

Go to the [Create manual eligibility check](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/checks/create) page in the Stedi portal to submit manual eligibility checks and review the full JSON response. You can also sort and filter a more user-friendly response organized by coverage type and level.

## API submission

Call one of the following endpoints to send 270 eligibility checks to payers:

* [Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) to send requests in JSON
* [Eligibility Check Raw X12](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility-raw-x12) to send requests in X12 EDI

Stedi automatically applies various repairs to help your requests meet X12 HIPAA specifications, resulting in fewer payer rejections.

### Headers

You must include the following Stedi-specific headers in your API request:

* **`Authorization`:** [Generate an API key](/api-reference/index#authentication) to use for authentication.
* **`Content-Type`:** Set to `application/json`.

```json
curl --request POST \
  --url https://healthcare.us.stedi.com/2024-04-01/change/medicalnetwork/eligibility/v3 \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

### Body

The information you provide to the payer in an eligibility check can vary, depending on the circumstances. You can review a list of all possible request fields in the [Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) endpoint documentation.

However, each eligibility check must include the following information in the request body:

| Information                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `controlNumber`                                | An integer used to identify the transaction. It does not need to be globally unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `tradingPartnerServiceId`                      | You can find the payer ID in our list of [supported payers](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network). If you don't know the payer, try submitting an [insurance discovery check](/healthcare/insurance-discovery) instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `provider` object, name                        | You must include the provider's name - either the `firstName` and `lastName` of a specific provider within a practice or the `organizationName`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `provider` object, identifier                  | You must include an identifier. Most often this is the [National Provider Identifier (NPI)](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `subscriber` and/or `dependents` objects       | At a minimum, our API requires that you supply at least one of these fields in the request: `memberId`, `dateOfBirth`, or `lastName`. However, each payer has different requirements, so you should supply the fields necessary for each payer to identify the subscriber in their system. When all four of `memberId`, `dateOfBirth`, `firstName`, and `lastName` are provided, payers are required to return a response if the member is in their database. Some payers may be able to search with less information, but this varies by payer. We recommend always including the patient's member ID when possible. Learn more about [patient information](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#patient-information). |
| `encounter` object, service dates              | You can specify either a single `dateOfService` or a `beginningDateOfService` and `endDateOfService`. The payer defaults to using the current date in their timezone if you don't include one. We recommend submitting dates up to 12 months in the past or up to the end of the current month. Dates outside of these ranges are likely to be rejected by many payers, since they may have archived older data and they cannot guarantee eligibility for future months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `encounter` object, service or procedure codes | Specify `serviceTypeCodes` and/or a `procedureCode` and `productOrServiceIDQualifier` to request specific types of benefits information. We don't know which payers support multiple service type codes, so we recommend including no more than one in each request. If you do not include any of these fields, Stedi defaults to using `30` (Plan coverage and general benefits) as the only `serviceTypeCodes` value. Learn more about [checking eligibility for specific services](/healthcare/send-eligibility-checks#checking-eligibility-for-specific-services).                                                                                                                                                 |

The following example shows the bare minimum request body for an eligibility check. Because the `dateOfService` is not specified, the payer will use the current date in their timezone (default) to retrieve benefits information.

```json
{
  "controlNumber": "123456789",
  "tradingPartnerServiceId": "AHS",
  "encounter": {
    "serviceTypeCodes": ["78"]
  },
  "provider": {
    "organizationName": "ACME Health Services",
    "npi": "1999999984"
  },
  "subscriber": {
    "dateOfBirth": "19000101",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "memberId": "1234567890"
  }
}
```

#### Character restrictions

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

In addition, the following characters are reserved for delimiters in the final X12 EDI transaction to the payer: `~`, `*`, `:`, and `^`. X12 doesn’t support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you use these restricted characters improperly.

* **JSON endpoint:** Don’t include delimiter characters anywhere in your request data.
* **Raw X12 endpoint:** You can use these characters as delimiters, but not in the body of the request data.

### Sample request and response

The following request and response examples show a basic eligibility check for a patient named Jane Doe. The request uses the `MH` service type code to check for mental health benefits. It also includes the `patientId`, which is a unique identifier Stedi uses to identify and correlate historical eligibility checks for the same individual.

Visit [Determine patient benefits](/healthcare/eligibility-active-coverage-benefits) for details about how you can use the benefits response to determine a patient's coverage status and benefits.

## Send mock requests

When you submit specific mock requests to the Eligibility Check endpoint, Stedi returns mock benefits data from the specified payer you can use for testing. Visit [Send mock requests](/api-reference/healthcare/mock-requests-eligibility-checks) for a complete list of mock requests you can send.

You can also manually submit mock requests in the Stedi portal by enabling **Test mode**. Visit [Test mode](/healthcare/test-mode) for more details.

## Patient information

All payers are required to be able to search for patients using the following "bare minimum" subsets of information. They will return benefits information as long as they can find a unique match for the patient within their system.

For a subscriber:

* Member ID, first name, last name, date of birth
* Member ID, last name, date of birth
* Member ID, first name, last name

For a dependent:

* Subscriber member ID (in the `subscriber` object), first name, last name, date of birth
* Subscriber member ID, last name, date of birth
* Subscriber member ID, first name, last name

Of course, not all of this patient information is always available. For example, a patient may forget their ID card. In these instances, some payers may still be able to search with even less information, such as the patient's first name, last name, and date of birth. Contact us if you have questions about alternative search options for a particular payer.

### Dependents

The patient qualifies as a dependent for eligibility checks when:

1. The patient is listed as a dependent on the subscriber's insurance plan.
2. The payer cannot uniquely identify the patient through information outside the subscriber's policy.

For example, if the dependent has their own member ID number in the payer's database, you must identify them in the `subscriber` object instead.

### Patient names

Note the following information and best practices when entering patient names:

* Enter the name exactly as written on the patient's insurance ID card (if available), including any special or punctuation characters such as apostrophes, hyphens (dashes), or spaces. If the patient's insurance ID card isn't available, enter the name exactly as written on a government-issued ID card. If a government ID card isn't available, enter the name exactly as given by the patient.
* Don't include a name prefix, title, rank, honorific, or academic degree in any property. These include Mrs., Dr., Hon., and PhD.
* Don't include a suffix or generation such as Jr. or III in the `firstName` or `lastName` property. Put it in the separate `suffix` property instead. Payers are supposed to automatically parse suffixes out of the last name, but Stedi can't guarantee that all payers will do this correctly.
* You can populate a middle name (or names) or initial in the `middleName` property, but most payers ignore it when searching for the patient.
* Case doesn't matter. For example, JANE is equivalent to Jane.

The following are supported for patient names:

* Compound last and first names separated by spaces or hyphens such as Jean‐Claude or Smith Jones
* Apostrophized or elided names such as O’Connor or D’Amore
* Numbers like 3, however this typically indicates a data entry error

Some payers may have more specific requirements or restrictions that we don't cover in our docs. If you're receiving errors for a specific payer, we recommend consulting that payer's documentation for eligibility checks for additional guidance.

### MBI for CMS checks

A Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) is a unique, randomly-generated identifier assigned to individuals enrolled in Medicare. You must include the patient’s MBI in every eligibility check to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Payer ID: CMS).

Some payers return the patient's MBI in one of the following properties of the standard eligibility response:

* [`benefitsInformation.benefitsAdditionalInformation.hicNumber`](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility#response-benefits-information-benefits-additional-information-hic-number)
* [`planInformation.hicNumber`](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility#response-plan-information-hic-number)

If the value in either of these properties matches the format specified in the [Medicare Beneficiary Identifier documentation](https://www.cms.gov/training-education/partner-outreach-resources/new-medicare-card/medical-beneficiary-identifiers-mbis), the number is likely an MBI, and we recommend sending a follow-up eligibility check to CMS for additional benefits data. You're most likely to receive an MBI in eligibility check responses from commercial Medicare Advantage plans, but they can also be present in responses from Medicaid plans for dual-eligible patients.

When you don't know a patient's MBI, you can use Stedi's eligibility check APIs to perform an MBI lookup using their Social Security Number instead. Stedi returns a complete benefits response from CMS with the patient's MBI in the `subscriber` object for future reference. Visit [Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) lookup
](/healthcare/mbi-lookup) for complete details.

## Checking eligibility for specific services

You may need to determine whether a patient’s insurance covers particular medical or dental services, such as chiropractic or hospice care.

Technically, you can request specific types of benefits information from the payer by including either a `procedureCode` and `productOrServiceIDQualifier` or a `serviceTypeCodes` value in the `encounter` object. In practice, most payers don't support procedure codes (CPT/HCPCS/CDT), so you will almost always need to submit a service type code (STC) in your eligibility check.

### Mapping procedure codes

It can be hard to map procedure codes to the right STC. For example, if a provider offers medical nutrition therapy and bills using CPT code 97802, should they use service type code `1` - Medical Care, `3` - Consultation, `MH` - Mental Health, or another option?

Unfortunately, there's no standardized mapping between procedure codes and STCs. In fact, payers themselves often don't have an explicit mapping for their own health plans. Their eligibility check systems aren't necessarily directly integrated with their claims processing systems, so when you ask them which STC to use, they may not always be able to provide a good answer.

Figuring out the best service type codes to use requires some trial and error, and you'll need to maintain an internal document that contains the mappings for the health plans you most frequently bill. Here's our recommended approach:

* Review the payers' documentation for eligibility checks. Some payers provide a list of STCs they support and their mappings to procedure codes.
* If you can't find the information in the payer's documentation, contact the payer directly or reach out to [Stedi support](https://www.stedi.com/contact), and we'll contact the payer for you.
* For dental payers that don’t support specific CDT codes, you can use Table 6 in the American Dental Association's [Technical Report No. 1102](https://engage.ada.org/p/eg/ada-technical-report-no-1102-electronic-dental-benefits-eligibility-verification-e-book-1390?itm_source=pp-1316\&itm_component=p-related) to map CDT codes to service type codes. You can either purchase a copy of the report or contact Stedi support for recommendations about specific mappings.
* If none of the above methods work, you can ask a medical coder with [AAPC certification](https://www.aapc.com/certifications) for guidance. Their familiarity with billable codes will help them make good recommendations about service type code mappings.

### Service Type Codes

You can include the following service type codes in the `encounter` object to request specific benefits information from the payer. Not all payers support all service type codes, however all payers are required to return benefits information for `30`(Plan coverage and general benefits).

Note that the word physician in service type codes refers to any healthcare provider, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other types of healthcare professionals.

## Timeout

Insurance payers may take up to 60 seconds to respond to a request, but Stedi holds real-time eligibility check requests open for up to 120 seconds before timing out. During this period, Stedi attempts multiple retries to payers in an effort to complete your request.

Canceling and retrying requests before Stedi's automatic retry period ends may create multiple ongoing requests to payers and increase your concurrency usage.

### Request hedging

When eligibility responses are taking too long, you can use request hedging to try to get results faster. To implement request hedging, send a second request at some internal duration cutoff (for example, 30 seconds) without cancelling the first request. Then, you can use whichever result comes back first. If one of the requests fails, you can wait for the second request to see if it's successful.

## Concurrency limit

Our real-time eligibility check endpoint has rate limiting on a per-account basis. This limit is based on *concurrent* requests, not requests per second. The default rate limit is 5 concurrent requests; if you need a higher limit, reach out to [Support](https://www.stedi.com/contact).

Your transactions per second (and thus your concurrency limit) will vary based on the payer response time. If you reach the maximum concurrency limit, Stedi rejects additional requests with a `429` HTTP code until one of your previous requests is completed. Rejected requests have the following error message:

```
{
  "message": "The request can't be submitted because the sender's submission has been throttled: CUSTOMER_LIMIT",
  "code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "eligibilitySearchId": "019249c7-e176-76b0-a46a-3aef1a519bc4"
}
```

Asynchronous [batch eligibility checks](/healthcare/batch-refresh-eligibility-checks) don’t count toward your Stedi account concurrency budget. This allows you to stage thousands of batch requests while continuing to send real-time requests.

## Avoid payer throttling

Payers expect to receive requests at a "human scale", such as a member entering insurance information into a website or presenting their insurance card at a doctor's office. They may throttle high volumes of requests for the same provider (NPI ID) at once. This throttling can occur even when you are within Stedi's concurrency limit.

Real-time requests during normal operations are unlikely to experience throttling. However, we recommend spacing out requests during testing and periodic "refresh" checks, such as verifying active insurance. Avoid hitting payers with the same NPI ID more than 1-2 times every 15 seconds.

You can also use Stedi’s [Batch Eligibility Check API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-batch-eligibility) to submit up to 500 eligibility checks in a single request. Stedi processes these eligibility checks asynchronously, implementing best practices to avoid payer throttling.


# Submit claims through SFTP
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/submit-claims-sftp-connection



You can use Stedi's fully-managed SFTP server to submit claims to payers and retrieve claim responses without calling Stedi's APIs.

You must submit claims in X12 EDI format, and Stedi returns claim responses through the SFTP connection in X12 EDI format. This makes Stedi SFTP a good option if you have an existing system that generates X12 EDI files and you want to send them through Stedi Clearinghouse without completing an API integration.

## How SFTP connections work

Use the following process to submit claims to Stedi:

1. Create SFTP users through the [Healthcare](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/healthcare) page in your account. You'll use these credentials to connect to Stedi's SFTP server.
2. Connect to Stedi's server and drop X12 EDI claim files into the `to-stedi` directory.
3. Stedi automatically validates the claim data and uses the Interchange Usage Indicator field (`T` or `P`) to determine whether each file contains a test or a production claim. If there are no validation errors, Stedi routes your claims to the test or production clearinghouse accordingly.
4. Stedi places claim responses - 277 Claim Acknowledgments and 835 ERAs - into the `from-stedi` directory in X12 EDI format. You can retrieve these responses from the directory at your preferred cadence without setting up webhooks or calling Stedi's APIs.

Stedi shows all claims and claim responses sent through the SFTP connection on the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) and [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) pages in the UI. This allows you to review your claim submissions, quickly find related responses, and download transaction data.

## Before sending claims

You may need to complete the following steps before sending claims.

### Transaction enrollment

All payers require providers to complete an enrollment process before they can start receiving claim remittances (ERAs). Some payers also require enrollment before allowing providers to submit claims.

The [Stedi Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network) lists which payers require transaction enrollment. Visit [Transaction Enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) for details about the transaction enrollment process.

### Coordination of benefits check (recommended)

We recommend running a coordination of benefits (COB) check to ensure you submit claims to the correct payer. COB checks can help you determine:

* If a patient is covered by more than one health plan
* Whether coverage overlap requires coordination of benefits
* Each payer’s responsibility for payment (primacy) in coordination of benefits scenarios

Visit [Coordination of benefits (COB) checks](/healthcare/coordination-of-benefits) for more information.

## Create SFTP users

Go to the [Healthcare](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/healthcare) page in your account settings to create SFTP users.

You can create either test or production users.

* Test users can only send claims with the Usage Indicator Code set to `T` (test). These claims are only sent to Stedi's test clearinghouse and not to the payer. Note that you will receive a 277 Claim Acknowledgment for test claims, but you will not receive an 835 ERA.
* Production users can only send claims with the Usage Indicator Code set to `P` (production). These claims are sent through Stedi's production clearinghouse to the payer.

## Connect to Stedi's server

Use your user credentials to connect to Stedi's SFTP server at `transfer.us.stedi.com` using Port 22.

### Static IPs

You can use these static IP addresses to allowlist Stedi's server:
`18.119.51.218` and `18.206.132.233`

## Format X12 EDI claims

You must drop claims into the `to-stedi` directory in X12 EDI format. Stedi validates the claims and routes them to the appropriate clearinghouse based on the `ISA15` Interchange Usage Indicator field.

Claims must adhere to the following X12 HIPAA claim specifications:

* [Health Care Claim: Professional (X222A1)](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-claim-professional-x222a1/01HR60MDFAGCSEJNKY8J38867Y)
* [Health Care Claim: Institutional (X223A2)](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-claim-institutional-x223a2/01JBHW2YXMN2F9KXK2PS0BFP9F)
* [Health Care Claim: Dental (X224A2)](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-claim-dental-x224a2/01JCJZ46AEK835RYV1BXQNBPK8)

We recommend submitting one claim per file to make troubleshooting easier. However, an EDI Interchange can contain multiple transactions, so you can submit multiple claims within a single file if needed. Regardless of how many claims you submit in a file, Stedi processes each claim individually and returns each claim response as a separate file.

### EDI envelope

You must use specific values in certain `ISA`, `GS`, and `ST` header elements to ensure that Stedi can process your claims correctly. For example, you must use specific values for the sender and receiver IDs (`ISA06` and `ISA08`).

The required values differ depending on whether you are sending test or production claims. For example, the `ISA08` value for test claims is `STEDITEST`, while the value for production claims is just `STEDI`.

Stedi displays the exact header values you need to use for each use case on the [Healthcare](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/healthcare) page in your account settings.

<Warning>
  Your SFTP user type **must** match the claim type, as indicated by the value
  (`T` or `P`) in `ISA15`. If you try to send a test claim with production user
  credentials, Stedi returns an error. Likewise, if you try to send a production
  claim with test user credentials, Stedi returns an error.
</Warning>

## Set up webhooks (recommended)

Stedi emits events when it processes claims and claim responses.

* **File delivered:** Emitted when Stedi successfully processes your claim and delivers it to our connection with the payer. Note that this event doesn’t indicate whether the payer received the claim or whether they have accepted or rejected it.
* **File failed:** Emitted when Stedi cannot deliver the claim to the payer due to validation errors in the X12 EDI claim data. You must fix the errors and resubmit the claim.
* **Transaction processed:** Emitted when Stedi successfully receives and processes a payer or intermediary clearinghouse response, such as an 835 ERA. These events are also emitted when Stedi successfully processes claims you submit through the SFTP connection.

We recommend setting up [webhooks](/healthcare/configure-webhooks) for at least file failed events so you can monitor for claim submission errors. Otherwise, your claim submissions may silently fail, and it will be much more difficult to troubleshoot issues.

## Send claims and retrieve responses

You can drop claims into the `to-stedi` directory. Stedi automatically validates the claim data and then routes each claim to the appropriate clearinghouse (test or production). Stedi deletes files from the `to-stedi` directory after processing them to avoid duplicate claim submissions.

After submitting a claim, you may receive [277 Claim Acknowledgment](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/claim-acknowledgment-x214/01HACJ4MNFWR3GV3BCVAMG04PK) and the [835 Health Care Claim Payment/Advice (ERA)](https://portal.stedi.com/app/guides/view/hipaa/health-care-claim-paymentadvice-x221a1/01GRYB6DS30MGXWBPFZCM3695E) responses in X12 EDI format. You can retrieve these claim responses at your preferred cadence from the `from-stedi` directory.

### Claim Acknowledgment (277CA)

The 277CA indicates whether the claim was accepted or rejected and (if relevant) the reasons for rejection. Though it can contain claim status information, the 277CA is different from the synchronous 277 Claim Status response you receive after submitting a [real-time claim status](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claim-status) request.

You may receive multiple separate 277CAs for each claim you submit.

* You'll receive the first 277CA from Stedi within about 30 minutes of submitting the claim. This 277 may contain rejection message(s) and warnings, if applicable.
* You may receive additional 277CAs from intermediary clearinghouses.
* You'll receive one or more 277CAs from the payer. Typically, there is one 277CA that indicates receipt of the claim and a second 277CA that contains summary counts of transactions received, information about accepted transactions, and details for rejected transactions.

You can determine whether a 277CA is from a clearinghouse or the payer from the [`transactions.payers` array](https://www.stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/get-healthcare-reports-277#response-transactions-payers) in the report. The `organizationName` property contains the name of the sender (for example, `CIGNA`) and the `identityIdentifierCodeValue` contains either `Clearinghouse` or `Payer`.

This information is also available at the top of the 277CA's [transaction details page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) in the Stedi portal.

### Electronic Remittance Advice (835 ERA)

The 835 ERA, also known as a claim payment, contains details about payments for specific services and explanations for any adjustments or denials.

<Tip>
  Processing 835 ERAs almost always requires [enrollment](/healthcare/supported-payers#enrollment) with the payer.
</Tip>

## Correlate responses with claim

You can use the following identifiers from the original claim to correlate the 277CA and 835 ERA responses.

### Entire claim

Use Loop 2300 `CLM01` (Patient Control Number) from the original claim, if provided.

* In the 277CA response, this number is returned as Loop 2200D `TRN02` (Patient Control Number).
* In the 835 response, this number is returned as Loop 2100 `CLP01` (Patient Control Number).

### Specific service lines

Use Loop 2400 `REF02` (Line Item Control Number) from the original claim, if provided.

Location in responses:

* In the 277CA response, this number is sometimes returned as Loop 2220D `REF02` (Line Item Control Number). This is because a 277CA only contains a Service Line Information Loop if it was rejected because of issues with the information provided for the service line.
* In the 835 response, this number is returned as Loop 2110 `REF02` (Line Item Control Number).


# Submit dental claims
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/submit-dental-claims



You can send 837D (Dental) claims to payers through Stedi's API or SFTP connection.

Once you send a claim, Stedi automatically receives and processes 277 Claim Acknowledgment (277CA) and 835 Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) responses.

## Before sending claims

You may need to complete the following steps before sending claims.

### Transaction enrollment

All payers require providers to complete an enrollment process before they can start receiving claim remittances (ERAs). Some payers also require enrollment before allowing providers to submit claims.

The [Stedi Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network) lists which payers require transaction enrollment. Visit [Transaction Enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) for details about the transaction enrollment process.

### Coordination of benefits check (recommended)

We recommend running a coordination of benefits (COB) check to ensure you submit claims to the correct payer. COB checks can help you determine:

* If a patient is covered by more than one health plan
* Whether coverage overlap requires coordination of benefits
* Each payer’s responsibility for payment (primacy) in coordination of benefits scenarios

Visit [Coordination of benefits (COB) checks](/healthcare/coordination-of-benefits) for more information.

## SFTP submission

You can use Stedi’s fully-managed SFTP server to submit claims to to payers and retrieve claim responses without calling Stedi’s APIs.

You must submit claims in X12 EDI format, and Stedi returns claim responses through the SFTP connection in X12 EDI format. This makes Stedi SFTP a good option if you have an existing system that generates X12 EDI files and you want to send them through Stedi clearinghouse without completing an API integration. Visit [SFTP connection](/healthcare/submit-claims-sftp-connection) for more information.

## API submission

Call one of the following endpoints to submit 837 dental claims:

* [Dental Claims](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-dental-claims) to send requests in JSON
* [Dental Claims Raw X12](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-dental-claims-raw-x12) to send requests in X12 EDI

The endpoint returns a synchronous response from Stedi in JSON format. Later, the payer will respond with a Claim Acknowledgment (277CA).

### Headers

When constructing the request, you must include the following information in HTTP headers:

* **`Authorization`:** [Generate an API key](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/api-keys) to use for authentication.
* **`Content-Type`:** Set to `application/json`.

### Body

The information you submit for a claim depends on your use case. Refer to the [Dental Claims](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-dental-claims) endpoint for a complete list of properties. However, all claims require the following high-level information:

| Information                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Character restrictions

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

In addition, the following characters are reserved for delimiters in the final X12 EDI transaction to the payer: `~`, `*`, `:`, and `^`. X12 doesn’t support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you use these restricted characters improperly.

* **JSON endpoint:** Don’t include delimiter characters anywhere in your request data.
* **Raw X12 endpoint:** You can use these characters as delimiters, but not in the body of the request data.

#### Identify service lines

A claim can contain multiple service lines. Since the payer may accept, reject, or pay a subset of those lines, you can receive an 835 response that references a `patientControlNumber`, but only pertains to some of the service lines.

However, the `claimInformation.serviceLines.providerControlNumber` serves as a unique identifier for each service line in your claim submission. This value appears in the 277CA and 835 ERA responses as the `lineItemControlNumber`, allowing you to correlate these responses to specific service lines from the original claim. If you don't set the `providerControlNumber` for a service line, Stedi uses a random UUID.

Stedi returns service line identifiers in the `claimReference.serviceLines` object of the synchronous API response.

## Test claims

All claims you submit through this endpoint are sent to the payer as production claims unless you explicitly designate them as test data.

To send test claims, set the `usageIndicator` property in the test claim body to `T`. This allows you to filter for test claims on the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page in the Stedi portal.

Note that you will receive a 277 Claim Acknowledgment in response to test claims, allowing you to test your workflow end to end, but you will not receive a test 835 (ERA) response.

## Cancel or resubmit claims

You may need to resubmit claims for several reasons, including changes to the patient's coverage, errors in the original claim's information, or appealing a denied claim. You may also need to cancel duplicate claims or claims that were submitted in error.

We recommend the following for resubmitting or canceling claims:

* **Correct or replace claims:** Set `claimInformation.claimFrequencyCode` to `7` - Replacement of Prior Claim. We also recommend setting a new, unique `patientControlNumber`. The payer includes this value in their 835 ERA response, allowing you to easily correlate that response with your resubmission.
* **Cancel claims :** Set `claimInformation.claimFrequencyCode` to `8` - Void/Cancel of Prior Claim.

<Tip>
  Choosing the correct claim filing indicator code is important for successful
  claim submission. Visit the [Claims code
  lists](/healthcare/claims-code-lists#choosing-the-right-code) documentation
  for best practices for selecting the appropriate code.
</Tip>

In both cases, identify the original claim by setting `claimInformation.claimSupplementalInformation.claimControlNumber` to the Payer Claim Control Number (sometimes called the ICN). This is different from the `patientControlNumber` you sent in the claim and the Stedi-generated `controlNumber` returned in the API response. You can retrieve the Payer Claim Control Number from one of the payer's 277 responses under the key `transactions.payers.claimStatusTransactions.claimStatusDetails.patientClaimStatusDetails.claims.claimStatus.tradingPartnerClaimNumber`.

## View submitted claims

You can view the files that Stedi sends and receives in the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page of the Stedi portal.

On the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page, you can review and filter claims by **Usage** - production or test. Click any claim submission to review its details, including the full request and response payload and processing events.


# Submit institutional claims
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/submit-institutional-claims



You can send 837I (Institutional) claims to payers through Stedi's API or SFTP connection.

Once you send a claim, Stedi automatically receives and processes 277 Claim Acknowledgment (277CA) and 835 Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) responses.

## Before sending claims

You may need to complete the following steps before sending claims.

### Transaction enrollment

All payers require providers to complete an enrollment process before they can start receiving claim remittances (ERAs). Some payers also require enrollment before allowing providers to submit claims.

The [Stedi Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network) lists which payers require transaction enrollment. Visit [Transaction Enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) for details about the transaction enrollment process.

### Coordination of benefits check (recommended)

We recommend running a coordination of benefits (COB) check to ensure you submit claims to the correct payer. COB checks can help you determine:

* If a patient is covered by more than one health plan
* Whether coverage overlap requires coordination of benefits
* Each payer’s responsibility for payment (primacy) in coordination of benefits scenarios

Visit [Coordination of benefits (COB) checks](/healthcare/coordination-of-benefits) for more information.

## SFTP submission

You can use Stedi’s fully-managed SFTP server to submit claims to to payers and retrieve claim responses without calling Stedi’s APIs.

You must submit claims in X12 EDI format, and Stedi returns claim responses through the SFTP connection in X12 EDI format. This makes Stedi SFTP a good option if you have an existing system that generates X12 EDI files and you want to send them through Stedi clearinghouse without completing an API integration. Visit [SFTP connection](/healthcare/submit-claims-sftp-connection) for more information.

## API submission

Call the [Institutional Claims](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-institutional-claims) endpoint to submit 837I institutional claims in JSON.

The endpoint returns a synchronous response from Stedi in JSON format. Later, Stedi will respond with Claim Acknowledgments (277CA), and the payer will respond with Claim Acknowledgments (277CA) and the ERA (835).

### Headers

When constructing the request, you must include the following information in HTTP headers:

* **`Authorization`:** [Generate an API key](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/api-keys) to use for authentication.
* **`Content-Type`:** Set to `application/json`.

### Body

The information you submit for a claim depends on your use case. Refer to the [Institutional Claims](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-institutional-claims) endpoint for a complete list of properties. However, all claims require the following high-level information:

| Information                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   |

</Tip>

#### Character restrictions

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

Don't include the following characters in your request data: `~`, `*`, `:` and `^`. They are reserved for delimiters in the resulting X12 EDI transaction, and X12 doesn't support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you include these restricted characters in your request.

#### Identify service lines

A claim can contain multiple service lines. Since the payer may accept, reject, or pay a subset of those lines, you can receive an 835 response that references a `patientControlNumber`, but only pertains to some of the service lines.

However, the `claimInformation.serviceLines.lineItemControlNumber` serves as a unique identifier for each service line in your claim submission. This value appears in the 277CA and 835 ERA responses as the `lineItemControlNumber`, allowing you to correlate these responses to specific service lines from the original claim. We strongly recommend setting the `lineItemControlNumber` to a ULID or other unique identifier for each service line. We recommend using a ULID instead of a UUID because the property has a max of 30 characters.

## Test claims

All claims you submit through this endpoint are sent to the payer as production claims unless you explicitly designate them as test data.

To send test claims, set the `usageIndicator` property in the test claim body to `T`. This allows you to filter for test claims on the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page in the Stedi portal.

Note that you will receive a 277 Claim Acknowledgment in response to test claims, allowing you to test your workflow end to end, but you will not receive a test 835 (ERA) response.

## Cancel or resubmit claims

You may need to resubmit claims for several reasons, including changes to the patient's coverage, errors in the original claim's information, or appealing a denied claim. You may also need to cancel duplicate claims or claims that were submitted in error.

We recommend the following for resubmitting or canceling claims:

* **Correct or replace claims:** Set `claimInformation.claimFrequencyCode` to `7` - Replacement of Prior Claim. We also recommend setting a new, unique `patientControlNumber`. The payer includes this value in their 835 ERA response, allowing you to easily correlate that response with your resubmission.
* **Cancel claims :** Set `claimInformation.claimFrequencyCode` to `8` - Void/Cancel of Prior Claim.

In both cases, identify the original claim by setting `claimInformation.claimSupplementalInformation.claimControlNumber` to the Payer Claim Control Number (sometimes called the ICN). This is different from the `patientControlNumber` you sent in the claim and the Stedi-generated `controlNumber` returned in the API response. You can retrieve the Payer Claim Control Number from one of the payer's 277 responses under the key `transactions.payers.claimStatusTransactions.claimStatusDetails.patientClaimStatusDetails.claims.claimStatus.tradingPartnerClaimNumber`.

## View submitted claims

You can view the files that Stedi sends and receives in the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page of the Stedi portal.

On the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page, you can review and filter claims by **Usage** - production or test. Click any claim submission to review its details, including the full request and response payload.


# Submit professional claims
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/submit-professional-claims



You can send 837P (Professional) claims to payers through the Stedi portal, the Professional Claims API, or an SFTP connection.

Once you send a claim, Stedi automatically receives and processes 277 Claim Acknowledgment (277CA) and 835 Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) responses.

## Before sending claims

You may need to complete the following steps before sending claims.

### Transaction enrollment

All payers require providers to complete an enrollment process before they can start receiving claim remittances (ERAs). Some payers also require enrollment before allowing providers to submit claims.

The [Stedi Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network) lists which payers require transaction enrollment. Visit [Transaction Enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) for details about the transaction enrollment process.

### Coordination of benefits check (recommended)

We recommend running a coordination of benefits (COB) check to ensure you submit claims to the correct payer. COB checks can help you determine:

* If a patient is covered by more than one health plan
* Whether coverage overlap requires coordination of benefits
* Each payer’s responsibility for payment (primacy) in coordination of benefits scenarios

Visit [Coordination of benefits (COB) checks](/healthcare/coordination-of-benefits) for more information.

## Manual submission

Manual claim submission can be useful for testing, QA, and debugging your pipeline. You can submit 837P professional claims manually through the [Create manual claim page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/claims/create) in the Stedi portal.

The in-app form is adapted from the CMS-1500 Claim Form. As you build the claim, Stedi validates provider NPIs, diagnosis codes, and other key information to reduce payer rejections. You can also review a live preview of the autogenerated JSON payload for the [Professional Claims API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims) to understand how the form relates to the request structure.

## SFTP submission

You can use Stedi’s fully-managed SFTP server to submit claims to to payers and retrieve claim responses without calling Stedi’s APIs.

You must submit claims in X12 EDI format, and Stedi returns claim responses through the SFTP connection in X12 EDI format. This makes Stedi SFTP a good option if you have an existing system that generates X12 EDI files and you want to send them through Stedi clearinghouse without completing an API integration. Visit [SFTP connection](/healthcare/submit-claims-sftp-connection) for more information.

## API submission

Call one of the following endpoints to submit 837 professional claims:

* [Professional Claims](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims) to send requests in JSON
* [Professional Claims Raw X12](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims-raw-x12) to send requests in X12 EDI

The endpoint returns a synchronous response from Stedi in JSON format. Later, the payer will respond with a Claim Acknowledgment (277CA).

### Headers

When constructing the request, you must include the following information in HTTP headers:

* **`Authorization`:** [Generate an API key](https://portal.stedi.com/app/settings/api-keys) to use for authentication.
* **`Content-Type`:** Set to `application/json`.

#### Enhanced validation

You can optionally set the `Stedi-Validation` header to `snip` for enhanced validation on your claim submission.

[Enhanced validation](/healthcare/enhanced-claim-validation) uses hundreds of additional *edits* (the industry term for validation rules) to increase claim acceptance rates. These include Strategic National Implementation Process (SNIP) validations. Stedi also automatically fixes common errors and monitors payer rejections to proactively build out new rules.

<Warning>
  There is an **additional cost per claim submission** when you use enhanced validation. Please reach out to support for access and pricing information.
</Warning>

### Body

The information you submit for a claim depends on your use case. Refer to the [Professional Claims](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-claims) endpoint for a complete list of properties. However, all claims require the following high-level information:

| Information                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `subscriber` and/or `dependent` objects | Information about the patient who received the medical services. Note that if a dependent has their own, unique member ID for their health plan, you should submit their information in the `subscriber` object and omit the `dependent` object from the request. You can check whether the dependent has a unique member ID by submitting an [Eligibility Check](/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) to the payer for the dependent. The payer will return the member ID in the `dependents.memberId` field, if present. |
| `claimInformation` object               | Information about the claim, such as the patient control number, claim charge amount, and place of service code. It also includes information about each individual service line included in the claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

<Tip>
  Choosing the correct claim filing indicator code is important for successful
  claim submission. Visit the [Claims code
  lists](/healthcare/claims-code-lists#choosing-the-right-code) documentation
  for best practices for selecting the appropriate code.
</Tip>

#### Character restrictions

Only use the X12 Basic and Extended character sets in request data. Using characters outside these sets may cause validation and HTTP `400` errors.

<Accordion title="Basic character set">
  The X12 Basic character set includes uppercase letters, digits, space, and some special characters. Lowercase letters and special language characters like `ñ` are not included.

  The following special characters are included:

  ![Basic special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/basic-special-characters.png)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended character set">
  The Extended character set includes the characters listed in Basic, plus lowercase letters and additional special characters, such as `@`.

  The following additional special characters are included:
  ![Extended special characters](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stediinc/images/extended-special-characters-healthcare.png)
</Accordion>

In addition, the following characters are reserved for delimiters in the final X12 EDI transaction to the payer: `~`, `*`, `:`, and `^`. X12 doesn’t support using escape sequences to represent delimiters or special characters. Stedi returns a `400` error if you use these restricted characters improperly.

* **JSON endpoint:** Don’t include delimiter characters anywhere in your request data.
* **Raw X12 endpoint:** You can use these characters as delimiters, but not in the body of the request data.

#### Identify service lines

A claim can contain multiple service lines. Since the payer may accept, reject, or pay a subset of those lines, you can receive an 835 response that references a `patientControlNumber`, but only pertains to some of the service lines.

However, the `claimInformation.serviceLines.providerControlNumber` serves as a unique identifier for each service line in your claim submission. This value appears in the 277CA and 835 ERA responses as the `lineItemControlNumber`, allowing you to correlate these responses to specific service lines from the original claim. If you don't set the `providerControlNumber` for a service line, Stedi uses a random UUID.

Stedi returns service line identifiers in the `claimReference.serviceLines` object of the synchronous API response.

## Test claims

All claims you submit through this endpoint are sent to the payer as production claims unless you explicitly designate them as test data.

To send test claims, set the `usageIndicator` property in the test claim body to `T`. This allows you to filter for test claims on the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page in the Stedi portal.

Note that you will receive a 277 Claim Acknowledgment in response to test claims, allowing you to test your workflow end to end, but you will not receive a test 835 (ERA) response.

## Cancel or resubmit claims

You may need to resubmit claims for several reasons, including changes to the patient's coverage, errors in the original claim's information, or appealing a denied claim. You may also need to cancel duplicate claims or claims that were submitted in error.

We recommend the following for resubmitting or canceling claims:

* **Correct or replace claims:** Set `claimInformation.claimFrequencyCode` to `7` - Replacement of Prior Claim. We also recommend setting a new, unique `patientControlNumber`. The payer includes this value in their 835 ERA response, allowing you to easily correlate that response with your resubmission.
* **Cancel claims :** Set `claimInformation.claimFrequencyCode` to `8` - Void/Cancel of Prior Claim.

In both cases, identify the original claim by setting `claimInformation.claimSupplementalInformation.claimControlNumber` to the Payer Claim Control Number (sometimes called the ICN). This is different from the `patientControlNumber` you sent in the claim and the Stedi-generated `controlNumber` returned in the API response. You can retrieve the Payer Claim Control Number from one of the payer's 277 responses under the key `transactions.payers.claimStatusTransactions.claimStatusDetails.patientClaimStatusDetails.claims.claimStatus.tradingPartnerClaimNumber`.

## View submitted claims

You can view the files that Stedi sends and receives in the [Files](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/file-executions) page of the Stedi portal.

On the [Transactions](https://portal.stedi.com/app/core/transactions) page, you can review and filter claims by **Usage** - production or test. Click any claim submission to review its details, including the full request and response payload, processing events, and a link to download the auto-generated 1500 Claim Form PDF.

## Setting a claim's correlation ID

A claim's correlation ID is a business identifier that you can use to track and manage claims.

* When you submit claims through the JSON endpoint, Stedi generates the correlation ID for you, and this value will be unique for each claim.
* When you submit claims in X12 EDI through the API or an [SFTP connection](/healthcare/submit-claims-sftp-connection), you can specify your own correlation ID in the `BHT03` field. This allows you to use the same value for multiple claims if desired.

## CMS-1500 claim form PDF

Stedi automatically generates a PDF [CMS-1500 claim form](https://www.nucc.org/index.php/1500-claim-form-mainmenu-35) for each professional claim you submit. You can manually download the form on the transaction details page for the claim in Stedi or retrieve them programmatically through the following endpoints:

* [CMS-1500 PDF: Business Identifier](/api-reference/healthcare/get-pdf-1500-business-identifier): Retrieve PDFs through a claim's business identifier. You can find the business identifier value in the `claimReference.correlationId` property Stedi returns in the synchronous claim submission response.
* [CMS-1500 PDF: Transaction ID
  ](/api-reference/healthcare/get-pdf-1500): Retrieve PDFs through the `transactionId` Stedi assigns to the processed claim. This ID is included in the transaction processed event for the claim, which you can receive automatically through [webhooks](/healthcare/configure-webhooks). You can also retrieve this ID from the transaction's details page in Stedi.

Payers have strict requirements for submitted CMS-1500 claim forms. If you plan to send generated PDFs to payers or retain them for your records, we strongly recommend visiting [CMS-1500 Claim Form PDF](/healthcare/cms-1500-claim-form-pdf) for information about how to structure claim submissions for optimal generation, the correct printer settings for generated PDFs, and general best practices.


# Supported payers
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/supported-payers



Visit the [Stedi Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network) to review a complete list of supported payers for eligibility and claims processing. In the network, you can:

* Search for payers using their name, aliases, or Payer ID.
* Find the Payer IDs you need to send transactions through Stedi's APIs.
* Determine which payers require [transaction enrollment](/healthcare/transaction-enrollment) before you can begin exchanging transactions.

## Alternative names

The Payer Network includes alternative names for many payers. These additional names help you search for and identify payers using the name most familiar to your organization. For example, “Eaton Benefits Ohio” is an alternative associated with “Cigna”—searching for either name returns the same payer within the database.

## Payer IDs

The Payer Network includes three types of Payer IDs. You can use any of these IDs to send transactions through Stedi.

### Primary Payer ID

The primary Payer ID is the most commonly used ID for a payer and most often corresponds to the name the payer uses internally and provides to patients on member ID cards.

### Stedi Payer ID

The Stedi Payer ID is a unique identifier Stedi assigns to each payer. This ID is will not change, even if the primary Payer ID is updated. We maintain a list of Stedi Payer IDs to ensure that 1) you can always refer to a payer using a consistent identifier, 2) we can more easily route requests to the payer through the most reliable connection behind the scenes, and 3) we can update our products without introducing breaking changes.

You may want to use the Stedi Payer ID for requests if you are building a system that requires a consistent and immutable set of Payer IDs.

### Aliases

These are alternative IDs associated with a payer. If a payer changes their primary Payer ID, aliases ensure that customers who still refer to the old ID can find the payer and continue sending transactions to the payer uninterrupted. Some payers also have different Payer IDs for different plans, and aliases ensure that requests using these IDs are routed to the same payer.

## Stedi payer errors

Stedi returns the following error messages when a payer is not supported or enrolled properly.

# Test mode
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/test-mode



Test mode provides a separate test environment where you can realistically simulate transactions in your Stedi account without PHI/PII and without sending any data to payers.

You can access test mode in your account at any time by toggling **Test mode** to **ON**.

<Tip>
  Mock transactions you send in test mode are free for testing purposes and won’t incur any charges from Stedi.
</Tip>

## Send mock eligibility checks

You can submit mock real-time eligibility checks through the manual [eligibility check form](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/checks/create). You can choose from a variety of predefined requests for well-known payers, including:

* Aetna
* Cigna
* UnitedHealthcare
* National Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
* Many more - Visit [Eligibility mock requests](/api-reference/healthcare/mock-requests-eligibility-checks) for a complete list

Stedi returns a realistic mock benefits response for the payer so you can get a sense for the kinds of data you'll receive in production.

## Review eligibility check results

After you submit a mock eligibility check, you can review all of the request and response details in [Eligibility Manager](/healthcare/eligibility-manager). This includes:

* A list of historical eligibility checks that you can filter by status, Payer ID, date, and error code.
* The raw API request and response.
* A user-friendly benefits view designed to help you quickly understand the patient's active coverage and payment responsibilities, such as co-pay and deductible amounts.
* Eligibility check **Debug** view, which allows you to to systematically troubleshoot failed checks until you receive a successful response from the payer.

## Explore the Stedi portal

The test environment allows you to get familiar with Stedi's UI tools and learn more about how you can use Stedi to automate claims and eligibility check workflows.


# Transaction Enrollment
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/healthcare/transaction-enrollment



All payers require providers to complete an enrollment process before they can start receiving claim remittances (ERAs). Some payers also require enrollment before allowing providers to submit transactions like claims and eligibility checks.

Transaction enrollment involves submitting information about the provider that will send or receive transactions, including the provider's name, tax ID, [NPI](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier), billing address, and contact information.

You can find out if a payer requires enrollment for a particular transaction type in the [Stedi Payer Network](https://www.stedi.com/healthcare/network).

## Requirements

Transaction enrollment often requires completed credentialing and payer enrollment. Visit [Enrollment types](/healthcare/enrollment-types) to learn more about these processes.

If a payer rejects your transaction enrollment request with a message indicating the provider is "not on file" or "not recognized," it likely means the provider hasn't completed credentialing and payer enrollment with that payer.

## Enrollment process

You submit a transaction enrollment request to the Stedi customer success team, and we'll handle the entire enrollment process for you, including submitting the required information to the payer and monitoring the status of the enrollment.

All [enrollment submission methods](#enrollment-methods) go through the same high-level stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a new provider record.">
    The provider record includes the information required to enroll the provider with payers, including the provider's name, tax ID, [NPI](/healthcare/national-provider-identifier), and contact information.

    When submitting enrollment requests through the UI or API, you must either first create a new provider record or reference an existing one. When you submit requests through bulk CSV import, Stedi creates provider records automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit a transaction enrollment request.">
    You submit enrollment requests to enroll the provider with required payers. An enrollment request includes the provider record, the transaction type you want to enroll, the payer you want to enroll with, and a designated contact that the payer can communicate with about the enrollment. You must create one enrollment request for each transaction type. For example, you would create three separate requests to enroll a provider for 837P (professional) claims, 270 real-time eligibility checks, and 835 ERAs (claim payments).

    With the [Enrollments API](/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-enrollment), you can create enrollment requests in `DRAFT` status first and change the status to `SUBMITTED` later when you're ready to submit them to Stedi. When creating enrollments [through the UI](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments/create) or through [bulk CSV import](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments/bulk), requests are automatically submitted upon creation. Stedi only gets alerted about new enrollment requests once they're in `SUBMITTED` status.

    After you submit the enrollment request, you can no longer update it without contacting support.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stedi submits the enrollment to the payer.">
    Stedi begins the enrollment process with the payer and sets the enrollment status to `PROVISIONING`.

    Our network and enrollment operations team knows the nuances of each payer’s enrollment requirements and maintains a public repository of payers that require additional steps through our [Transaction Enrollments Hub](https://enrollments.stedi.com/?v=1a7685bc14df80ed8e07000c941f6bff). If payers have additional requirements as part of their standard enrollment process, Stedi contacts you with clear, actionable steps to move the process forward. In addition to updating your enrollment request with action items required for your team, we'll also reach out to you in your dedicated Slack channel with resources and to answer any follow-up questions.

    You can cancel an enrollment at any time by contacting Stedi support in Slack. Once an enrollment is canceled, Stedi sets its status to `CANCELED` and stops the enrollment process with the payer.

    In rare cases, the enrollment status might be set to `REJECTED` if the payer denies the enrollment request. Rejection can happen for many reasons, but the most common are that the provider isn't credentialed with the payer and that there was incorrect data in the enrollment submission. If this happens, Stedi will contact you in Slack to help resolve the issue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enrollment is complete.">
    Once the enrollment is approved, the enrollment status is set to `LIVE`, and the provider can start exchanging the enrolled transactions with the payer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create enrollment requests

You can submit enrollment requests in three different ways, depending on your preference. All requests go through the same high-level [enrollment process](#enrollment-process) once submitted.

### Individual UI submission

Creating individual enrollment requests through the Stedi portal involves two steps:

1. **Create a provider record:** Visit the [Providers](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/providers) page and click **New provider**.
2. **Create an enrollment request:** Visit the [Enrollments](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments) page and click **New enrollment**.

### Bulk CSV import

To create enrollment requests, go to the [Bulk imports page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments/bulk) and click **New bulk import**.

The upload page contains detailed instructions for formatting the CSV file. Once you upload the file, Stedi checks for errors and flags any rows that require adjustments. You can either fix the errors and re-upload the CSV file or click **Continue anyway** to proceed with importing valid rows.

Stedi automatically does the following when importing enrollment requests from a CSV file:

* Creates provider records as needed. Stedi creates a new provider record for each unique combination of NPI and tax ID in the CSV file. For example, these two providers would be created as separate records even though they have the same name and NPI:
  * `John Doe, NPI: 1999999984, Tax ID: 987654321`
  * `John Doe, NPI: 1999999984, Tax ID: 123456789`
    <Warning>
      When a row in your CSV file contains an NPI and tax ID that match an
      existing provider record, Stedi overwrites the existing provider record
      with the information in the CSV file. Any changes (such as updated address
      or contact information) aren't automatically applied to existing
      enrollment requests for that provider, only to requests created after
      Stedi updated the record.
    </Warning>
* Creates enrollment requests. You can track each request through the [Enrollments page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments) once the import is complete.
* Removes duplicate rows to prevent duplicate requests.
* Checks for errors. Stedi imports valid rows and skips any that contain errors. For example, if a row contains an invalid NPI, Stedi skips that row and imports the rest of the file.

After importing, you can download a report that shows the status of each row in the CSV file. For example, duplicate rows are marked as `Duplicate: Enrollment already exists` in the `result` column.

Rows with errors display a clear inline error message to help you quickly make the necessary adjustments. You can fix rows with errors and re-upload The CSV file as many times as needed until all imports are successful.

### API

Creating enrollment requests programmatically through Stedi's APIs involves two steps:

1. **Create a provider record:** Call the [Create Provider](/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-provider) endpoint.
2. **Create an enrollment request:** Call the [Create Enrollment](/api-reference/healthcare/post-enrollment-create-enrollment) endpoint. You can create enrollment requests in `DRAFT` status first and change the status to `SUBMITTED` later when you're ready to submit them to Stedi.

## Review enrollment status

You can review the details and status of every enrollment request on the [Enrollments page](https://portal.stedi.com/app/healthcare/enrollments) in Stedi. Alternatively, you can use the [List Enrollments](/api-reference/healthcare/get-enrollment-list-enrollments) endpoint.

## Enrollments hub

Our network and enrollment operations team knows the nuances of each payer’s enrollment requirements and maintains a public repository of payers that require additional steps through our [Transaction Enrollments Hub](https://enrollments.stedi.com/?v=1a7685bc14df80ed8e07000c941f6bff).

## FAQ

**I'm already enrolled through another clearinghouse. Do I need to enroll through Stedi as well?**

Yes. Enrollment is specific to each clearinghouse. So if a payer requires enrollment, you will need to go through the enrollment process with Stedi to begin exchanging transactions through the Stedi clearinghouse.

**Once I enroll through Stedi, what will happen to the ERAs I currently receive through a different clearinghouse?**

ERAs can only be sent to a single clearinghouse. Once you enroll for ERAs through Stedi, all ERAs from that payer to the provider you enrolled will come through Stedi. The provider will no longer receive ERAs from that payer through your previous clearinghouse.

PLEASE READ THESE SERVICE TERMS (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY STEDI, INC. (“STEDI”). BY INDICATING ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS THROUGH STEDI'S ONLINE ENROLLMENT PROCESS OR MUTUALLY EXECUTING OR OTHERWISE AGREEING VIA AN ONLINE SIGN UP PROCESS TO ONE OR MORE ORDER FORMS WITH STEDI WHICH REFERENCE THESE TERMS (EACH, AN “ORDER FORM”), YOU (“CUSTOMER”) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS (TOGETHER WITH ALL ORDER FORMS AND THE BUSINESS ASSOCIATE ADDENDUM (THE “BAA”) BETWEEN THE PARTIES (IF ANY), THIS “AGREEMENT”) TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS. IN ADDITION, ANY ONLINE ORDER FORM WHICH YOU SUBMIT VIA STEDI'S STANDARD ONLINE PROCESS AND WHICH IS ACCEPTED BY STEDI SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MUTUALLY EXECUTED. IF YOU ARE USING STEDI'S SERVICES ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY, ORGANIZATION, OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, THEN YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF SUCH ENTITY AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO SUCH TERMS.

## 1. Order Forms; Access to the Service

Upon mutual execution, each Order Form shall be incorporated into and form a part of the Agreement.  For each Order Form, subject to Customer’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including any limitations and restrictions set forth on the applicable Order Form) Stedi grants Customer a nonexclusive, limited, personal, nonsublicensable, nontransferable right and license to internally access and use the Stedi product(s) and/or service(s) specified in such Order Form (collectively, the “Service,” or “Services”) during the applicable Order Form Term (as defined below) for the internal business purposes of Customer and in connection with Customer’s products and services (but, for clarity, not as a stand-alone product or service of Customer or its affiliates that does not provide substantial additional value independent from the Service itself), in each case, only as provided herein and only in accordance with Stedi’s applicable official user documentation for such Service (the “Documentation”).

## 2. Implementation

Upon payment of any applicable fees set forth in each Order Form, Stedi agrees to use reasonable commercial efforts to provide standard implementation assistance for the Service only if and to the extent such assistance is set forth on such Order Form (“Implementation Assistance”).  If Customer requests implementation assistance or other professional services in excess of any agreed-upon hours estimate, or if Stedi otherwise provides additional requested services beyond those agreed in an Order Form, Customer will pay Stedi at its then-current hourly rates for consultation.

## 3. Support; Service Levels

Subject to Customer’s payment of all applicable fees, Stedi will provide support, maintenance, and uptime for each Service in accordance with (i) the support package selected by Customer on the applicable Order Form (if any) and (ii) Stedi’s then-current standard Service Level Agreement (the current version of which is available at [https://www.stedi.com/docs/legal/slas/healthcare](https://www.stedi.com/docs/legal/slas/healthcare).

## 4. Service Updates

From time to time, Stedi may provide upgrades, patches, enhancements, or fixes for the Services at its discretion, some at no additional charge and others subject to additional fees (“New Product Offerings”). Stedi is under no obligation to provide any such updates or New Product Offerings. Stedi may make these available to Customer’s account without requiring additional signatures. If a New Product Offering will incur additional charges, Stedi will notify Customer in advance, with pricing included in the notification, and any applicable supplementary terms at Stedi.com/docs/legal/service-terms. By using a New Product Offering, Customer acknowledges and agrees to the applicable pricing and terms. Customer may opt out of future use of any New Product Offering by providing written notice to Stedi and will only be billed for New Product Offering services actually used prior to the opt-out request. Stedi may make other improvements and modifications to the Services at any time in its sole discretion, provided that Stedi shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give Customer reasonable prior notice of any major changes.

## 5. Ownership; Feedback

As between the parties, Stedi retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, and all software, products, works, and other intellectual property and moral rights related thereto or created, used, or provided by Stedi for the purposes of this Agreement, including any copies and derivative works of the foregoing.  Any software which is distributed or otherwise provided to Customer hereunder (including without limitation any software identified on an Order Form) shall be deemed a part of the “Services” and subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly and unambiguously set forth in this Agreement.  Customer may (but is not obligated to) provide suggestions, comments or other feedback to Stedi with respect to the Service (“Feedback”). Stedi acknowledges and agrees that all Feedback is provided “AS IS” and without warranty of any kind.  Notwithstanding anything else, Customer shall, and hereby does, grant to Stedi a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid up license to use and exploit the Feedback for any purpose.  Nothing in this Agreement will impair Stedi’s right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote or distribute products, software or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with any products, software or technologies that Customer may develop, produce, market, or distribute.

## 6. Confidentiality

“Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by or on behalf of a party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”) in connection with this Agreement that is conspicuously marked, or orally, and if applicable, visually stated as confidential or would normally be considered confidential information by a reasonable party under the circumstances. “Confidential Information” does not include information that Receiving Party can document: (1) is independently developed by Receiving Party; (2) is rightfully given to Receiving Party by a third party without confidentiality obligations; or (3) becomes public through no fault of Receiving Party. Stedi’s Confidential Information includes non-public information regarding features, functionality, performance, and pricing of the Services, the Documentation, API(s), and other Stedi products or services. Each party as Receiving Party will take reasonable precautions to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information and will not use (except as expressly permitted in this Agreement) or divulge to any third party any Confidential Information. Customer authorizes Stedi to release Confidential Information to third parties as required to provide the Services. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Receiving Party may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information, in whole or in part (i) to its employees, officers, directors, consultants and professional advisers (e.g., attorneys, auditors, financial advisors, accountants and other professional representatives) who have a need to know and are legally bound to keep such Confidential Information confidential by confidentiality obligations, or, in the case of professional advisors, are bound by ethical duties, to keep such Confidential Information confidential consistent with the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) as required by law, in which case, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Receiving Party will (A) provide Discloser with prior written notification thereof, (B) provide Receiving Party with the opportunity to contest such disclosure, and (C) use its reasonable efforts to minimize such disclosure. Receiving Party is responsible and liable for its employees’ and representatives’ compliance with this Section 6, as if their actions or inactions were an action or inaction of Receiving Party.

## 7. Fees; Payment

Customer shall pay Stedi fees as set forth in each Order Form (“Fees”).  Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form, all Fees shall be invoiced monthly, in arrears and all invoices issued under this Agreement are payable in U.S. dollars upon receipt unless otherwise stated in the Order Form. Past due invoices are subject to interest on any outstanding balance of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law.  Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Service (excluding taxes based on Stedi’s net income).  All Fees paid are non-refundable and are not subject to set-off. If Stedi permits Customer to pay fees by purchasing cards, credit cards, or debit cards, Stedi reserves the right to charge a 3% convenience fee.

## 8. Use of Services

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Customer shall not (and shall not permit any third party to), directly or indirectly: (i) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of the Service (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction); (ii) modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Service; (iii) copy, rent, lease, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to the Service; (iv) use the Service for the benefit of a third party; (v) remove or otherwise alter any proprietary notices or labels from the Service or any portion thereof; (vi) use the Service to build an application or product that is competitive with any Stedi product or service; (vii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or any activities conducted on the Service; (viii) bypass any measures Stedi may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service (or other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Service); (ix) make any representations or warranties to any third party with respect to the Services that are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; (x) submit transactions in a manner that Stedi, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems excessive or abusive; (xi) submit eligibility and benefits transactions or otherwise use or access the Services in an attempt to determine the existence, status, or details of an individual's insurance coverage without a reasonable basis for believing such coverage exists unless explicitly authorized to do so by Stedi; (xii) use the Services for any high risk activities in which the failure of the Services could lead to severe physical, economic, or environmental damage; (xiii) use bots, scraping methods, or other unauthorized techniques to access or retrieve information from the Services; (xiv) use the Service in a manner that violates any third party intellectual property, contractual or other proprietary rights or any requirements of payers or intermediary service providers; or (xv) submit data subject to any export control law or the European Union Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). Customer is responsible for all of Customer’s activity in connection with the Service, including but not limited to uploading Customer Data (as defined below) onto the Service.  Customer shall (a) use the Service in compliance with all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws, treaties, and regulations in connection with Customer’s use of the Service (including those related to data privacy, international communications, export laws and the transmission of technical or personal data laws); (b) adhere to rules, regulations and policies of payers and intermediary service providers and obtain any documents or supplementary agreements requested by Stedi necessary to comply therewith; (c) immediately delete any data or information erroneously routed, provided, delivered, or made available to Customer upon notice from Stedi, which notice may be via email or telephone and is expressly excepted from the notice requirements in Section 16; (d) maintain and enforce security measures at least as protective as industry best practices to reduce the risk of security breaches and unauthorized access to the Services; and (e) notify Stedi promptly of any known or suspected security breach or unauthorized use of the Services. Stedi may suspend Customer’s access to and use of any Service and Stedi’s platform without credit at any time if Stedi believes that Customer’s access to the Services puts the performance, integrity, or security of the Services in danger of being compromised or presents a security risk. Stedi shall not be responsible for any damages, whether direct or indirect, resulting from Customer’s decision not to use any security features or products offered by Stedi and for Customer’s use or misuse of the Services in violation of the security measures recommended by Stedi. With respect to Medicaid eligibility transactions, Customer agrees, and will require those who submit transactions to Customer to agree, that: (i) access to eligibility information will be restricted to the sole purpose of verifying Medicaid eligibility where the recipient has requested Medicaid payment for medical services, (ii) verification of eligibility under the system is not a guarantee of payment, and the records as to the recipient’s eligibility status will be the final authority; and (iii) Customer will abide by the Federal and State regulations regarding confidentiality of information.

## 9. Customer Data

For purposes of this Agreement, “Customer Data” shall mean any data, information or other material provided, uploaded, or submitted by Customer to the Service in the course of using the Service.  Customer shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Data, including all intellectual property rights therein.  Customer, not Stedi, shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all Customer Data. Customer represents and warrants that it has all necessary rights, consents, and authorizations and will provide all necessary notices and disclosures to provide the Customer Data to Stedi and for Stedi to use Customer Data in the performance of its obligations, including any access by or transmission to third parties as contemplated hereunder, in each case without any infringement, violation or misappropriation of any third party rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and rights of privacy). Stedi shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the Service and the Customer Data.  Stedi is not responsible to Customer for unauthorized access to Customer Data or the unauthorized use of the Service unless such access is due to Stedi’s willful misconduct.  Customer is responsible for all activities that occur under its account and the use of the Service by any person to whom Customer has given access to the Service, even if Customer did not authorize such use, and Stedi is entitled to rely upon the data input occurring under any Customer account. Customer shall enter into a BAA with Stedi prior to using the Service to store or process Protected Health Information (“PHI”) and may only transmit PHI in accordance with the BAA. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that any PHI it transmits is sent only through Stedi-approved communication methods. Stedi is not responsible for any unauthorized disclosure of PHI resulting from Customer’s use of unapproved channels. To the extent that the Customer Data includes any personal information, (i) Stedi will process, retain, use, and disclose such personal information only as necessary to provide the Services hereunder and as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, which constitutes a business purpose, (ii) Stedi agrees not to sell such personal data, to retain, use, or disclose such personal data for any commercial purpose other than the foregoing purposes, or to retain, use, or disclose such personal data outside of the scope of this Agreement. Stedi understands its obligations under applicable data protection laws and will comply with them. Customer agrees and acknowledges that Customer Data may be irretrievably deleted if Customer’s account is 90 days or more delinquent.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Stedi may (i) internally use and modify (but not disclose) Customer Data for the purposes of (A) providing the Service to Customer and (B) generating Aggregated De-Identified Data (as defined below), and (ii) freely use, monetize, retain and make available Aggregated De-Identified Data for Stedi’s business purposes (including without limitation, for purposes of improving, testing, operating, promoting and marketing Stedi’s products and services). “Aggregated De-Identified Data” means data submitted to, collected by, or generated by Stedi in connection with Customer’s use of the Service, but only in aggregate, de-identified form which, when used outside of Stedi, can in no way be linked specifically to Customer and if the underlying data constituted PHI, such data has been de-identified in accordance with the standard and implementation specifications set forth at 45 CFR 164.514(a) and (b).

## 10. Third Party Integrations

Customer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Service may operate on, with or using application programming interfaces (APIs) and/or other services operated or provided by third parties (e.g., other vendors of Customer) (“Third Party Integrations”), (ii) the availability and operation of the Service or certain portions thereof may be dependent on Stedi’s ability to access such Third Party Integrations, and (iii) Customer’s failure to provide adequate access or any retraction of permissions relating to such Third Party Integrations may result in a suspension or interruption of the Service. Customer hereby represents and warrants that it has all rights, licenses, permissions and consents necessary to connect, use and access any Third Party Integrations that it integrates with the Service, and Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Stedi for all claims, damages and liabilities arising out of Customer’s use of any Third Party Integrations in connection with or through the Service.  Stedi cannot and does not guarantee that the Service shall incorporate (or continue to incorporate) any particular Third Party Integrations and does not make any representations or warranties with respect to Third Party Integrations. Customer is solely responsible for procuring any and all rights necessary for it to access Third Party Integrations (including any Customer Data or other information relating thereto) and for complying with any applicable terms or conditions thereof.  Any exchange of data or other interaction between Customer and a third party provider is solely between Customer and such third party provider and is governed by such third party’s terms and conditions.

## 11. Term; Termination

This Agreement shall commence upon the date of the first Order Form, and, unless earlier terminated in accordance herewith, shall last until the expiration of all Order Form Terms.  For each Order Form, unless otherwise specified therein, the “Order Form Term” shall begin as of the effective date set forth on such Order Form, and unless earlier terminated as set forth herein, (x) shall continue for the initial term specified on such Order Form (the “Order Form Initial Term”), and (y) following the Order Form Initial Term, shall automatically renew for additional successive periods of equal duration to the Order Form Initial Term (each, a “Order Form Renewal Term”) unless either party notifies the other party of such party’s intention not to renew no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the Order Form Initial Term or then-current Order Form Renewal Term, as applicable. In the event of a material breach of this Agreement by either party, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the breaching party, provided that the breaching party does not materially cure such breach within 30 days of receipt of such notice.  Without limiting the foregoing, Stedi may suspend or limit Customer’s access to or use of the Service if (i) Customer’s account is more than 60 days past due, or (ii) Customer’s use of the Service results in (or is reasonably likely to result in) damage to or material degradation of the Service which interferes with Stedi’s ability to provide access to the Service to other customers; provided that in the case of subsection (ii): (a) Stedi shall use reasonable good faith efforts to work with Customer to resolve or mitigate the damage or degradation in order to resolve the issue without resorting to suspension or limitation; (b) prior to any such suspension or limitation, Stedi shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to Customer describing the nature of the damage or degradation; and (c) Stedi shall reinstate Customer’s use of or access to the Service, as applicable, if Customer remediates the issue within 30 days of receipt of such notice.  All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, accrued payment obligations, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. For clarity, any services provided by Stedi to Customer, including any assistance in exporting the Customer Data, shall be billable at Stedi’s standard rates then in effect.

## 12. Indemnification

Stedi shall defend indemnify, and hold harmless Customer its affiliates and each of its and its affiliates’ employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, suits, actions, or proceedings brought by an unaffiliated third party alleging that the Service infringes, violates, or misappropriates any valid third party intellectual property right; provided that (a) Customer promptly notifies Stedi of the threat or notice of such claim; (b) Stedi will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, and defend or settle any such claim; and (c) Customer fully cooperates with Stedi in connection therewith. The foregoing obligations of Stedi do not apply with respect to the Service or any information, technology, materials or data (or any portions or components of the foregoing) to the extent (i) not created or provided by Stedi (including without limitation any Customer Data), (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance to Customer specifications, (iii) modified after delivery by Stedi, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials not provided by Stedi (where the alleged losses arise from or relate to such combination), (v) where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) Customer’s use of the Service is not strictly in accordance herewith. If use of a Service by Customer has become, or, in Stedi’s opinion, is likely to become, the subject of any such claim, Stedi may, at its option and expense, (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (ii) replace or modify a Service to make it non-infringing; or (iii) if options (i) or (ii) are not commercially reasonable or practicable as determined by Stedi, terminate the Agreement and repay, on a pro-rata basis, any fees previously paid to Stedi for the corresponding unused portion of the term for related Services. This Section states Stedi’s entire liability, and Customer's exclusive remedy, for any claims for infringement or unlawful misappropriation, regardless of the type of claim of such action, claim or proceeding. Customer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Stedi, its affiliates and each of its and its affiliates’ employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, investigations, fines, settlements, damages of any kind, and expenses paid or payable (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise from or in any way relate to (i) the Customer Data or Customer’s use of the Service, including Customer’s failure to obtain any required consents, or failure to notify Stedi of any change in, or revocation of, permission by an individual regarding the use of personal data, or (ii) Customer’s violation of this Agreement.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE, FREE TRIAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY AND STEDI SHALL HAVE NO INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS NOR LIABILITY OF ANY TYPE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL SERVICES UNLESS SUCH EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW IN WHICH CASE STEDI’S LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE TRIAL SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED \$1,000.00. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE “LIMITATION OF LIABILITY” SECTION ABOVE, CUSTOMER SHALL BE FULLY LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO STEDI AND ITS AFFILIATES FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE TRIAL SERVICES, ANY BREACH BY CUSTOMER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF CUSTOMER’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER

# Service Level Agreement
Source: https://stedi.com/docs/legal/slas/stedi-sla



This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) is a policy governing the use of the Services as defined in the Service Terms or other agreement with us governing your use of our Services (the “Agreement”) and applies separately to each account using the Services. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this SLA and the terms of the Agreement, the terms and conditions of this SLA apply, but only to the extent of such conflict. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.

## Service Commitment

Stedi will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage, during any monthly billing cycle, of at least 99.9% (the “Service Commitment”). In the event the Services do not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.

## ​Service Credits

Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total fees paid by you for Healthcare APIs for the monthly billing cycle in which the Monthly Uptime Percentage fell within the ranges set forth in the table below:

| Monthly Uptime Percentage                          | Service Credit Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Less than 99.9% but greater than or equal to 95.0% | 10%                       |
| Less than 95.0% but greater than or equal to 90.0% | 25%                       |
| Less than 90.0%                                    | 100%                      |

Costs payable by Stedi to third parties in connection with the Services are not covered by the SLA. We will apply any Service Credits only against future payments otherwise due from you. At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credits to the credit card you used to pay for the billing cycle in which the unavailability occurred. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from Stedi. Service Credits will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar (\$1 USD). Service Credits may not be transferred or applied to any other account. Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability or non-performance or other failure by us to provide Services is the receipt of Service Credits (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.

## Credit Request and Payment Procedures

To receive Service Credits, you will need to submit a claim by opening a case. To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include:

* (i) the words “SLA Credit Request” in the subject line;
* (ii) the billing cycle with respect to which you are claiming Service Credits, together with the Monthly Uptime Percentage for the billing cycle and the specific dates, times, and Availabilities for each 5-minute interval with less than 100% Availability throughout the billing cycle;
* (iii) your Request logs that document the errors for your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).

If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such credit request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment, then we will issue the Service Credits to you within one billing cycle following the month in which the credit request occurred. Your failure to provide the credit request and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving Service Credits.

## SLA Exclusions

The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination of Services, or any other performance issues: (i) caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including the availability of external clearinghouses or payers, or any force majeure event; (ii) that result from any voluntary actions or inactions from you or any third party; (iii) that result from you not following any best practices described in the documentation on the Stedi site; (iv) that result from your equipment, software or other technology; or (v) arising from our suspension or termination of your right to use Services in accordance with the Agreement (collectively, the “ SLA Exclusions”). If availability is impacted by factors other than those explicitly used in our Monthly Uptime Percentage calculation, then we may issue a Service Credit considering such factors at our discretion.

## Definitions

### Availability

“Availability” is calculated for each 5-minute interval as the percentage of Requests processed by APIs that do not fail with Errors. If you did not make any Requests in a given 5-minute interval, that interval is assumed to be 100% available.

### Request

“Request” is a request to any Healthcare API or an attempt to process a file in a non-Healthcare API application  ( “EDI Platform”).

### Error

An “Error” is any Request that returns a 500 or 503 error code in the case of Healthcare APIs or marked as an internal server error in the case of the EDI Platform.

### Monthly Uptime Percentage

“Monthly Uptime Percentage” is calculated as the average of the Availability for all 5-minute intervals in a monthly billing cycle. Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude downtime resulting directly or indirectly from any SLA Exclusion.

### Service Credit

A “Service Credit” is a dollar credit, calculated as set forth above, that we may credit back to an eligible account for payment.

## Examples

### Healthcare API

* There are 8,640 5-minute intervals in a 30 day month.
* During 864 of the 8,640 5-minute intervals, you send 1,000 requests to the Healthcare APIs API - 100 of which fail.
* Each of these 864 5-minute intervals are considered to be 90% available (100/1,000 = 90%)
* For the rest of the month, you do not experience any issues with the service (and each interval of non-usage is considered to be 100% available)
* Assuming all the other 7,776 5-minute intervals are 100% available, the uptime for the month is 99% ((864 \_ .9)+(7,776 \_ 1))/ 8,640 = .99

In this case, the Healthcare APIs API is in breach of the Monthly Uptime Percentage of 99.9%, and therefore you will be credited 10% of your Healthcare APIs’s spend for that month’s billing cycle, which will be applied to a future month’s bill.

### EDI Platform

* There are 8,640 5-minute intervals in a 30 day month.
* During 864 of the 8,640 5-minute intervals, you trigger 100 file executions – 90 of which succeed and 10 of which fail – to Core.
* Each of these 864 5-minute intervals are considered to be 90% available (10/100 = 90%)
* For the rest of the month, you do not experience any issues with the service (and each interval of non-usage is considered to be 100% available)
* Assuming all the other 7,776 5-minute intervals are 100% available, the uptime for the month is 99%: ((864 usage minutes \_ 0.90 average availability) + (7,776 non-usage minutes \_ 100% availability)) / 8,640 = 0.99 monthly availability.

In this case, Core is in breach of the Monthly Uptime Percentage of 99.9%, and therefore you will be credited 10% of your Core spend for that month’s billing cycle, which will be applied to a future month’s bill.
