# Using VPS Control Panel

This is an overview of our virtual server control panel.

## Overview

We offer virtual server management functions through our own, heavily modified control panel.

## Launching Convoy

To launch Convoy, navigate to your VPS product page on [https://clients.advinservers.com](https://clients.advinservers.com) and click on the big button that says Launch VPS Management Panel (SSO).
![VPS Launch](https://advin-cdn.b-cdn.net/Knowledgebase/chrome_H9geoJRzggdnEU1JDukZzmT2Z88nji.png)

## Server Reinstallation

You can easily reinstall your server by going to the Reinstall tab.

You can choose from a variety of operating system distributions available.
![Windows Server](https://advin-cdn.b-cdn.net/Knowledgebase/chrome_FdzuWDdWU7nog50UyfwdJeaRWp0P55.png)

## ISO Mounting

Please open a ticket if you wish to use a custom ISO. Once added, you can mount an ISO image by navigating to Settings -> Hardware and selecting an ISO to mount. In this tab, you can also change the boot order to prioritize your ISO. Once done with the ISO, please remove the ISO in the Settings -> Hardware tab and then notify support.

## Password

In order to change your password, please navigate to Settings -> Security. You can change your password or add an SSH key here. Adding an SSH key may require a server restart, but resetting the password does not. SSH keys are not supported with Windows servers.

## Power Actions

You can force stop or start the server at any time. The force stop command is not recommended as it will result in an instant shutdown, potentially causing data integrity issues for your virtual server. Running the shutdown command within the VM is your best option.

## Backups

Backups are currently experimental. Restoring a backup will cause full loss of your existing data. Backups are made on a best-effort basis, meaning that we cannot guarantee the longevity or reliability of them. Typically, we take backups once a day and keep up to 5 days worth of backups. This is not a replacement for taking your own, individual backups. Backups can take multiple hours to restore since they are pulled from cold storage. It is recommended to take a backup of your VPS prior to restoration.

## Remote Console

You can choose to use our noVNC console, but this should only be used in emergency situations. You should ideally connect directly with SSH or RDP.

## Firewall

You can establish firewall rules to block or accept traffic. To disable the firewall, you may delete all of the rules.


# Installing Windows on VPS

This is an overview on installing Windows.

## Overview

We do not provide licensing and we can only provide very surface-level support for any Windows-based operating systems. By default, it is possible to activate a 180-day evaluation edition for the purposes of evaluating Windows Server. Once the 180-day evaluation is expired, your server will **automatically restart every 1 hour**.

If you have a dedicated server or a product that is not a virtual server, please open a ticket for assistance as this guide may not help you, since dedicated servers are based on a completely different infrastructure.

## Installing Windows Server

First, please launch the VPS management panel by navigating to the product page and clicking the green button that says Launch VPS Management Panel (SSO) or similar.
![VPS Launch](https://advin-cdn.b-cdn.net/Knowledgebase/chrome_H9geoJRzggdnEU1JDukZzmT2Z88nji.png)

Once done, you can click on the "Reinstall" tab and install Windows Server. We support Windows Server 2012R2, Server 2019, and Server 2022.

## Final Steps

Please wait 3-5 minutes for the reinstallation to complete, and then another 3-5 minutes for the VPS to finally boot up. Windows has now completed the installation.

# Hardware Information

This is an overview of the hardware that we use on our hypervisors.

## Overview

We use various types of hardware across all of our hypervisors. The specific processor that you get will depend on what is specifically available or in stock. Some locations have varying hardware than others. Please note that we cannot guarantee which processor you will get in these plans. The processor your plan is hosted on may change in the future, especially as brand new more performant and/or power efficient hardware comes out.

## Lineups

### Virtual Servers

#### KVM Premium VPS

Across all of our KVM Premium VPS plans, we usually use DDR5 ECC memory. The memory speeds run up to 4800 MHz for this specific lineup, and we are always running Gen4 RAID10 Enterprise NVMe SSD. This lineup uses the latest generation of AMD EPYC processors, making for one of our best stability and performing VPS plans.

**Available Processors**

*   AMD EPYC Genoa 9554
*   AMD EPYC Genoa 9654

#### KVM Standard VPS

Across all of our KVM Standard VPS plans, we usually use DDR4 (ECC). Generally, we either run RAID1 or RAID10 NVMe SSD's. The memory speeds can vary from 2400 MHz to 2933 MHz, though most of our modern AMD EPYC VPS hypervisors use 2666 MHz DDR4 memory. **Please note that we may not be able to move your VM or guarantee a specific CPU in this list**, these are just processors that you may potentially get in the CPU pool.

**Available Processors**

*   AMD EPYC Milan 7763
*   AMD EPYC Milan 7B13
*   AMD EPYC Milan 7J13
*   AMD EPYC Rome 7502 (Japan Only)

**Available Processors**

*   AMD Ryzen 7950X
*   AMD Ryzen 7950X3D

#### KVM 9950X VDS

Across all of our KVM 7950X VDS plans, we usually either run RAID1 Gen4 NVMe SSD's. The memory speed is always 3600 MHz, as we run 4 DIMM DDR5 configurations.

**Available Processors**

*   AMD Ryzen 9950X

### Other

#### Website Hosting

**Available Processors**

*   AMD Ryzen 7900
*   AMD EPYC Genoa 9654
*   Intel Xeon Silver 4215R

## Clock Speeds

All of our virtual private servers run at their respective turbo boost clock speeds. We do not throttle the processors or limit the TDP's of the processors that we use. Please keep in mind that the CPU clock speed shown in your virtual machine is most likely inaccurate, as the real CPU turbo speeds are not reflected and virtual machines use the base clock as a placeholder. Most of the processors we use can boost well past 3 GHz+. In addition, we always ensure that there is adequate cooling for the processors that we use.


# Network Information

This is an overview of our network.

## DDoS Mitigation

At our locations in Los Angeles, Miami, Nuremberg, Secaucus, and Johor, we offer basic Layer 4 (L4) DDoS mitigation to help protect your services against common and low-volume attacks. This mitigation is designed to handle typical network-level threats; however, services frequently targeted by sophisticated or high-volume DDoS attacks may experience service suspension to maintain overall network stability. For advanced and robust protection, we strongly recommend using an external solution like Cloudflare or similar providers specializing in DDoS mitigation.

Please note:

*   Firewall Limitations: User-configurable firewall filters are not available, and custom rules cannot be applied on your behalf.
*   No Capacity Guarantees: We do not advertise specific mitigation capacity or provide SLAs for DDoS mitigation. Our focus is on maintaining a stable and reliable network, and mitigation capabilities may vary depending on the attack vector and volume.
*   Network Adaptability: Our network infrastructure is continually evolving to better meet customer needs, so this information is subject to change. We do not put a heavy emphasis on DDoS mitigation across our products as it is not our speciality.

For virtual servers in locations not listed above, a nullroute will be applied in the event of a large-scale attack, as these locations lack built-in DDoS mitigation. This approach ensures the broader network remains unaffected.

## Port Capacities

All of our virtual servers come with a 10 Gbps port by default.

## Internal Traffic

If you have two virtual private servers in the same location, all traffic between them will be free of charge, and they will be able to communicate with each other over a 10G or 40G shared link. Only some locations support this functionality at the time being. Please contact us if you would like to activate this functionality, it is not configured by default.

Internal traffic is currently supported in the following locations:

*   Los Angeles, CA
*   Nuremberg, DE
*   Miami, FL
*   Kansas City, MO

Internal traffic usage will show in the bandwidth graphs, but the traffic will be considered as free and will not be counted towards the fair use bandwidth policy.

## Looking Glass

We have a looking glass containing all of our locations below.

[https://lg.advinservers.com](https://lg.advinservers.com)

## BGP Sessions

We can allow a BGP session if you are paying a minimum of \$192/year with a service on yearly billing. We can allow monthly billing under certain circumstances depending on the location, please open a ticket for more information, but we usually require \$29/month minimum on monthly

We currently have experimental support for BGP sessions in the following locations:

# Fair Use Resources

This is an overview of our policies governing our fair use of resources.

Last Updated: `October 22nd, 2024`

## Overview

All plans, no matter the type (VPS, VDS, dedicated, etc), is subject to a fair use policy regarding the shared resources that are available. We try our best to make this as relaxed as possible, but there are resources that are shared with other users that you must keep in mind when using your product.

### CPU Usages

On dedicated servers or virtual dedicated servers, CPU usages are no problem and you are permitted to use your CPU at 100% 24x7 as the cores are dedicated to you. This section primarily applies to virtual private servers and website hosting plans, which have shared CPU resources.

We deem abuse to be usage that can cause a significant or noticeable impact on other machines, or usage that is excessive for your plan. Generally, we find that you should maintain under a 75% average CPU usage on virtual private servers in order to prevent any potential impact on other users. If we do find that your usage is excessive, we may deprioritize your CPU usage or potentially, in some rare circumstances, implement a 50% (or lower) temporary CPU usage limit. Most of our host nodes usually have plenty of CPU resources available, and hence it is rare that we have to implement caps or limitations, these are just general guidelines. It is fine to temporarily burst past 75% CPU usage, but sustained usage past that can be deemed as excessive and may be temporarily deprioritized and/or capped if a host node is running out of CPU compute resources.

As for website hosting, we usually cap the LVE limit to 1 core, in which we would recommend maintaining a guideline of a maximum of 25% of that 1 core. Most legitimate websites don't come anywhere close to this limit. If we deem your usage to be excessive, we may adjust the LVE limits to reduce the maximum CPU consumption of your website.

### Cryptocurrency or Blockchain Projects

Excessive or sustained use of shared resources like CPU or disk is not allowed on virtual private servers. Even if you limit the CPU usage, our infrastructure is simply not built to handle a lot of VMs that are all sustaining CPU.

If we do catch abnormal usage, your virtual private server may be suspended. Please contact us if you need a dedicated solution or have questions about running a specific cryptocurrency project, we can offer custom solutions that can cater to mining or we can let you know if it may result in a limit or suspension on our infrastructure.

Some cryptocurrency projects like Quilibrium or Monero may result in service suspension or termination. This is because they have a significant impact on the shared CPU resources past just the load on the cores, causing massive performance problems for our other virtual private servers.

No refunds will be issued if we have to suspend or limit your VPS due to a cryptocurrency project.

There are some cryptocurrency-related projects that do not max out the virtual server resources or cause significant load on the hardware (e.g. Flux). If there's no abnormalities, then yes, you're allowed to run it. However, projects like Quilibirum and Monero damage the hardware and cause problems for our other clients. If it is not Flux, then please contact us in advance of running it and we can give approval.

You are free to max out the CPU or run whichever cryptocurrency project you'd like on a dedicated server 24x7x365, there is no limitation there (as long as the disk wearout is not too high).

### Bandwidth Usage

On plans listed and/or advertised as having fair usage bandwidth, we expect you to keep your bandwidth levels reasonable. In a lot of our locations, we usually have spare bandwidth that we can allocate to our customers, hence why we can offer fair usage bandwidth in some of the locations where we have massive bandwidth allocations and/or commitments.

You are free to use your bandwidth as you wish, but it is typically not normal to sustain past 200 Mbps 24x7, and thus it is recommended to keep your usages under that. It is hard to determine a fine line, but ideally it would be great if you could keep your usages under 50-60TB on fair use plans. If we do see that your usages are high, especially if your plan costs a low amount, we may reach out to your or limit your network traffic. In general, this is incredibly rare and 99% of our clients will never reach this point on a fair use plan. Reverse proxies or VPN's are also held to higher scrutiny and are not recommended to be ran on "fair use" bandwidth plans if the bandwidth usages are expected to be high. Going against this policy may result in limitations in the bandwidth.

### I/O Usages

On virtual servers, we have no strict guidelines for I/O usages. Generally, most of our host nodes utilize Gen3 or Gen4 NVMe SSD's, so I/O usages are generally not a problem as it is exceptionally rare that our host nodes reach the maximum I/O available. We do expect you to keep your usages reasonable.

On both dedicated servers and virtual servers, we strictly forbid programs like Chia which cause unnecessary wear on the SSD's.

*   Failures on Individual VPS's
*   Performance Issues
*   Scheduled Maintenance Period
*   VPS Cancellation/Suspension

## Our Guarantee

We guarantee a 99% uptime SLA across all of our services. Here is a chart of the credits we will provide:

| Downtime Period      | Service Credit              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1 Hour of Downtime   | Service Extended by 1 Day   |
| 2 Hours of Downtime  | Service Extended by 2 Days  |
| 3 Hours of Downtime  | Service Extended by 3 Days  |
| 4 Hours of Downtime  | Service Extended by 4 Days  |
| 5 Hours of Downtime  | Service Extended by 5 Days  |

*   You must not have created a chargeback.
*   You must have created a ticket within 72 hours of the qualifying event.
*   Your service must not be cancelled/suspended.
*   SLA can only be claimed once per incident

**Note:** Multiple outages in a row can be considered part of the same incident, as long as the root cause is the same. For example, if your host node were to go offline due to an issue with an SSD (as an example), momentarily comes back online, and then goes back offline due to the same problem, that would be considered as one incident/event and can only have SLA claimable once. In order to identify whether your outage is related to the same incident/problem, please refer to our status page at [https://status.advinservers.com](https://status.advinservers.com). If the incidents are NOT considered separately with different incident ID's, then SLA would not be claimable twice. We reserve the right to deny SLA compensation depending on the circumstances.

Invoices for your services are typically generated 1 week, or more, in advance. If there is a failure to pay the invoice, we typically suspend your service after 3 days of the due date (once repeated emails are sent), and your service may be terminated after 1 week. We may keep your service for longer depending on the product.

If the product page states that the service is in the "Suspended" state, there is a high chance that the data is still there. If it shows that your service is in the "Terminated" state, then your data and/or service is most likely not available anymore.

It is your duty to submit a cancellation request through the control panel before the service due date. Failure to do so may result in the payment method on file being charged and/or the invoice not being properly cancelled.

Our refund policy is outlined in the Refund Policy.

### Multiple Accounts

Multiple accounts are allowed as long as it is not for the purposes of:

*   Utilizing a one-per-account promotion code again
*   Fradulent activity
*   Evading account closure or bans

If you are caught violating this policy, then we reserve the right to close the duplicate accounts without a refund.

The information on your accounts must be consistent across all of them (i.e. full name, address, phone number). If this is not the case, we will reach out and request that you update it.

### Geolocation

Please note that the geolocation of our subnets may not be correct as geolocation services are maintained by third party databases and organizations. If you are using our servers to access region-locked content, please contact us beforehand so that we can confirm.

### Storage

To provide you with our services, we will have to store your service's files on our servers.

Sometimes, backups of your servers may be stored depending on the product you purchased. We sometimes keep backups of your service in an off-site location depending on the product.

You may request to have your files deleted at any time.

### Fair Use

Please read our Fair Use policy for more information.

### Email Sending

We block port 25 by default and email sending across our infrastructure. We would recommend using a third party service like Amazon SES if you are planning to send mail. The only exception is on web hosting plans, where we use third party solutions to send out mail and carefully monitor to ensure that no spam is sent out.

If we believe that you are intentionally sending email spam, we reserve the right to charge a \$25 USD IP cleaning fee.

### Service Transfers

There is a \$5 USD transfer fee if you wish to transfer your service to another client account. This covers the administrative work of transferring services.

### Abuse

If we receive an abuse complaint, you are required to respond within 24 hours or your service will be suspended (or terminated after 7 days). If we see repeat abuse or intentional acts of abuse that may harm our infrastructure, we may take action immediately. We may charge a fee, such as a \$5 IP cleaning fee, if your service was caught email spamming or committing malicious acts intentionally. This covers the system administration work involved with delisting IP addresses from spam databases.

Any illegal activity, and activity that either may impact our infrastructure and/or taint the reputation of our services and/or IP ranges is strictly prohibited on our network and on our services.

Some types of activity we prohibit may include:

*   Port Scanning
*   Brute Forcing
*   Sending DDoS or DoS attacks
*   IP Spoofing
*   Phishing Attacks
*   Email Spamming
*   Copyrighted Content
*   Using "Cracked" Software

TOR exit nodes are allowed in certain locations; please contact us first before running one as we need to verify a couple of parameters and make sure that you are in the correct locations and/or on the correct IPv4 ranges.

Our fair use conditions for resources in our services are outlined in our Fair Use policy.

We base illegal activity on United States law, and the law that your server is based in. If your service is based in Germany, you are required to follow both German law and United States law on your service. It is your duty to perform due dilegence and make sure that what you are doing on your services is perfectly legal.

Copyrighted content is strictly forbidden on our services, and we will take action if we receive repeated copyright complaints. We do not ignore DMCA requests; most DMCA requests double as copyright infringement notifications.

### Termination

We reserve the right to terminate your service with or without a reason and with or without notice at any time.

### Data Loss

We are not responsible for any data loss across our services. Sometimes we take backups, but it is not a guarantee and it's the customer reponsibility to take their own backups.

### Tebex

We partner with Tebex Limited ([www.tebex.io](http://www.tebex.io)), who are the official merchant of digital content produced by us. If you wish to purchase licenses to use digital content we produce, you can do so through Tebex as our licensed reseller and merchant of record.

# Hardware Issues

Troubleshooting hardware issues.

## Overview

Hardware issues can sometimes (rarely) occur, where something is not working right and our monitoring systems may not have picked up on it. This could potentially be non-satisfactory CPU performance, disk performance, or other such issues with the server hardware itself. There are various ways you can diagnose this and provide information to our support team. As always, please open a ticket if you run into any problems.

## CPU Performance

If you are experiencing non-satisfactory CPU performance on a virtual server, there are a few things that you can check. You can try running the `top` command in your operating system and checking the value called `st`. This indicates CPU steal, which is the percentage of CPU that your VPS is waiting for from the hypervisor.

Generally, we try to keep our hypervisors at 0% CPU steal values. However, in some rarer cases where VPS hypervisors have higher CPU contention, you may see up to 5-10% CPU steal. This is not abnormal, especially in a shared environment where there are other virtual servers that have to compete for CPU resources. Even if there is some CPU left at the hypervisor level, some CPU steal could still present itself when the host node is past 50% CPU usage and starting to use hyperthreading (vCPU), or could present itself due to other parameters.

If you are seeing CPU steal values increase past 10%, it may be good to open a support ticket. You can also use monitors such as HetrixTools or Netdata to monitor the CPU steal values without having to constantly run `top`. Using these tools and providing our support with graphs can help us determine if the CPU steal is problematic and when it is specifically occuring.

If you are not seeing any CPU steal and CPU performance is unsatisfactory, please open a ticket and we will see what we can do or if there is anything we can diagnose. It is also important to note that Geekbench tests may show lower performance if your VPS is starting to use hyperthreaded vCPU cores.

Note: CPU steal values do not exist on bare metal hardware and/or dedicated servers. If you are experiencing unsatisfactory performance on a dedicated server, you could try running `lm-sensors` (install `lm-sensors` first) and checking the CPU temperatures.

## Disk Performance

Generally we use enterprise Gen3 or Gen4 NVMe SSD's across almost all of our VPS hypervisors, so disk performance issues are extraordinarily rare. We would recommend running `curl -sL yabs.sh | bash -s -- -i -g -n` and checking the fio results it outputs (Note: `yabs.sh` is a third-party tool, use at your own risk). As long as the 1m result is above 1 GB/s and 4k results are above 100 MB/s, it should be okay. Keep in mind that the disk speeds are usually shared, and sometimes Linux caches the disk into memory which causes fio results to be high for 4k/1m. Our virtual servers typically greatly exceed the 100 MB/s 4k and 1 GB/s 1m.

```
fio Disk Speed Tests (Mixed R/W 50/50):
---------------------------------
Block Size | 4k            (IOPS) | 64k           (IOPS)
  ------   | ---            ----  | ----           ----
Read       | 219.67 MB/s  (54.9k) | 1.64 GB/s    (25.7k)
Write      | 220.25 MB/s  (55.0k) | 1.65 GB/s    (25.8k)
Total      | 439.93 MB/s (109.9k) | 3.30 GB/s    (51.5k)
           |                      |
Block Size | 512k          (IOPS) | 1m            (IOPS)
  ------   | ---            ----  | ----           ----
Read       | 4.30 GB/s     (8.4k) | 4.91 GB/s     (4.7k)
Write      | 4.53 GB/s     (8.8k) | 5.24 GB/s     (5.1k)
Total      | 8.84 GB/s    (17.2k) | 10.15 GB/s    (9.9k)
```

If you are seeing low disk performance (i.e. under 1 GB/s on 1m or 100 MB/s on 4k), please open a ticket so that we can investigate.


# Network Problems

Troubleshooting network speeds.

## Overview

Networks are complex! It is best to open a ticket if you are running into any problems with our network, but following these instructions and providing our support with this information can greatly help with diagnosing potential network problems and potentially rerouting your connection or fixing network througput problems.

## Packet Loss

### Packet Loss from Home PC

If you suspect that you are experiencing packet loss from your home computer to your server, please follow these instructions. These instructions should be followed on your home PC.

### Windows

#### Installing MTR

WinMTR is a tool that will allow you to easily measure the latency to your server and see where packet loss is happening along with how often it is occurring. WinMTR is free and open source, it can be downloaded at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/).

Once done, please extract the zip file and launch the WinMTR.exe executable.

#### Using MTR

Once finished downloading and launching the executable, input your server IP address into the `Host:` field at the top of the window. Then click `Start`. Wait for a few minutes for the MTR, and once finished, click on `Copy Text to clipboard` and submit it in a support ticket. This will allow us to diagnose any network problems along your traceroute and see where packet loss could potentially be occurring.

### Linux or MacOS

#### Installing MTR

On Linux or MacOS, use your package manager to install the `mtr` package. On Linux, it should be called `mtr` or `mtr-tiny`, and on MacOS it will be called `mtr` (Homebrew is required).

#### Using MTR

On either operating system, run `mtr <serverip>`, replacing `<serverip>` with your actual server IP. Wait a few minutes and then copy the output to your clipboard.

## Low Network Throughput

In order to debug low download and/or upload speeds from your VPS, please install the official Speedtest CLI application found at [https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli). Once done, just run `speedtest` and check the result. Make sure that it is testing to a speedtest server local to your server, sometimes speedtest will default to a different country and/or region than your server is in, which can lead to inaccurate results. Once the speedtest is finished, please review the results and send it to our support if it is not matching expectations.

![Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/result/c/c53b9ef7-f701-49c2-b035-5a5a2cc8f1ce.png)

Note: Sometimes we see some of our customers run the `yabs.sh` benchmark script and report low throughput to some of the iperf3 destinations that this benchmark script uses. This is because some of the iperf3 servers can be overloaded or deprioritize our connections, hence why `iperf3` results are typically not the most accurate. If you would like to test to multiple destinations, we would highly recommend using a script like `bench.monster` or `network-speed.xyz`. These are third party scripts that we have not audited or validated, so check the source code and use them at your own risk.
