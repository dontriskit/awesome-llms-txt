Football has always been a game of passion, strategy, and unpredictability. But in recent years, data analysis has revolutionized how teams, analysts, and fans understand the sport. One of the most important metrics to come out of this revolution is Expected Goals, or xG. In this article, we will explore what xG is, how it works, and how it's transforming the world of football data analysis. We’ll also discuss how AI is enhancing football performance analysis, making it easier for coaches to track player performance, assess goal-scoring opportunities, and improve strategies. What is xG in Football? Expected Goals (xG) is a statistical model used in football to measure the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal. The xG value is based on several factors, including the distance from the goal, the angle of the shot, and the type of assist leading to the shot. Essentially, xG quantifies the quality of a goal-scoring chance. For example, a shot taken from the penalty spot would have a higher xG value compared to a long-range shot from outside the box. The model evaluates various aspects of each shot, such as: Distance to the goal Angle of the shot Type of assist (e. g. , through ball, cross, set piece) Player's body position when taking the shot By compiling these variables, the xG metric provides an estimate of how likely a shot is to result in a goal, giving teams a clearer picture of a player's finishing ability and the quality of the...

Comparisonator platformu Trabzonspor’un şampiyon olduğu 2021-22 senesine ait verileri Avrupa’nın en önemli 5 liginin şampiyonları ile karşılaştırdı, analitik olarak bu istatistikleri anlamlandırdı. Avcı hocanın takımı için zaman zaman söylenen “çok yan pas yapıyor” teoremini Comparisonator platformu dünyanın en önemli şampiyon takımları ile aynı ameliyat masasına yatırdı. Hepsi maç başı verilerine göre Real Madrid, Milan, Man City, Bayern Münih, PSG ve Trabzonspor’un aşağıdaki verileri yan yana karşılaştırıldı: Yan Pas - Başarılı Yan Pas İleri Pas - Başarılı İleri Pas Rakip 3. Bölgeye Pas - Rakip 3. Bölgeye Başarılı Pas Buradan çıkan en önemli sonuç aslında yan pas yapan takımların hemen hemen aynı oranda ileri pas ile ve 3. bölgeye atılan ileri paslar ile eşit derecede olması idi. Yan pas yapılanmasının asıl amacı ise futbol literatüründe “Ava Hazırlık” olarak nitelendirilmekte, bu şekilde ortaya çıkarılmaya çalışılan boşluklardan da içeriye derinlemesine girme opsiyonlarını aranmakta. Devamlı surette dikey oyun ise genelde uzun toplarla ortaya çıkmakta, ama büyük takımlar tarafından artık tercih edilmemekte. Bunun en önemli örneklerinden biri de aslında “Tiki-Taka” yı İngiltere’ye getiren İspanyollar oldu. Bu pas futbolu sayesinde artık özellikle Premier Lig takımları bu alışkanlıklarını bırakarak Manchester City örneğini takip ederek uzun paslı oyunu tarihin derinliklerine gömmüş durumda. Maç başına ortalama yan pas incelemesinde Trabzonspor’un Avcı yönetiminde aslında bu takımlardan Milan haricinde çok daha az yan pasla oynadığını, 2021-22 sezonunda o zamanki lig sıralamalarında 2. olduğunu görüyorsunuz. Ama aynı zamanda “İleri Pas” ve “Rakip 3. Bölgeye Pas-ki bu da bir ileri pas çeşidi” verilerinin de yan pas tablosunun hemen hemen birebir aynı düzlemde olduğu...

### CompaGPT - Virtual Transfer: Advanced Player Transfer Simulation

One of the standout features of CompaGPT is its advanced player transfer simulation capability. Unlike traditional analytics tools that focus solely on performance metrics, CompaGPT takes a holistic approach by evaluating multiple factors that influence successful transfers.   Revolutionizing Player Recruitment with CompaGPT: The Future of Football Data Analysis In the highly competitive world of football, finding the right player for a team is more crucial than ever. Football clubs invest millions in player transfers, hoping to find the perfect fit to strengthen their squads. However, the process of identifying suitable players often relies heavily on video analysis, which, while helpful, presents a significant limitation. Videos showcase a player’s highlights but fail to provide a complete picture of how well the player will fit into a team’s tactical setup, playing style, and overall dynamics. This lack of context leaves scouts, recruiters, and coaches uncertain about whether a player can truly meet the team's needs. Similarly, football player agencies face challenges when presenting their clients to potential clubs. Although agencies often provide various data reports to illustrate a player’s abilities, these reports typically lack a mathematical or data-driven rationale to prove that the player is the right fit for a particular team. Without concrete evidence, convincing clubs to invest in a player becomes difficult, and the risk of costly transfer mistakes increases. This is where CompaGPT, developed by Comparisonator, steps in to transform the recruitment process. CompaGPT is an AI-powered tool designed to provide short, understandable, and data-driven reports within seconds....

### Comparisonator's COMPA Value Whitepaper

Revolutionizing the Football Players' Market Value The Comparisonator family is proud to announce its brand-new feature, the result of rigorous and lengthy research by its data science team. Accurately determining the market value of football players is of utmost importance, especially in today's increasingly speculative and high-priced market. When it comes to determining a professional football player's monetary value, we often rely on well-known reference websites or reports published by consultancy companies. Unfortunately, these figures are often determined arbitrarily by the overall assessment of a group of experts. Even though valuations from these references are considered acceptable, there are two major problems with them. Firstly, they might not be as accurate as we imagine, as there are significant discrepancies between the actual transfer fees or real valuations by the intended market and the figures provided by reference entities. Additionally, human bias can exist when determining these valuations, which are often not aligned with the players' actual sportive performance. Secondly, the human assessment process is complicated and conflicted, leading to infrequent updates in the valuations. This means that it can take months, sometimes even tens of months, to learn the latest market value of a player. However, these outdated reference valuations may be extremely different from the player's actual performance. Having a tool that provides instant value estimates of players aligned with their recent performance on the field with pinpoint accuracy has been a long-sought goal for researchers and the market. Although various attempts have been made to derive econometric models...

### Why everyone thinks Messi performs less in Argentina compared to his Ligue 1 performance?

- Categories: Analysis, Blog

By Tarkan Batgun, CEO-Comparisonator The answer is very simple. Messi gets fewer passes from his teammates in Argentina National team compared to his domestic competition in Paris St Germain and UEFA Championship games. The graphics on the cover page shows all the comparisons covering his domestic league, UEFA competitions, and his current Argentina National Team performance side by side. He is the maestro of the opposition, third in domestic and UEFA games with Paris. But it is fairly different in Argentina National team. He comes back, collects balls, drives the ball to the third, and expects balls when he gets to the box. When he gets the ball around the box, he kills it. Indeed, besides the artificial intelligence within the Comparisonator platform, eyes can also see this. Let's have a look at the actual numbers which prove this: Lionel receives 65. 8 passes from his teammates on average per 90 minutes in French League 1Lionel receives 53. 2 passes from his teammates in Argentina That makes 19% less passes in the national team. How does this less pass ratio affect his performance? Let's see the comparisonator ai calculations: His overall performance in Argentina National Team is 30% less compared to his league performanceHis offensive performance in Argentina National Team is 23% less compared to his league performanceHis passing index is 58% less compared to his league performance Even under these circumstances, Messi scored an average of 0. 65 goals per 90 minutes in his National Team, compared to his...

- Categories: Whitepapers
- Translation Priorities: Optional

An Unbiased Player Performance Index Reducing performance of a player to a single scalar value is perhaps the single most valuable holy grail of the sports data industry. In fact, crafting and communicating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) constitutes the backbone of efficient measurements for almost all sectors in the market. Football media is no stranger to the concept since its beginnings. Journalists have been publishing their perceived scores of players since decades. With the advent of the football data revolution the possibility of using computer algorithms to attain much more objective and accurate indicators became a reality. Using the abundant raw event data, various sports tech companies have developed their own KPIs based on specific algorithms, however it is not a secret that these numbers do not satisfy the industry; found to be too biased (over-valuing certain types of actions etc. ) or inaccurate (being far from the definition of a performant player that a scout has in mind). Comparisonator was founded on this very basis; being aware how scouts, journalists and agents were in need for a near faultless KPI for player performances. Our data science team invested heavily in the subject. Spending countless hours in years to create the “perfect index”; the master index to satisfy all, scouts, journalists, agents, investors, fans, even players themselves, practically everyone in the football universe.   Effective Use of Machine Learning and AI Techniques Our research team composed of expert scholars in the field has leveraged the state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial...

### Everton can repeat tactic that has already beaten Manchester United with trio set for key roles

A look at the different roles Idrissa Gueye, Amadou Onana and Alex Iwobi could play in what could prove to be a key midfield battle for Everton against Manchester United The last time Everton and Manchester United met at Goodison Park, Anthony Gordon’s deflected goal ensured the hosts were first past the post on Grand National Day but how might the Blues try and go about trying to overcome the Red Devils this time? Some of Everton’s famous Goodison triumphs over Manchester United in the Premier League era have come through the effective deployment of a player who was aerially dominant. Duncan Ferguson nodded in Gwladys Street winners over 10 years apart while Marouane Fellaini – who would later make the switch to Old Trafford – repeated the trick in the club’s opening fixture of the 2012/13 season, which would prove to be manager David Moyes’ last before he too moved down the East Lancs Road. Many Evertonians would probably love to have Dominic Calvert-Lewin fit and firing to attempt a repeat of the kind of goal he grabbed at the same end against Crystal Palace in May to secure the Blues’ top flight status, especially with United centre-back Lisandro Martinez being less than 5ft 9in tall but the centre-forward still hasn’t kicked a ball this term. Gordon, the match-winner last time out, will be vying with the likes of Demarai Gray and Dwight McNeil – whose goal secured Everton’s 2-1 victory at Southampton in their previous match – for a place in the starting line-up having started on the bench at St...

### IS ANDRES GUARDADO A LOT FOR LIGA MX OR IS IT THE OPPOSITE?

- Categories: Blog

Although the numbers and the Atlas do not believe in him, the 'Little Prince' continues in the best events Does Liga MX fall short for Andrés Guardado or is the player no longer at the level of Mexican soccer?  The 'Little Prince' comes from being a starter in the Europa League , but the truth is that he plays less and less at Betis. Age is just a number and besides, even numbers can be misleading, otherwise it is not explained how the veteran midfielder continues to play at the highest level and continues to start in some high-demand games, when his general ratings would not even be top in Mexican soccer. The contribution of the 'Little Prince' at Betis is so special that not even the statistics can understand it, but could Andres still shine in Mexican soccer if he decided to return in 2023 once his contract with the Spanish team ended?  Atlas thinks not and the numbers suggest the same, but for some reason he is about to play his fifth World Cup with the Mexican National Team. But if Guardado wants to play one last time in Liga MX, he must make the decision now. Bad timing, but Andrés Guardado equaled Claudio Suárez's legendary record With his contributions on the pitch during the previous season at Betis, how would Andrés do in Liga MX?  The Comparisonator app ranks it outside the top 10. · It would be number 12 among all players in his position · But he would be number...

### What does the comparison between Aris and AEK show ahead of the derby?

- Categories: Blog

Vassilis Sambrakos compares through the Comparisonator the data of Ari's home performance with that of AEK's away performance. After 6 matches, the points difference that separates them - AEK's +2 creates the feeling that so far they don't have a big difference in efficiency.  However, the comparison of the performance data of the two teams in the league shows significant differences in the quality of the game.  Naturally, a team that works from the beginning of the season with the same coach, AEK, evolves its game model.  The football players understand the principles of the game, get to know each other, familiarize themselves with the roles the coach gives them on the field and start learning how to solve the problems presented in the matches and thus AEK's game evolves and improves.  Naturally, the other team, which has changed three coaches in the same period, is still in the first phase of its game changes, When one compares, through the Comparisonator, what Aris and AEK have done so far in the 6 matches, one finds an superiority of AEK in all parameters of the game.  He circulates the ball better and has better quality possession, creates more attacks, more final attempts, scores more goals.  And it excels in all parameters of the defense phase, as well as in duels - offensive and defensive. In a more specific comparison, i. e. in a simulation of the conditions of the Sunday derby, when one compares the home performance of Aris with the...

### U23 national team Mozzart Bet Superliga: Nikša master of dribbling, Stanojev and Kangva pack, Petković and Belić arrest￼

- Categories: Blog

Not everyone is in the ideal 11, but... The bonus rule in the Mozzart Bet Super League is set at 21, but in the world you are still considered a young player when you are 23 years old.  Although in Serbia it is often said that it is already too late for a major European trophy, it is not true that foreigners - perhaps not the biggest clubs - do not follow what is happening in that era.  Analytical platform Comparisonator thus dealt with the performance of U23 players in the course of the season so far, and although statistics can be deceiving, they can also direct the spotlight on players who may have gone under the radar until now. He will certainly not give universal answers, because just as there are several coaching schools, there are also different football philosophies.  Those with a mathematical mind will try to show everything in excel tables, those with a more casual attitude towards numbers will wave their hands and say that football is not something that can be easily calculated. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, so statistical data should not be dismissed in advance, although some "discoveries" will certainly surprise you, as they did us. Let's say, in one of the five parameters that Comparisonator dealt with , Nikša Vujanović stood out as the best dribbler among U23 Mozzart Bet Superliga players.  The Montenegrin football player, only the more attentive followers of the domestic championship would know that he plays for Voždovac, in 90 minutes...

Firmino Out, Jota In Jurgen Klopp selected Diogo Jota instead of Roberto Firmino in his game preference this season. Diogo Jota seems to have met the expectations with his performance this season, especially for Klopp, who was looking for a more effective offensive option and Firmino’s goals in the last two seasons remained in single digits. The Portuguese player scored 14 goals in all competitions this season and he doubled Firmino in the number of goals. When we compare Jota’s current seasonal parameters vs Firmino, it seems that Jota has a great advantage in general performance, especially in offensive parameters. The graphic below shows a comparison of Jota vs Firmino in offensive parameters with 2021-2022 season so far. New Model Fabinho The Brazilian midfielder is having his best scoring season since signing for Liverpool. In the Merseyside team, which he was transferred in the summer of 2018, there is a great improvement of Fabinho’s attacking parameters in this season. To understand Fabinho’s improvement, we compared his offensive parameters in 2019/20 season against this current season which seems like his second-most productive season with Liverpool. *(The left column of the picture shows the 2021/22 season stats, the right column shows the 2019/20 season stats) Results and stats show that; Fabinho has now turned into an additional offensive weapon from being a strong defensive playmaker, and he re-started to use his offensive effectiveness very efficiently and accurately. The Brazilian player has already ascended the 2019/20 season performance data in parameters such as...

Each player transfer within the global football family has its own unique story. From my playing life to this date, I  heard so many interesting transfer stories. Indeed, I was involved in some of those transfers myself while I was in the football clubs as a transfer authority. The main reason behind the invension of Comparisonator platform was to try to solve one particular problem:“The player we want to transfer to our team would actually perform in our team? ” This is everybody’s problem in football. Many millions of euros/dollars are lost due to wrong transfers. We created a feature called “Virtual Transfer” inside our platform to try to solve this problem by creating a very simple mechanism. Lets take the stats of the player in many parameters, move them into another league to compare with the players in the same position. Of course we knew that dynamics from one league to another changes.

Well, let me tell you a real story of how Frank Ribery was transfered to Fiorentina:My good mate Nicola Innocentin made a phone call to me in 2019. Asked me this question: “Tarkan, I have the possibility to move Frank Ribery to Fiorentina.

A Premier Football Player Similarity Search Engine Backed by AI Comparisonator team is proud and happy to present its brand new home-bred football player similarity search engine developed by its AI engineers, a refined result of a 1 year R&D effort. Finding the ‘twins’ in playing style and profile around the globe for a footballer you query. Scouts always prefer to think in terms of ‘similarity’ while looking for talents, either for a hot prospect in youth teams or a world-class transfer candidate in top  1-tier leagues. However, this is a more cumbersome task than it seems, as the notion of ‘similarity’ is a highly subjective matter. Apart from sports analytics, due to this lack of universality, similarity measurements constitute one of the most complex subfields of all mathematical applications. A Revolutionary Algorithm Comparisonator Team has put on particular emphasis on finding players with similar playing styles using on-field digital indicators. We were aware of the high degree of demand from our a priori discussions with numerous chief scouts all around the world. Therefore, our AI task force was mobilised to develop a satisfying product around a year ago. We opted to use all the state-of-the-art deep learning and data science techniques, which resulted in a promising and innovative architecture; both for our customers and academic research in AI. Scouts and professionals from football industry always rest fully integral in the development of every Comparisonator product with their valuable feedbacks, which was also the case for our AI similarity algorithm....

### Derbi Analizi: Fenerbahçe vs Galatasaray

Verilere dayalı olarak konuşursak eğer, Fatih hoca kendi bildiği oyunu oynarsa kazanır. İş burada Erol Bulut’ta. Erol hoca oyununu değiştirmeye ne kadar yakın? Taktiksel değişikliğe gidebilecek mi? İşte bu hamleyi Erol hoca yaparsa, o zamanda iş Kanarya’ya döner..

Satrancı Doğru Oynayan Kazanacak Verilere dayalı olarak konuşursak eğer, Fatih hoca kendi bildiği oyunu oynarsa kazanır. İş burada Erol Bulut’ta. Erol hoca oyununu değiştirmeye ne kadar yakın? Taktiksel değişikliğe gidebilecek mi? İşte bu hamleyi Erol hoca yaparsa, o zamanda iş Kanarya’ya döner. . Hep aynı şeylerle başlıyorum ya, yine aynısı. “Derbinin galibini bilebilmek için geleceğe gidip görmek lazım”. Yani ne söylersek söyleyelim en iyi zamanların Galatasaray’ının Kanarya’ya kaybettiğini, en iyi zamanların Fenerbahçe’sinin de Cimbom’a kaybettiği zamanları hepimiz gördük. Zaman birçok şeyi değiştiriyor. Artık maçların analizinde de rakamlar büyük önem taşıyor. Tüm takımlarda analiz birimleri var. Tabiki maç sahada kazanılıyor ama matematiğin özellikle teknolojinin ilerleyişi ve data endüstrisinin futbol tarafından keşfi ufukları olmayan yep yeni bir sanal saha yarattı. Birbirlerine yakın kadrolar kuran takımlarda data analizi çok daha önem kazanıyor. Neticede %50’ye %50 beraberlik yaratırken, %51’i yakalayan maçı kazanıyor. Biz de Comparisonator platformu ile sizlere değişik alanlarda karşılaştırmalar yaptık, bilimi kullanarak sizlere yeni bir perspektif açmaya çalıştık. Comparisonator SWOT Analizi Fenerbahçe’nin hücümdaki en üstün özelliği hava hakimiyeti. Kanaryalar 9 golü kafayla ve genelde yandan gelen ortalarla skora yansıtmış. Fakat Galatasaray’ında defansta kafa toplarında tartışmasız üstünlüğü var. Fenerbahçe topu yere indirirse galibiyete ulaşması daha olası. Galatasaray ise attığı gollerin 25’ini ceza sahasında gerçekleştirmiş. Fenerbahçe’nin en sıkıntılı bölgesi kendi ceza sahası. Ölümcül bölgede 17 gol yemişler. Yani taktiksel oyun aynı kalırsa, Galatasaray kendi hücüm ortalamalarını tuttururda Kanarya’nın ceza sahasına inebilirse galibiyete yakın taraf olacaktır. Eğer taktikler aynı kalırsa Galatasaray ağır basacaktır. Ama Erol hoca topu özellikle hücumda yere indirirse bireysel zaaflardan yararlanabilir. Bunun...

If Terim plays the game as he usually does, If he plays similar to what he played so far this season, Gala has the better chance to win. If someone should change the game style, that should be made by Fenerbahce Head Coach Erol Bulut. How close is Bulut to change his usual tactics? If Bulut makes the right moves & tactical changes, then the game might turn to Yellow Canaries. We interpreted the visuals coming from the Comparisonator tool..

Right Moves Will Win The Chess Game If Terim plays the game as he usually does, If he plays similar to what he played so far this season, Gala has the better chance to win. If someone should change the game style, that should be made by Fenerbahce Head Coach Erol Bulut. How close is Bulut to change his usual tactics? If Bulut makes the right moves & tactical changes, then the game might turn to Yellow Canaries. We interpreted the visuals coming from the Comparisonator tool. . Change in Football Analytics We have to travel through the future in order to guess the winner of any derby game. We all saw the most glorious times of Galatasaray losing to Canaries and witnessed the best times of Fenerbahçe losing to Cimbom. Nowadays the numbers are of great importance in match analysis. All teams have analysis departments. Of course, the matches are won on the field, but the advancement of mathematics combined with technology, and the discovery of the data industry by football teams have created a brand new virtual game field that has no horizons. Due to Covid crises teams are forced to keep budgets in tact. The squads are not as wide. If the performance of teams are 50% vs 50%, you get the draw. 51% performance wins matches. That vital 1% is the game changer. And I believe that comes from the data comparison tools. We conducted analysis using Comparisonator platform and tried to open a new perspective...
