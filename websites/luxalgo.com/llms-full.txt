The AI Backtesting Assistant is able to fetch our product documentation to provide relevant information to you about the features used by a retrieved strategy or to simply help you learn more about our products.

The AI will automatically determine whether it requires fetching context from the documentation depending on the user query.

<Tip>
  You can force the AI to fetch information from the documentation by telling it to fetch the documentation.

  For example:

  > Tell me more about confirmation signals, use the documentation

  This can prevent the AI from giving partial information he might know from his existing context window.
</Tip>

## Detailed Strategy Descriptions Using Docs

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesting-assistant/fetching-information/explanation.png)

We can request for the AI to provide important context about the conditions returned by a trading strategy.

## Using Docs to Get Tailored Strategies

By asking the AI to learn more about the LuxAlgo features from the documentation, we can effectively get unique trading strategies by simply mentioning trading styles.

For example, we can use the following prompt:

> From the documentation search for the best features for swing trading, then find a strategy using those features that provides good results on crypto on the hourly timeframe

The primary role of the AI Backtesting Assistant is to help users find strategies quickly without having to iterate through various conditions, tickers, and timeframes on TradingView charts. Instead, users can simply ask the AI to look for the strategy that would best match the criteria they want.

The AI Backtesting Assistant has access to thousands of unique strategies, half using our S\&O toolkit and the other half using our PAC toolkit.

## Strategies Configuration

Strategies accessible by the AI Backtesting Assistant are backtested using an initial capital of 10,000\$, without commissions/slippage, and using default settings (except for the PAC which uses a different invalidation behavior).

Unit position sizing is used across all tickers, except forex pairs which use a standard lot (100,000 units).

The strategies the AI can access don't use every single one of the features within the toolkits, see the section below to learn more about the supported tickers, timeframes, and backtesting conditions.

<Info>
  Strategies do note make use of stop losses or take profits.

## How To Fetch Strategies

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/ai-backtesting/fetching-strategies/landing.png)

Interacting with the AI Backtesting Assistant is straightforward. All users need to do is type a prompt in the chat box located at the bottom of their screen.

Here are examples of prompts that will trigger the AI Backtesting Assistant to retrieve a trading strategy:

* What is the best performing strategy across all crypto tickers on the 5-minute timeframe?
* Give me three strategies using fair value gaps that have a winrate above 80%.
* Find a strategy with above average net profit but below average drawdown.

Users can also click on one of the suggested prompts in the search group located above the input prompt.

The AI can access the following backtesting results for strategies:

* Net Profit
* Max Net Profit
* Closed Trades
* Winning Trades
* Losing Trades
* Winrate
* Gross Profit
* Gross Loss
* Profit Factor
* Max Drawdown
* Max Drawdown Percent
* Average Trade
* Average Winning Trade
* Average Losing Trade

![Strategy Results](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/ai-backtesting/fetching-strategies/table.png)

These results will be returned in a table display within the chat. If multiple strategies are returned, they will all be located within that table. The AI can occasionally fetch strategies in the middle of a response; this will return another table containing the strategies fetched.

<Info>
  A maximum of 3 strategies can be returned in a table at once, while a maximum of three strategies can be returned from a single fetching operation.

  If the AI needs to fetch more than 3 strategies it will fetch strategies in parallel.
</Info>

The AI has also access to the following information from a strategy:

* Strategy start time: When the strategy started being evaluated
* Strategy current position (long, short, or none)

### Fetch Statistics Across The Entire Strategy Population

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/ai-backtesting/fetching-strategies/compare.png)

The AI can also get general statistics and data across the whole population of strategies being backtested.

Example of prompts doing this are:

* What is the total net profit of all bitcoin strategies you have?
* On BTCUSD, are strategies using normal Confirmation signals better than the ones using strong Confirmation signals overall?
* What is total net profit of profitable strategies across stocks?

This can be useful to get big picture information about strategies.

<Info>
  Do note that such prompts can lead to high wait time for the results.
</Info>

## Add a Strategy to Your Chart

Once you get a strategy you like from our AI, you may be inclined to add it to your chart to visualize it & further optimize its results on TradingView.

To do so, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add The Backtester To The Chart">
    Go to your TradingView chart, then open the indicator menu, locate the Backtester of the Toolkit related to the strategy you want to add. For example, if you found a strategy with our AI Backtesting Assistant that used Signals & Overlays, you would add the "Backtester (S\&O)" strategy script to your TradingView chart.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust Backtesting Starting Time">
    Go in the Backtester's settings, then select "Date" in the "Backtest Window" setting, then adjust "Window Start" with the strategy start time provided by AI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select The Conditions">
    Adjust the long and short entry conditions in the backtester based on the conditions returned by the AI.

    <Important>
      Make sure to use "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" in the "Invalidation behavior" dropdowns for PAC strategies.
    </Important>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  We compute strategies using our own data, which can differ from the one on Tradingview. Users might not be able to reproduce exact strategy results due to the limitation on how much data certain users can access.
</Warning>

## Saving Strategies

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/ai-backtesting/fetching-strategies/saving.png)

Users can export strategies displayed within a table as a csv using the download icon located under it.

## Prompting Tips

The AI can make mistakes when fetching strategies, as this is a very complex process depending on the user query.

We will always aim to improve the AI Backtesting Assistant over time; however, the following tips can help you get the most from our AI.

### Make Detailed Queries

Make sure to detail every aspect of the strategy you want to fetch if you have a precise one in mind, for example:

| Original                                                     | Improved                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fetch a strategy that uses Confirmation Signals              | Fetch a strategy that only uses Confirmation Signals and no other conditions                                                 |
| I want a PAC strategy that goes long on a new FVG, and CHoCH | I want a PAC strategy that goes long when:<br /><br />- Step 1: a new bullish FVG occur<br />- Step 2: a bullish CHoCH occur |
| I want the best strategy                                     | I want the strategy with the highest net profit on BTCUSDT 5 minute                                                          |

Context and details will help the AI avoid making guesses about your query.

### Encourage the AI to Improve

The AI Backtesting Assistant can be fairly self-aware if a fetched strategy doesn't meet a user criteria, and will then retry.

But if the AI response is clearly mistaken, then it can be good to let it know using a prompt encouraging re-evaluation of the fetching process:

> The strategy your returned is not the one I want. Correct the issue in your fetching process and retry to fetch the strategy in accordance with my query.

### Split Complex Queries Into Multiple Tasks

The AI will be more prone to mistakes if the query is complex, as such, it is best to do follow-up messages asking about the details of a strategy rather than asking the AI to give those alongside other information.

For example:

> Return a good strategy on BTCUSD, alongside the average net profit of all strategies on BTCUSD that use Confirmation signals, then tell me what the highest winrate strategy is, using the same conditions as the first one

The AI Backtesting Assistant might provide more relevant answers if we let context accumulate by splitting and re-ordering our initial query into multiple ones:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Query">
    Return a good strategy on BTCUSD
  </Step>

  <Step title="Second Query">
    Find the strategy with the highest winrate that use the same exact entry conditions returned previously
  </Step>

  <Step title="Third Query">
    Return the average net profit of all strategies on BTCUSD that use Confirmation Signals.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Troubleshooting
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/ai-backtesting/troubleshooting



The AI Backtesting Assistant is an early feature, and such might face several limitations described in this page.

<Note>
  Don't hesitate to send your feedback at [support@luxalgo.com](mailto:support@luxalgo.com) or in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/LUX).
</Note>

## I can't use the AI Backtesting Assistant

The AI Backtesting assistant is only available for our Ultimate users. Users without a plan can purchase one [here](https://www.luxalgo.com/pricing/).

Users subscribed to the Essential and Premium plans will need to upgrade to the Ultimate plan to use the AI Backtesting Assistant.

## The AI is not responding to my message

To ensure fair and consistent access to the AI Backtesting Assistant, users are subject to rate limits defined in terms of concurrent requests.

If the maximum number of concurrent requests is exceeded, messages sent to the AI Backtesting Assistant will take longer to get answered.

Waiting for some time will generally resolve the issue.

## Reached maximum monthly usage for the AI Backtesting Assistant

Because of the amount of compute necessary to run our LLM and to prevent potential abuse, users have a limited usage of the AI Backtesting Assistant.

The amount of usage is determined by the amount of content returned by the AI, as such large messages can consume more usage than more frequent small messages.

The monthly usage is reset every first of the month.

<Tip>
  In order to significantly save on usage you can refresh the page to clear the chat, as generating new messages on large conversations will drain usage more quickly.

  You can also use a lighter model like 2.0 FLash or 2.0 FLash Lite to reduce usage.
</Tip>

## I am seeing very different strategy results on Tradingview

We compute strategies using our own data, which can differ from the one on Tradingview. Users might also not be able to reproduce exact strategy results due to the limitation on how much data they can access.

On some occasions, you might have closer results by enabling "After order is filled", "On every tick", and/or "Using bar magnifier" in the strategy properties, in the **RECALCULATE** and **FILL ORDERS** sections.

Users can get alerted for any action executed by a strategy, from opening positions to closing them. The way alerts work is the same across all the Backtester scripts.

The message field in the **Alert Messages** setting section of each Backtester allows for the strategy to send a custom alert message depending on the action taken by the strategy, if no messages are set the strategy will send default messages.

In order for alerts to return custom user set messages the `{{strategy.order.alert_message}}` should be set on the message field of the Tradingview alert menu.

<Note>
  Backtester (PAC) does not have Exit Long/Short TP/SL alerts, instead only having Exit Long/Short
</Note>

## Alerts Placeholders

Users can use placeholders in the messages set from the **Alert Messages** setting section to return market data, take profit/stop losses values, chart ticker and timeframe...etc.

# Forecasting
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/forecasting



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/forecasting/settings.png)

Being able to anticipate where price might evolve after a trade can be useful to plan potential exit points, set take profits/stop loss as well as knowing when user set ones might get hit...etc.

All Backtesters include a forecasting tool able to provide forecasts from the most recent trade executed by the backtester.

## Using Forecasts

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/forecasting/forecasting.png)

Forecasts can be enabled from the "FORECAST" settings group by enabling the "Show Forecast" toggle.

Each forecast is influenced by the price evolution made during previous respective long and short trades, as such forecasts for long positions are different from the ones of short positions.

Users can select the maximum length of forecast using the "Forecasting Length" setting.

<Note>
  Because of the forecasting algorithm used, forecasts can have a lower length than the one selected by the user depending on the average bars in trade.

  Very frequent trades will generally return short price forecasts due to the lack of available data.
</Note>

### Forecasting Area

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/forecasting/area.png)

By default, forecasts are displayed alongside an area, indicating where future prices might evolve. The area extremities can help users potentially determines exit points with there interaction with the price, but can also help reference the performance of a current trade relative to past trades.

Areas extremities are representative of past trades performances. For example:

* For long positions: A lower extremity not significantly going below the entry price can indicate good past performance for long positions.
* For short positions: An upper extremity not significantly going above the entry price can indicate good past performance for short positions.

<Note>
  If an area is no longer visible in a point in time of the forecast it means that there is not enough data for that point in time.
</Note>

### Forecasting Memory

Users can control the influence older trades have on the forecast using the "Maximum Forecast Memory" setting, with lower values using a shorter term memory, discarding older information more quickly.

Low values of this setting allow obtaining more diverse forecasts for new trades, while higher values will return forecasts less subject to change over time.

### Take Profits Levels From Forecast

When forecasts are displayed, users can set take profits using the **nth** percentile of a returned forecast. This can be done from the "TPS & SLS" settings, by selecting "Forecast" in the "Long TP" and/or "Short TP".

The numerical setting selected at the right of the drop-down menus determines the percentile used, and should be set within the range \[0, 100] in order to work. Percentiles values can affect the returned levels as follows:

* In case of a long trade, a lower set percentile will return take profits closer to the entry price, potentially triggering sooner.
* In case of a short trade, a lower set percentile will return take profits further away from the entry price, potentially triggering later.

<Warning>
  Do note that because forecasts are based on the strategy entries, take profits levels based on it can be subject to repainting, except when using a backtesting window based on a date.
</Warning>


# Entry Rules
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/osc/entry



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/osc/entry/settings.png)

Backtester (OSC) allows users to set their own long/short entry rules from features of the Oscillator Matrix® as well as external indicators.

Entry rules can be created separately for both long and short entries, and can be set using up to 8 different user set conditions. Each can be enabled by toggling them on using the toggle input on the left of each condition, if the enabled conditions are valid, the strategy will open a corresponding market order.

## Oscillator Matrix® Conditions

Conditions for 6 features of the Oscillator Matrix® are included. These include:

* Money Flow conditions
* OverFlow conditions
* HyperWave conditions
* Reversal conditions
* Divergences conditions
* Confluence conditions

The first dropdown determines the specific condition used for that feature, these can include generic conditional operators such as `Greater Than` or `Crossing`, or conditions proper to certain features such as `Any Bullish` in the HyperWave conditions.

The second input setting allows the user to enter a numerical values, which is used when `Greater Than`, `Lower Than`, `Equal`, `Crossing Over`, `Crossing Under`, or `Crossing` are used.

For example, if the user wants to go **Long** when the HyperWave oscillator crosses over 80, the following settings would be used:

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/osc/entry/example-osc.png)

## External Conditions

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/osc/entry/externals.png)

Users can use the output of external indicators on the chart as input to set entry conditions.

The second dropdown of external condition settings determines which conditional operator to use on both external outputs. These include:

* Greater Than
* Lower Than
* Equal
* Crossing Over
* Crossing Under
* Crossing

The third external condition works similarly, but instead of comparing two external outputs, the condition will compare an external output specified in the condition first dropdown with a user set value in the third dropdown using a conditional operator set on the second dropdown. This last condition is particularly useful for oscillators.

Here is an example of the third external condition being set for an RSI crossing over 50.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/osc/entry/example-external.png)

## Using Conditions Together

More complex entry rules can be created by using multiple conditions together, this is done thanks to the **Step** dropdown setting on the right of each condition (below each condition for conditions 4 and 5).

The *Step* setting is directly related to the Step & Match algorithm and work in two ways:

* When two or more conditions have the same step number, both conditions are evaluated. Used to test matching conditions.
* When two or more conditions have different step numbers, each conditions will be evaluated in order, testing for the first step and switching to the next step once the previous one is true. When the final step is true, the strategy will open a market order. Used to create a sequence of conditions.

This operation is complementary, as you can create a sequence of conditions with one step consisting of two or more matching conditions as long as they have the same step number.

<Tip>
  A user wanting to go long when a bullish divergence occurs after any bullish reversal while money flow was bullish (over 50) could do it as follows:

  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/pac/entry/example-stepmatch.png)
</Tip>

### Invalidate Step

The "Invalidate" step allows setting a condition as an "invalidation condition". When this condition is triggered while a sequence of conditions is incomplete, the sequence will restart at step 1.

If multiple steps are set as "Invalidate" any of the conditions being true will reset the sequence of conditions, as such not all of them are required to be true for the sequence of conditions to reset.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 2 regular steps and one "Invalidate" step. The position will be opened when step 2 trigger after step 1 has been triggered.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Invalidation Step">
      Invalidation step condition trigger, we reset the sequence and evaluate step 1 just after.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

### Invalidation Behaviors

Invalidation behaviors allow adding more restrictions to a sequence of conditions; users can use two different invalidation behaviors described below:

#### Invalidate On Step 1

The "Invalidate On Step 1" behavior allows resetting an incomplete sequence of conditions when the condition on step 1 triggers. This prevents the first step condition from happening in between other steps of the condition sequence.

This behavior is useful when the first step of our sequence of conditions needs to never be repeated during the sequence.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.

#### Invalidate On Any Repeated Step

The "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when a step is triggered such that it does not respect the set order of conditions.

This behavior is useful when we want a perfectly ordered sequence of conditions to complete, without any step repeating itself.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">
      Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 1 or 2 Trigger">
      Step 1 or 2 conditions trigger, we start evaluating step 1 from now.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

## No Existing Positions Requirement

Users can enable the **Don't Allow Trades Until Closed** setting in order to only open trade when no existing positions are open. This setting allows waiting for a position to be closed before one can be opened.

<Note>
  Enabling **Don't Allow Trades Until Closed** for long positions will prevent opening shorts as long as a long position is opened.

  If this same setting is not enabled for short conditions then shorts can effectively be closed by new long positions.
</Note>


# Exit Conditions
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/osc/exits



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/osc/exits/settings.png)

Users can close any position on a profit or loss using specific crossing conditions obtained from external sources. Exits conditions can be enabled in the **EXIT CONDITIONS** settings section.

<Note>
  Oscillators are intended to be used as external source when it comes to TP/SL conditions, but users can directly create scripts returning scaled outputs from overlay indicators.
</Note>

### Exit Take Profit

Long/Short take profits exits conditions will exit a long or short position when a set condition is met such that the position exit on a profit.

Take profits conditions are triggered if they are toggled on for a specific order (Long/Short) and if the selected external source is either **Crossing**, **Crossing Up**, or **Crossing Down**, **Greater Than**, **Lower Than**, or **Equal** to the numerical value specified by the user.

### Exit Stop Losses

Long/Short stop losses exits conditions will exit a long or short order when a set condition is met such that the position exit on a loss.

Stop losses conditions are triggered if they are toggled on for a specific order (Long/Short) and if the selected external source is either **Crossing**, **Crossing Up**, or **Crossing Down**, **Greater Than**, **Lower Than**, or **Equal** to the numerical value specified by the user.

### Time Exits

Time exits allow users to exit trade from a specific time of the day. Note that trades are still exited at the opening of the next bar.

<Note>
  The timezone is the same as the one of the chart symbol.
</Note>

### Placeholders

![Exit Long Take Profit when closing price cross the upper Bollinger band extremity](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/osc/exits/placeholder.png)

Users who do not wish to use a numerical value to evaluate a condition with an external source may use a placeholder instead, which allows using prices. The following placeholders are supported:

* `open` : Opening price
* `high` : High price
* `low` : Low price
* `close` : Closing price
* `hl2` : <Tooltip tip="(high + low) / 2"> Median price </Tooltip>
* `ohlc4` : <Tooltip tip="(open + high + low + close) / 4"> Average price </Tooltip>
* `hlc3` : <Tooltip tip="(high + low + close) / 3"> Typical price </Tooltip>
* `hlcc4` : <Tooltip tip="(high + low + 2 * close) / 4"> Weighted price </Tooltip>

## Partial Exits

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/partial.png)

Users can exit a percentage of an existing position by specifying a percentage lower than 100%. This can lead to sequential exit, with reduced exposure each time an exit is triggered.


# Introduction
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/osc/introduction



Backtester (OSC) is a script that allows users to perform backtests using features from our [Oscillator Matrix®](/docs/toolkits/oscillator-matrix/introduction) toolkit. Users can create their own entry & exit conditions as well as control take-profit and stop-loss placement. Each core component of the backtester are described in the following pages:

# Take Profit & Stop Loss
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/osc/tpsl



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/tpsl.png)

Users can set take profits and stop losses orders allowing a certain degree of money management in the backtest. Take profits and stop loss orders can be enabled and adjusted from the **FIXED TPS & SLS** settings section.

<Note>
  Take profits and stop losses orders are placed relative to the price preceding a trade, and might not be filled at the exact price set by the user.
</Note>

## TP/SL Options

Take profits and stop losses for specific orders can be enabled from the toggles present in their settings section. Take profits and stop losses can be set using various methods described below:

|     Option    |                                                                                            Description                                                                                           |
| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|     Price     |                                                       <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders at the specified price.</div>                                                       |
|    Currency   |                <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified amount of currency away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                |
|     Ticks     |                  <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified amount of ticks away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                 |
|       %       |                    <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified percentage away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                    |
|      ATR      | <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders *N* average true ranges away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order, where *N* is a specified multiplier.</div> |
|    Forecast   |        <div align="left">(Only available for take profits orders) Use a percentile of a returned forecast to set take profits. Forecasts must be enabled in order for this to work.</div>        |
| Trailing Stop |                <div align="left">(Only available for stop loss orders) Enable a percentage based trailing stop. A position will be exited if price reach the trailing stop.</div>                |

<Note>
  The average true range used to set take profits/stop losses orders make use of a period of 200 bars.
</Note>

### Trailing Stop

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/trailing.png)

Users can use a percentage based trailing stop to exit positions. The trailing stop will move in the direction of interest if its distance with the low price(in case of long positions) or high price (in case of short positions) is greater than the specified percentage.

### Take Profits Levels From Forecast

When forecasts are displayed, users can set take profits using the **nth** percentile of a returned forecast. This can be done from the "TPS & SLS" settings, by selecting "Forecast" in the "Long TP" and/or "Short TP".

The numerical setting selected at the right of the drop-down menus determines the percentile used, and should be set within the range \[0, 100] in order to work. Percentiles values can affect the returned levels as follows:

* In case of a long trade, a lower set percentile will return take profits closer to the entry price, potentially triggering sooner.
* In case of a short trade, a lower set percentile will return take profits further away from the entry price, potentially triggering later.

<Warning>
  Do note that because forecasts are based on the strategy entries, take profits levels based on it can be subject to repainting, except when using a backtesting window based on a date.
</Warning>


# Entry Rules
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/pac/entry



Backtester (PAC) allows users to set their own long/short entry rules from price action related concepts as well as external indicators. Entry rules can be built as sequences of conditions, matching conditions, or a mix of both. More details are provided in the section below.

Entry rules can be created separately for both long and short entries, and can be set using up to 6 different user set conditions. Each can enabled by toggling them on using the toggle input on the left of each condition, if the enabled conditions are valid, the strategy will open a corresponding market order.

Three types of distinct conditions are available, each described in the sections below.

## Price Action Conditions

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/pac/entry/pac-settings.png)

Conditions 1, 2, and 3 work the same way, and allow using conditions from market structures, volumetric order blocks, imbalances, and liquidity grabs.

The first dropdown includes options: *Bullish* and *Bearish*, and determines the origin of the selected condition in the second dropdown.

The second dropdown includes the list of price action related conditions, these include:

|      Condition      |                        Description                       |
| :-----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
|     CHoCH or BOS    | Triggered on a change of character or break of structure |
|        CHoCH        |            Triggered on a change of character            |
|         BOS         |             Triggered on a break of structure            |
|     Mitigated OB    |       Triggered once price mitigates an order block      |
|      Within OB      |  Triggered if price is within the area of an order block |
|      Entered OB     |  Triggered once price enters the area of an order block  |
|       Exit OB       |   Triggered once price exits the area of an order block  |
|  Entered Imbalance  |   Triggered once price enters the area of an imbalance   |
|   Within Imbalance  |   Triggered if price is within the area of an imbalance  |
| Mitigated Imbalance |        Triggered once price mitigates an imbalance       |
|    Exit Imbalance   |          Triggered once price exits an imbalance         |
|    Liquidity Grab   |        Triggered once a liquidity grab is detected       |

For example if the user wants to go **Long** when a new **Bullish** **CHoCH** the following settings would be used:

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/pac/entry/example-pac.png)

<Note>
  User can change the settings of each price action concept by scrolling down the settings, each concept has its own setting group. To learn more about each concept see:

  [Market Structures](/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/market-structures)

  [Order Blocks](/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/order-blocks)

  [Imbalances](/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/imbalances)

  [Liquidity Grabs](/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/liquidity)
</Note>

## External Conditions

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/pac/entry/external-settings.png)

Users can use the output of external indicators on the chart as input to set entry conditions.

The second dropdown of external condition settings determines which conditional operator to use on both external outputs. These include:

* Greater Than
* Lower Than
* Equal
* Crossing Over
* Crossing Under
* Crossing

The third external condition works similarly but instead of comparing two external outputs the condition will compare an external output specified in the condition first dropdown with a user set value in the third dropdown using a conditional operator set on the second dropdown. This last condition is particularly useful for oscillators.

Here is an example of the third external condition being set for price crossing over a simple moving average.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/pac/entry/example-external.png)

## Session Condition

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/pac/entry/session.png)

Condition 6 is a session condition, with an active status if current time is within the specified session interval.

<Note>
  Session timezone is the same as the one of the chart symbol exchange (UTC for cryptocurrencies)
</Note>

## Using Conditions Together

More complex entry rules can be created by using multiple conditions together, this is done thanks to the **Step** dropdown setting on the right of each condition (below each condition for conditions 4 and 5).

The *Step* setting is directly related to the Step & Match algorithm and work in two ways:

* When two or more conditions have the same step number, both conditions are evaluated. Used to test matching conditions.
* When two or more conditions have different step numbers, each conditions will be evaluated in order, testing for the first step and switching to the next step once the previous one is true. When the final step is true the strategy will open a market order. Used to create sequence of conditions.

This operation is complementary, as you can create a sequence of conditions with one step consisting of two or more matching conditions as long as they have the same step number.

<Tip>
  A user wanting to go long when a bullish break of structure occurs after price mitigated a bearish order block while price was above its 20 period moving average could do it as follows:

  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/pac/entry/example-stepmatch.png)
</Tip>

### Invalidate Step

The "Invalidate" step allows to set a condition as an "invalidation condition". When this condition is triggered while a sequence of conditions is incomplete, the sequence will restart at step 1.

If multiple steps are set as "Invalidate" any of the conditions being true will reset the sequence of conditions, as such not all of them are required to be true for the sequence of conditions to reset.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 2 regular steps and one "Invalidate" step. The position will be opened when step 2 trigger after step 1 has been triggered.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Invalidation Step">
      Invalidation step condition trigger, we reset the sequence and evaluate step 1 just after.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

### Invalidation Behaviors

Invalidation behaviors allows adding more restrictions to a sequence of conditions, users can use two different invalidation behaviors described below:

#### Invalidate On Step 1

The "Invalidate On Step 1" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when the condition on step 1 trigger. This prevents the first step condition from happening in between other steps of the condition sequence.

This behavior is useful when the first step of our sequence of conditions needs to never be repeated during the sequence.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">

#### Invalidate On Any Repeated Step

The "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when a step is triggered such that it does not respect the set order of conditions.

This behavior is useful when we want a perfectly ordered sequence of conditions to complete, without any step repeating itself.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">
      Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 1 or 2 Trigger">
      Step 1 or 2 conditions trigger, we start evaluating step 1 from now.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

## No Existing Positions Requirement

Users can enable the **Don't Allow Trades Until Closed** setting in order to only open trade when no existing positions are open. This setting allows waiting for a position to be closed before one can be opened.

<Note>
  Enabling **Don't Allow Trades Until Closed** for long positions will prevent opening shorts as long as a long position is opened.

  If this same setting is not enabled for short conditions then shorts can effectively be closed by new long positions.
</Note>


# Exit Rules
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/pac/exits



The strategy can include custom long/short orders exits rules. These can be created in a similar way than entry rules by using two available conditions, and can evaluate price action features as well as the output of external indicators on your chart.

## Price Action Conditions

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/pac/exits/settings.png)

Conditions *Exit Long 1* and *Exit Short 1* allow using conditions from market structures, volumetric order blocks, and imbalances.

The first dropdown includes options: *Bullish* and *Bearish* and determines the origin of the selected condition in the second dropdown.

The second dropdown includes the list of price action related conditions, these include:

|      Condition      |                        Description                       |
| :-----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
|     CHoCH or BOS    | Triggered on a change of character or break of structure |
|        CHoCH        |            Triggered on a change of character            |
|         BOS         |             Triggered on a break of structure            |
|     Mitigated OB    |       Triggered once price mitigates an order block      |
|      Within OB      |  Triggered if price is within the area of an order block |
|      Entered OB     |  Triggered once price enters the area of an order block  |
|  Entered Imbalance  |   Triggered once price enters the area of an imbalance   |
|   Within Imbalance  |   Triggered if price is within the area of an imbalance  |
| Mitigated Imbalance |        Triggered once price mitigates an imbalance       |

## External Conditions

Conditions *Exit Long 2* and *Exit Short 2*  allow the user to use the output of external indicators on the chart as input for setting exit conditions.

These allow setting a condition based on two different external indicators output, with The first and third dropdowns determining which external output to use.

The second dropdown determines which conditional operator to use on both external outputs. These include:

* Greater Than
* Lower Than
* Equal
* Crossing Over
* Crossing Under
* Crossing

## Using Conditions Together

More complex exit rules can be created by using multiple conditions together, this is done thanks to the **Step** dropdown setting on the right of each condition (below each condition for *Exit Long 2* and *Exit Short 2*).

The *Step* setting is directly related to the Step & Match algorithm and works in two ways:

* When two or more conditions have the same step number, both conditions are evaluated. Used to test matching conditions.
* When two or more conditions have different step numbers, each condition will be evaluated in order, testing for the first step and switching to the next step once the previous one is true. When the final step is true the strategy will open a market order. Used to create sequence of conditions.

This operation is complementary, as you can create a sequence of conditions with one step consisting of two or more matching conditions as long as they have the same step number.

## Time Exits

Time exits allow users to exit trade from a specific time of the day. Note that trades are still exited at the opening of the next bar.

<Note>
  The timezone is the same as the one of the chart symbol.
</Note>

## Partial Exits

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/partial.png)

Users can exit a percentage of an existing position by specifying a percentage lower than 100%. This can lead to sequential exit, with reduced exposure each time an exit is triggered.

## Only Exit On A Profit

Enabling "Only Exit On A Profit" allows only triggering an exit if this exit leads to a profit, effectively preventing any exit that would lead to a loss.

This can be useful to increase winrates of strategies.

<Tip>
  Enabling this setting alongside "Dont allow trades until closed" can prevent any losing trade from being exited, leading to a theoretical 100% winrate without a stop-loss.

  Do note however that a unprofitable trade can be held for an unlimited amount of time, leading to unrealistic scenarios.
</Tip>

# Take Profit & Stop Loss
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/pac/tpsl



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/tpsl.png)

Users can set take profits and stop losses orders allowing a certain degree of money management in the backtest. Take profits and stop loss orders can be enabled and adjusted from the **FIXED TPS & SLS** settings section.

<Note>
  Take profits and stop losses orders are placed relative to the price preceding a trade, and might not be filled at the exact price set by the user.
</Note>

## TP/SL Options

Take profits and stop losses for specific orders can be enabled from the toggles present in their settings section. Take profits and stop losses can be set using various methods described below:

|     Option    |                                                                                            Description                                                                                           |
| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|     Price     |                                                       <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders at the specified price.</div>                                                       |
|    Currency   |                <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified amount of currency away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                |
|     Ticks     |                  <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified amount of ticks away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                 |
|       %       |                    <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified percentage away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                    |
|      ATR      | <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders *N* average true ranges away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order, where *N* is a specified multiplier.</div> |
|    Forecast   |        <div align="left">(Only available for take profits orders) Use a percentile of a returned forecast to set take profits. Forecasts must be enabled in order for this to work.</div>        |
| Trailing Stop |                <div align="left">(Only available for stop loss orders) Enable a percentage based trailing stop. A position will be exited if price reach the trailing stop.</div>                |

<Note>
  The average true range used to set take profits/stop losses orders make use of a period of 200 bars.
</Note>

### Trailing Stop

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/trailing.png)

Users can use a percentage based trailing stop to exit positions. The trailing stop will move in the direction of interest if its distance with the low price(in case of long positions) or high price (in case of short positions) is greater than the specified percentage.

### Take Profits Levels From Forecast

When forecasts are displayed, users can set take profits using the **nth** percentile of a returned forecast. This can be done from the "TPS & SLS" settings, by selecting "Forecast" in the "Long TP" and/or "Short TP".

The numerical setting selected at the right of the drop-down menus determines the percentile used, and should be set within the range \[0, 100] in order to work. Percentiles values can affect the returned levels as follows:

* In case of a long trade, a lower set percentile will return take profits closer to the entry price, potentially triggering sooner.
* In case of a short trade, a lower set percentile will return take profits further away from the entry price, potentially triggering later.

<Warning>
  Do note that because forecasts are based on the strategy entries, take profits levels based on it can be subject to repainting, except when using a backtesting window based on a date.
</Warning>


# Entry Rules
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/s-o/entry



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/s-o/entry/settings.png)

Backtester (S\&O) makes use of various features within the Signals & Overlays® toolkit such as [Confirmation and Contrarian Signals](/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/signals) or [Overlays indicators](/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/indicator-overlay) to specify entry rules for the strategy.

<Tip>
  More information regarding signal settings can be found [here](/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/signal-settings)
</Tip>

By default, backtesting is performed using the most recent 2000 bars, this value can be changed from the **Backtest Window (Bars)** setting, the user can also perform a backtest between two specified dates using the "Date" options in "Backtesting Window", or using all the available chart history by using "Entire History" (note that this will not allow the optimizer to run).

## Long/Short Entry Conditions

Users can specify their strategy respective long/short entry rules from the **LONG CONDITIONS** and **SHORT CONDITIONS** settings sections, using the following available options:

|       Condition      |                                                                                                   Options                                                                                                   |                                                                                                            Options (2)                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Multiple conditions can be enabled at the same time, in which case the backtester will require all conditions to be true in order to execute an order.

<Note>
  If the **Exit On Signal** setting is enabled, existing positions will be exited on the occurrence of a confirmation/contrarian signal if enabled.
</Note>

## No Existing Positions Requirement

Users can enable the **Don't Allow Trades Until Closed** setting in order to only open trade when no existing positions are open. This setting allows waiting for a position to be closed before one can be opened.

<Note>
  Enabling **Don't Allow Trades Until Closed** for long positions will prevent opening shorts as long as a long position is opened.

  If this same setting is not enabled for short conditions then shorts can effectively be closed by new long positions.

Users can close any position on a profit or loss using specific crossing conditions obtained from a user-selected external source and/or by using our builtins exits. Exit conditions can be enabled in the **EXIT CONDITIONS** settings section.

## External Exits

### Exit Take Profit

Long/Short take profits exit conditions will exit a long or short position when a set condition is met such that the position exits on a profit.

Take profits conditions are triggered if they are toggled on for a specific order (Long/Short) and if the selected external source is either **Crossing**, **Crossing Up**, or **Crossing Down**, **Greater Than**, **Lower Than**, or **Equal** to the numerical value specified by the user.

### Exit Stop Losses

Long/Short stop-losses exit conditions will exit a long or short order when a set condition is met such that the position exits on a loss.

Stop losses conditions are triggered if they are toggled on for a specific order (Long/Short) and if the selected external source is either **Crossing**, **Crossing Up**, or **Crossing Down**, **Greater Than**, **Lower Than**, or **Equal** to the numerical value specified by the user.

### Placeholders

![Exit Long Take Profit when closing price cross the upper Bollinger band extremity](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/s-o/exits/placeholder.png)

Users who do not wish to use a numerical value to evaluate a condition with an external source may use a placeholder instead, which allows price data to be used. The following placeholders are supported:

* `open` : Opening price
* `high` : High price
* `low` : Low price
* `close` : Closing price
* `hl2` : <Tooltip tip="(high + low) / 2"> Median price </Tooltip>
* `ohlc4` : <Tooltip tip="(open + high + low + close) / 4"> Average price </Tooltip>
* `hlc3` : <Tooltip tip="(high + low + close) / 3"> Typical price </Tooltip>
* `hlcc4` : <Tooltip tip="(high + low + 2 * close) / 4"> Weighted price </Tooltip>

## Builtins Exits

Built-in exits are included for the selected signal algorithm, these are the same as the ones present in the Signals & Overlays® toolkit and can be used in the Backtester to exit positions.

<Note>
  Built-in exits will always exit a position on a profit.
</Note>

## Time Exits

Time exits allow users to exit trade at a specific time of the day. Note that trades are still exited at the opening of the next bar.

<Note>
  The timezone is the same as the one on the chart symbol.
</Note>

## Exit On Signal

Enabling the **Exit On Signal** setting will close any position once a new confirmation or contrarian signal is generated (if enabled).

## Partial Exits

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/partial.png)

Users can exit a percentage of an existing position by specifying a percentage lower than 100%.

This can lead to sequential exits, with reduced exposure each time an exit is triggered.

Backtester (S\&O) is a script that allows users to perform backtests using features from our [Signals & Overlays®](/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/introduction) toolkit. Many options are included to provide more complete & diverse backtests to the user, and each core component of the system are described in the following pages:

These should be adjusted to return more precise and accurate results of the real performance of a trading strategy.

<Warning>
  Backtests are not indicative of future results. Backtesting strategies on synthetic data does not return representative results of a strategy. Backtests should be performed on charts returning real closing prices.

  *CFTC Rule 4.41 - Hypothetical or Simulated performance results have certain limitations, unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight.

# Optimization
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/s-o/optimization



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/s-o/optimization/optimization.png)

When signals are used to perform a backtest, the Backtester is able to return the **Sensitivity** setting that maximized a user specified statistic such as net profit, winrate, profit factor, or maximum drawdown.

<Note>
  Certain settings will disable the optimization procedure, such as disabling the backtesting window or using autopilot.
</Note>

## Procedure

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/s-o/optimization/settings.png)

Users can choose to optimize net profit, winrate, profit factor, potential ratio $(\varphi)$ or maximum drawdown depending on the options selected from the **Optimize** drop-down menu within the **OPTIMIZER** settings section.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Net Profit">
    The overall profit or loss achieved (higher is better).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Winrate">
    The percentage of winning trades (higher is better).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Profit Factor">
    The gross profits over gross losses generated by the strategy (higher is better). A value higher than 1 suggest that the strategy generated more profits than losses.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Maximum Drawdown">
    The greatest decline of the strategy relative to the highest net profits (Lower is better).

    A lower value is indicative of a strategy less subject to large downside variability.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Potential Ratio (φ)">
    The ratio between the sum of maximum potential profits you could have made in your trades over the sum of maximum potential losses you could have made in your trades (higher is better).

    Higher values indicates that the entries generated by the strategy have the potential to lead to larger profits compared to losses. Lower values however might be indicative of a more risky strategy, with more frequent exposure to larger potential losses.

    If the backtest with the highest potential ratio is not the one with the highest potential profit then it can be indicative of a strategy with more potential with a tendency to exit trades potentially too late.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Optimization can be performed on any given range for the **Sensitivity** setting.

<Warning>
  Optimizing the **Sensitivity** setting using a large range of values and/or using a large backtest window can increase computation time, potentially returning time-out errors.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Results from the optimizer can vary from the backtest results returned by the strategy, this is due to the difference between how the Tradingview backtesting engine opens positions compared to the internal engine used to perform optimization within the script. Using different signal algorithms for long/short entry rules can return very different results from the optimizer compared to backtesting results.

  Take profits and/or stop losses orders are taken into account by the internal engine if these are enabled, however, there can still exist a great degree of disparity between results from the backtest and results returned by the optimizer.
</Note>

### Warmup Period

The warmup period allows the script to compute the signal algorithms *n* bars prior to the backtesting window, where *n* is the selected warmup period. This allows to backtest signals that are closer to the ones returned by the Signals & Overlays® toolkit, returning more accurate optimized settings as a result.

## Optimization Dashboard

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/s-o/optimization/dashboard.png)

Users can see the backtests results for sensitivity values within the specified optimization range on a dashboard shown on the top-right of their chart. This dashboard presents results in descending order, with results associated to the best optimized statistic appearing on top.

### Simple

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/s-o/optimization/simple.png)

Users that do not wish to have a large dashboard on the chart can use the **Simple** optimization dashboard. This dashboard will only return the **Sensitivity** setting that optimize the selected statistic alongside the statistic of interest.

### Display

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/s-o/optimization/display.png)

Users can control the location as well as hide the optimization dashboard on the chart from the **DISPLAY** settings section.

A dashboard location set to **None** will hide it from the chart as well as disable the optimizer.


# Take Profit & Stop Loss
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/backtesters/s-o/tpsl



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/tpsl.png)

Users can set take profits and stop losses orders allowing a certain degree of money management in the backtest. Take profits and stop loss orders can be enabled and adjusted from the **FIXED TPS & SLS** settings section.

<Note>
  Take profits and stop losses orders are placed relative to the price preceding a trade, and might not be filled at the exact price set by the user.
</Note>

## TP/SL Options

Take profits and stop losses for specific orders can be enabled from the toggles in their settings section. Take profits and stop losses can be set using various methods described below:

|     Option    |                                                                                            Description                                                                                           |
| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|     Price     |                                                       <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders at the specified price.</div>                                                       |
|    Currency   |                <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified amount of currency away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                |
|     Ticks     |                  <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified amount of ticks away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                 |
|       %       |                    <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders a specified percentage away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order.</div>                    |
|      ATR      | <div align="left">Set the take profit/stop loss orders *N* average true ranges away from the closing price preceding the entry of a long/short order, where *N* is a specified multiplier.</div> |
|    Forecast   |        <div align="left">(Only available for take profits orders) Use a percentile of a returned forecast to set take profits. Forecasts must be enabled in order for this to work.</div>        |
| Trailing Stop |             <div align="left">(Only available for stop loss orders) Enable a percentage-based trailing stop. A position will be exited if the price reaches the trailing stop.</div>             |

<Note>
  The average true range used to set take profits/stop losses orders uses a period of 200 bars.
</Note>

### Trailing Stop

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/backtesters/trailing.png)

Users can use a percentage-based trailing stop to exit positions. The trailing stop will move in the direction of interest if its distance with the low price (in case of long positions) or high price (in case of short positions) is greater than the specified percentage.

### Take Profits Levels From Forecast

When forecasts are displayed, users can set take profits using the **nth** percentile of a returned forecast. This can be done from the "TPS & SLS" settings, by selecting "Forecast" in the "Long TP" and/or "Short TP".

The numerical setting selected at the right of the drop-down menus determines the percentile used, and should be set within the range \[0, 100] in order to work. Percentiles values can affect the returned levels as follows:

* In case of a long trade, a lower set percentile will return take profits closer to the entry price, potentially triggering sooner.
* In case of a short trade, a lower set percentile will return take profits further away from the entry price, potentially triggering later.

<Warning>
  Do note that because forecasts are based on the strategy entries, take profits levels based on it can be subject to repainting, except when using a backtesting window based on a date.
</Warning>

## Products

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What markets & timeframes do LuxAlgo exclusive tools work on?">
    All of our exclusive tools in our core platform subscriptions function on any market available on TradingView such as stocks, crypto, forex, and commodities on all timeframes including 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4H, 1D, etc.

    The tools we provide on every plan can hypothetically fit any style of trading (scalping, swing trading, investing, etc) for finding market insights.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the accuracy of LuxAlgo signals?">
    There is no specific win rate applicable to mention regarding our signals due to the way they were designed & intended to be used as conlfuence in your analysis.

    We offer two signal modes; Confirmation (most popular) and Contrarian to help users get optimal signals for their trading style. Their intended usage is meant to form confluence within your technical analysis and they are not meant to be followed blindly. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do your indicators repaint?">
    All features within our toolkits do **not** repaint. Everything appears in real-time and are confirmed & permanent on the chart once the candle a signal was generated on has closed.

    Repainting is where past results of an indicator or a signal change based on data in the future. Various indicators have this behavior for useful purposes including only a small few of our hundreds of free indicators, not any of our paid indicators.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When is a signal confirmed?">
    Within our Signals & Overlays toolkit, any signal is confirmed only once the candle is closed. This means a signal could appear on your chart but not be confirmed until that candle is closed and the next candle has started.

    Our alerts in Discord will **never** notify you on any signal until the candle has closed and confirmed it. If you're adding alerts for our toolkits within TradingView, make sure to always select the "Once per bar close" configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to pay for TradingView to use LuxAlgo?">
    You don't need to upgrade your TradingView account, our exclusive tools work with 100% functionality on the basic plan of TradingView (free). [You can sign up for free here](https://www.tradingview.com/gopro/?share_your_love=LuxAlgo).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are LuxAlgo paid plans friendly for beginners?">
    Yes, all of our plans are great for beginners.

    Every plan comes with many tutorials as well as access to our highly active community where users can get 24/7 support, discuss strategies, & go through daily analysis amongst each other using LuxAlgo.

    Our Ultimate Plan is great for data-driven traders who want to do more advanced backtesting but even a beginner can maximize their advantage of it using our AI platform.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I automate my trades with LuxAlgo?">
    We designed our exclusive tools as a comprehensive suite to use to for discretionary analysis, however, you could hypothetically use third-party platforms to create automated strategies via webhooks to automate trades. We do not provide resources directly for this as we believe & promote indicators are best used as supportive tools for decison making.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use LuxAlgo on MetaTrader (MT4 or MT5)?">
    Our core subscription plans with our exclusive tools work only on TradingView (free web-based charting platform) and you can trade on any platform in real-time based on those charts.

    We do offer free tools for MetaTrader 4/5 via the LuxAlgo Library, however, our exclusive tools specifically work on TradingView.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see every indicator in real-time data?">
    Yes, TradingView supports real-time data for the majority of tickers you can find on the platform. Only a small portion of them (mostly futures contracts) require a small monthly fee to access real-time data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are the paid tools better than the free LuxAlgo indicators?">
    Just as much as we pride ourselves as the world's largest provider of trading indicators, we pride ourselves as having the most innovative trading products in the world.

    Our exclusive tools have deeper customization and were solely designed from years of user-feedback to give the most professional workflows possible to help you as a trader.

    Price action traders who like to keep things simple benefit from our Essential plan, strong technical traders love our Premium plan for all of our toolkits + screeners, and the data-driven traders seek our Ultimate plan for our advanced backtesting capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I getting 'Study_not_auth' error?">
    This error message appears when an user does not have access to the indicator. If you've already registered your TradingView username within our Connect Accounts portal and you're seeing this message, refresh your browser or app and make sure you're logged in on the TradingView profile you entered.

    If you are still getting this issue, let our live human support team know your TradingView username and we will fix your access. If you're speaking to an AI Agent, request to speak to a human directly. If you have not signed up with us, you'll see this error when trying to add our exclusive tools to your chart. You can get instant access [here](https://luxalgo.com/pricing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I getting 'Internal Server Study' error?">
    This error generally occurs when TradingView can't handle script loads under high traffic. This error can appear when a high number of features are enabled. Changing settings within the indicators, or hiding/unhiding it will make the script recalculate and potentially fix the issue.

    We are always trying to improve the performance of the toolkit in order to limit these issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I getting 'Memory limits exceeded. The study allocates X times more than allowed' error?">
    This error generally occurs when a TradingView study exceeds the memory limit fixed by TradingView. This error can't be directly prevented and will generally be returned when using anything below the 1 minute timeframe.

    We recommend users to stay with minute and higher timeframes to avoid potential errors with our premium toolkits.

# TradingView Alerts
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/getting-started/tradingview-alerts



In this page, we show you the specifics of how to set up any alert on TradingView in general. If you want to learn how to set up specific alerts on our exclusive tools specifically, you can see the following [video](https://youtu.be/olKQq5XR5S0?t=38).

On the TradingView platform, alerts can be created to trigger for any user set condition, such as crosses between two indicators, price entering or exiting a channel...etc. Users can be notified when the condition is trigerred via phone notifications, emails, SMS, and more through webhooks.

## How To Create An Alert

To create an alert you can:

* Click on the alert button at the top of your chart.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/image510.png)

* From the alert manager

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/image370.png)

* Using hotkeys `ALT + A` (Windows) or `⌥ + A` (Mac)

## Trigger Conditions

Users can select the conditions used to trigger an alert in the condition menu, selecting the indicators and a set of rules used to trigger an alert. The second drop down menu controls the specific alert trigger conditions, while the other drop down controls the elements/plots to be used for conditions.

<Note>
  Indicators return plots, which are visual elements that can be used to set the alert condition. Plots are used to visualize series of values, conditions, etc. Note that indicators can return multiple plots.
</Note>

Available conditions to set custom alerts are explained below:

### Crossing/Crossing Up/Crossing Down

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/crossing_conditions.png)

Crossing conditions are commonly used and allow users to be alerted when two elements cross each other.

Three crossing conditions are available, **Crossing**, **Crossing Up**, **Crossing Down**.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/crossing.png)

**Crossing** will alert on any crosses between two selected plots/values.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/crossingUp.png)

**Crossing Up** will alert only when the first selected element crosses over the second one.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/crossingDown.png)

**Crossing Down** will alert only when the first selected element crosses over the second one.

### Entering/Exiting Channel

**Entering/Exiting Channels** conditions will trigger when any selected element enter or exit user selected upper/lower bounds.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/enteringChannel.png)

The **Entering Channel** condition will trigger when the element in the first drop-down menu cross-under the selected upper bound or cross-over the selected lower bound.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/exitingChannel.png)

The **Exiting Channel** condition will trigger when the element in the first drop-down menu cross-over the selected upper bound or cross-under the selected lower bound.

### Outside/Inside Channel

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/outsideChannel.png)

**Outside/Inside Channels** conditions will trigger when any selected element is outside or within selected upper/lower bounds.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/insideChannel.png)

### Greater/Less Than

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/greaterThan.png)

The **Greater Than** and **Less Than** conditions will trigger when a selected element is greater or less than a selected element or value.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/lessThan.png)

## How To Use Placeholders

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/image257.png)

Placeholders allow for the value of a variable to be returned in an alert message. This variable can be the closing price of a symbol (`{{close}}`), the time frame of the chart the alert is created on (`{{interval}}`), and even the value of an indicator. This is done using the `{{plot("Name")}}` placeholder, where `"Name"` is the name of the plot you want the value to be returned in the alert message. Note that only the first 22 plots in an indicator can be used in placeholders.

<Note>
  Note that `plot("Name")` must be part of the indicator selected in the alert condition.
</Note>

## Warning Message

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/image276.png)

When you create an alert using certain indicators such as the Signals & Overlays® indicator, you might see a warning message, this is caused by internal Pinescript functions used in the script that may have a repainting behavior when set in a specific way.

The alerts provided by the LuxAlgo indicators **do not repaint** and as such, you can click on **continue anyway**.

## Managing Alerts

The alerts manager menu allows you to manage the alerts you have currently set. From there you can create, remove, pause, reactivate, clone, search, sort and edit your alerts. To access the alert manager menu click on the alerts icon represented by an alarm symbol at the top left of the chart.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/image370.png)

If you want to remove all your current alerts click on the three horizontal dots at the right of the "add alert" icon, then select "remove all".

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/image476.png)

For more information on how to manage alerts go [here](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000595311-manage-alerts/).

### Updating Alerts

It is important to note that if one of the indicator settings is **changed after the alert is created**, then the alert will be **triggered using the old settings**. In order to update an alert go to the alert manager and click on edit.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/image.png)

In the first drop-down menu of the **Condition** section, select the second indicator with the same name as the one first used to create the alert you want to update and save the alert.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/setup-alerts/image515.png)

Traders typically have several questions after seeing LuxAlgo, one of them being:

> *What advantages do these paid tools give me over free ones?*

And the most important one:

> *Will I make profits using them?*

It would be presumptuous and dishonest on our part to tell you the tools we provide will guarantee you huge returns in a short amount of time, markets are more complicated than that.

No indicator is capable of guaranteeing an improvement to your performance by itself, nor is any strategy capable of maintaining a percentage accuracy over time; money printers do not exist. Our tools are designed to generate easily understandable workflows & strategies for your analysis and we actively update the tools over time which is what actually can make them useful for you in your trading journey.

## The User And An Indicator

A trader may expect an indicator to work by itself without requiring any user interaction; just set alerts, trade automatically, and make profits. "If an indicator can't generate returns under these conditions then it isn't worth using."

The worth of any technical trading tool will hardly be found in its ability to make you money by itself, the complexity of markets makes this far too difficult. A technical indicator is not smart enough, nor adaptable enough to overcome such extreme complexities, however, this is not the case of the experienced trader, who will not use an indicator as a money printer, but as a supportive tool for decision making.

We believe that the success lies in the association of the *user* and the *indicator.*

An indicator plugged into charting software can access and process large amounts of data, delivering a large quantity of useful and easy to interpret visual information which the trader can't really do by themselves, but he/she is smart, aware of a lot of external factors, and can manage their money.

A suite of tools that give non-redundant information and that is easy to customize and use for alerts & strategy optimization throughout any trader's journey will create a strong pairing; and this is what we aim to provide at LuxAlgo with our exclusive tools.

## Embracing Your Trading Style

If you are not free you won't go far, some traders find themselves as natural contrarians going against the trend, others ride with the trend, however, whatever your trading style is -- LuxAlgo embraces it.

Each element can be disabled/enabled from the screener settings.

## Ratings

The screener ratings indicate the confluence of all returned screener data for each individual ticker by measuring the percentage of bullish indications returned by the enabled screener elements. Ratings are determined as follows:

* ▲ Strong Bullish (more than 80% of the returned information is bullish)
* △ Bullish (60% to 80% of the returned information is bullish)
* ― Neutral (40% to 60% of the returned information is bullish)
* ▽ Bearish (20% to 60% of the returned information is bullish)
* ▼ Strong Bearish (less than 20% of the returned information is bullish)

## Indicator Settings

Users can control the settings of the included indicators in the screener from their respective settings group, these include:

#### Smart Money Flow

* Main Length
* Smooth

#### HyperWave

* Main Length
* Signal & Signal Length
* Divergence Sensitivity

#### Reversals

* Reversal Factor

## Colors

Users are able to change the color of the information returned by each element from the "Screener Elements" settings.


# Filtering

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/screeners/osc/filtering/filter.png" />
</Frame>

From the "Screener Elements" settings users are able to filter out undesired information returned by the screener. This is done from the dropdown setting located on each "Screener Elements" settings.

Certain elements returning specific information from a list of supported options will have a filter allowing to select a precise option, while elements returning a value on the screener will make use of conditional operators (Above/Below).

Users can set a filtering condition on multiple elements, allowing them to display the tickers that respect the user set filtering conditions.


# Introduction

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/screeners/osc/introduction/screener.png)

The Screener (OSC) is a useful tool able to return recent information from various features in the **Oscillator Matrix®** toolkit for up to 10 user set tickers with customizable timeframe.

In order to use the screener the best way possible it is first advised to fully understand the [Oscillator Matrix®](/docs/toolkits/oscillator-matrix/introduction) toolkit.

Provided below are pages describing all key features included.

  <Card title="Sorting" icon="arrow-up-wide-short" href="/screeners/osc/sorting" />
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  Having access to the **Oscillator Matrix®** will automatically grant you access to the OSC screener.
</Info>

## Tickers

Users can change tickers as well as their respective timeframes from the screener settings. Default tickers include:

* BTCUSDT
* ETHUSDT
* SOLUSDT
* ADAUSDT
* SPX
* AAPL
* TSLA
* NVDA
* EURUSD
* GBPUSD

The default timeframe used for all is the user chart timeframe. Supported tickers includes all tickers available on Tradingview (note that this availability can be affected by your Tradingview plan).

Users can also use the same ticker but different timeframes, allowing to perform multi timeframe analysis of the **Oscillator Matrix®** toolkit. However, duplicated tickers with the same timeframe will result in the duplicate ticker to not appear on the screener.

## Display

Users are offered a high degree of freedom when it comes to the placement of the screener. By default, the screener is located on a different pane, with the options to select the following positions:

* Top Center
* Top Right
* Top Left
* Bottom Center
* Bottom Right
* Bottom Left

It is also common for more compact screeners to be directly on the price chart, this is possible with this screener by drag and dropping it to the user chart, or by moving it to the existing pane above assuming the screener is in a pane below the price chart.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/screeners/pane.png)

## Notes

Tradingview is not a friendly environment when it comes to running more complete screeners, this cause various limitations showcased below:

### Computation

The computation of a screener on Tradingview is very intensive, as such you can expect rare calculations timeouts. When this occurs simply force the screener recalculation by modifying one setting or adding the screener again to your chart.

### Inconsistency

It is possible to observe inconsistencies when observing the screener on a chart with a specific symbol due to screener tickers having being on different market.

The crypto market operates 24/7 while stock markets have opening and closing times, this can cause the screener to return different information when observing it from a cryptocurrency or stock/currency pair.


# Sorting
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/screeners/osc/sorting



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/screeners/sort.png)

Users can sort certain elements returning/or with an associated numerical information in either a descending or ascending order. This can be useful to see specific tickers first or last depending on the sorted data on the screener.

Supported elements for sorting include:

* Rating
* Money Flow
* HyperWave
* None

<Note>When "None" is selected the screener tickers appear as per their order in the Tickers settings.</Note>

Each element can be disabled/enabled from the screener settings.

## Ratings

The screener ratings indicate the confluence of all returned screener data for each individual ticker by measuring the percentage of bullish indications returned by the enabled screener elements. Ratings are determined as follows:

* ▲ Strong Bullish (more than 80% of the returned information is bullish)
* △ Bullish (60% to 80% of the returned information is bullish)
* ― Neutral (40% to 60% of the returned information is bullish)
* ▽ Bearish (20% to 60% of the returned information is bullish)
* ▼ Strong Bearish (less than 20% of the returned information is bullish)

## Signal Settings

The most recent signal returned by the screener is affected by the "Signal" settings group. These settings allow changing the sensitivity of the signals as well as the signal algorithm, with users having the option to select Confirmation or Contrarian signals.

## Overlays Settings

Overlay indicators screener elements are affected by their respective settings located in the "Overlays" settings group.

Each overlay has an associated setting affecting their output. These settings range from 1 to 5, with higher values allowing the overlay to return indications for longer-term trends.

## Colors

Users are able to change the color of the information returned by each element from the "Screener Elements" settings.


# Filtering
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/screeners/s-o/filtering



<Frame caption="S&O Screener with △ Bullish Rating filter enabled">
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/screeners/s-o/filtering/filter.png" />
</Frame>

From the "Screener Elements" settings users are able to filter out undesired information returned by the screener. This is done from the dropdown setting located on each "Screener Elements" settings.

Certain elements returning specific information from a list of supported options will have a filter allowing to select a precise option, while elements returning a value on the screener will make use of conditional operators (Above/Below), except the Lux Volatility.

Users can set a filtering condition on multiple elements, allowing them to display the tickers that respect the user set filtering conditions.


# Introduction
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/screeners/s-o/introduction



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/screeners/s-o/introduction/screener.png)

The Screener (S\&O) is a useful tool able to return recent information from various features in the **Signals & Overlays®** toolkit for up to 10 user set tickers with customizable timeframe.

In order to use the screener the best way possible it is first advised to fully understand the [Signals & Overlays®](/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/introduction) toolkit.

Provided below are pages describing all key features included.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Elements" icon="puzzle-piece" href="/screeners/s-o/elements" />

  <Card title="Filtering" icon="filter" href="/screeners/s-o/filtering" />

  <Card title="Sorting" icon="arrow-up-wide-short" href="/screeners/s-o/sorting" />
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  Having access to the **Signals & Overlays®** will automatically grant you access to the S\&O screener.
</Info>

## Tickers

Users can change tickers as well as their respective timeframes from the screener settings. Default tickers include:

* BTCUSDT
* ETHUSDT
* SOLUSDT
* ADAUSDT
* SPX
* AAPL
* TSLA
* NVDA
* EURUSD
* GBPUSD

The default timeframe used for all is the user chart timeframe. Supported tickers includes all tickers available on Tradingview (note that this availability can be affected by your Tradingview plan).

Users can also use the same ticker but different timeframes, allowing to perform multi timeframe analysis of the **Signals & Overlays®** toolkit. However, duplicated tickers with the same timeframe will result in the duplicate ticker to not appear on the screener.

## Display

Users are offered a high degree of freedom when it comes to the placement of the screener. By default, the screener is located on a different pane, with the options to select the following positions:

* Top Center
* Top Right
* Top Left
* Bottom Center
* Bottom Right
* Bottom Left

It is also common for more compact screeners to be directly on the price chart, this is possible with this screener by drag and dropping it to the user chart, or by moving it to the existing pane above assuming the screener is in a pane below the price chart.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/screeners/pane.png)

## Notes

Tradingview is not a friendly environment when it comes to running more complete screeners, this cause various limitations showcased below:

### Computation

The computation of a screener on Tradingview is very intensive, as such you can expect rare calculations timeouts. When this occurs simply force the screener recalculation by modifying one setting or adding the screener again to your chart.

### Inconsistency

It is possible to observe inconsistencies when observing the screener on a chart with a specific symbol due to screener tickers having being on different market.

The crypto market operates 24/7 while stock markets have opening and closing times, this can cause the screener to return different information when observing it from a cryptocurrency or stock/currency pair.


# Sorting
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/screeners/s-o/sorting



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/screeners/sort.png)

Users can sort certain elements returning/or with an associated numerical information in either a descending or ascending order. This can be useful to see specific tickers first or last depending on the sorted data on the screener.

Supported elements for sorting include:

* Rating
* Trend Strength
* Lux Volatility
* Squeeze Index
* Volume Sentiment
* Exits
* None

<Note>When "None" is selected the screener tickers appear as per their order in the Tickers settings.</Note>

# Actions
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/alert-scripting/actions



Actions are elements tied to a user set condition producing a specific effect when the assigned condition is true. These allow users to have more control over their scripted alert, from invalidating sequences, to plotting graphical elements on the chart.

<Info>
  Actions always have the structure `@keyword() = ...`, starting with `@`, with an identifier, and `()`.

  `=` will assign to the action a condition. When the assigned condition is true the action will trigger.
</Info>

Like functions in classical programing languages, actions can have arguments located within `()`, adding further degrees of control over the action.

<Info>
  All actions arguments are optional.
</Info>

This page lists out the available actions syntax as well as their utility.

## @alert

The `@alert` action allows users to get alerted when the associated condition is true.

```js
@alert(message)
```

### Arguments

**message** (string): Alert message. Default is the associated condition.

### Examples

```js
// Send an alert when close > open
@alert(close is greater than open) = {close} > {open}
```

## @label

The `@label` action allows users to draw labels on the toolkit pane when the associated condition is true.

### Syntax

```js
@label(y, text, text_color, color, style, size)
```

### Arguments

**y** (placeholder): y coordinate value of the label. Accepts data placeholders as values. Default is `"{close}"`.

**text** (string): text displayed on the label. Default text is the condition.

<Info>
  Placeholders can be used within the text, these will be replaced with the corresponding value. For example:

  ```
  @label(text="closing price: {close}")
  ```
</Info>

**color** (color): color of the label. Possible values include:

```
"black", "silver", "gray", "white", "maroon", "purple", "fuchsia", "green", "red", "lime", "olive", "yellow", "navy", "blue", "teal", "aqua", "orange"
```

Default is the opposite color to the chart background.

**text\_color** (color): color of the text displayed on the label. Possible values include:

```
"black", "silver", "gray", "white", "maroon", "purple", "fuchsia", "green", "red", "lime", "olive", "yellow", "navy", "blue", "teal", "aqua", "orange"
```

Default is the chart background color.

**style** (string): Shape of the displayed label, possible values include:

* `"none"`
* `"xcross"`
* `"cross"`
* `"triangleup"`
* `"triangledown"`
* `"flag"`
* `"circle"`
* `"arrowup"`
* `"arrowdown"`
* `"label_up"`
* `"label_down"`
* `"label_left"`
* `"label_right"`
* `"label_lower_left"`
* `"label_lower_right"`
* `"label_upper_left"`
* `"label_upper_right"`
* `"label_center"`
* `"square"`
* `"diamond"`

Default is `"label_down"`

### Examples

```js
// Draw a label when close > open
@label(y="{close}", text="Up", color="green", text_color="white", style="label_up", size="small") = {close} > {open}
```

### Remarks

Currently, the value in `y` does not fully support historical referencing.

## @line

The `@line` action allows users to draw lines on the toolkit pane when the associated condition is true.

### Syntax

```js
@line(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)
```

### Arguments

**x1** (integer): How far ahead from the current bar the x1 coordinate of the line is located. Accepts negative values. Default is `"0"`.

**y1** (placeholder): y1 coordinate value of the line. Accepts data placeholders as values. Default is `"{close}"` except for the Oscillator Matrix® which uses 50.

**x2** (integer): How far ahead from the current bar the x2 coordinate of the line is located. Accepts negative values. Default is `"0"`.

**y2** (placeholder): y2 coordinate value of the line. Accepts data placeholders as values. Default is `"{close}"` except for the Oscillator Matrix® which uses 50.

**color** (color): color of the label. Possible values include:

```
"black", "silver", "gray", "white", "maroon", "purple", "fuchsia", "green", "red", "lime", "olive", "yellow", "navy", "blue", "teal", "aqua", "orange"

Default is `"blue"`.

### Examples

```js
// Draw line if closing price cross over closing price 10 bars ago
@line(x1="-10", y1="{low}", x2="10", y2="{high}", color="green") = {close} crossover {close[10]}
```

### Remarks

Currently, values of `y1`/`y2` do not fully support historical referencing.

## @valuewhen

Plot a user set value on the chart when the assigned condition is true.

### Syntax

```js
@valuewhen(source)
```

### Arguments

**source** (placeholder): value to plot when the assigned condition is true, only supports placeholders. Default is `{close}` except for the Oscillator Matrix® which uses 50.

### Examples

```js
//Plot {high} when close crossover open
@valuewhen({high}) = {close} crossover {open}
```

### Remarks

The plot for `@valuewhen` is accessible as input for other scripts with name "@Valuewhen", also allowing users to create alerts using it.

## @invalidate

Invalidate a sequence of condition when the assigned condition is `True`.

### Syntax

```js
@invalidate(step)
```

### Arguments

**step** (integer, integer list): step to consider for invalidation, supports multiple values. If no steps are provided all steps will be evaluated.

### Examples

```js
// Alert when sequence is completed:
// step 1: closing price is above opening price
// step 2: closing price is above previous high

{close} > {open}
{close} > {high[1]}

// Invalidate sequence if opening price is lower than previous low
@invalidate() = {open} < {low[1]}
```

Example evaluating our invalidation condition on a specific step:

```js
// Alert when sequence is completed:
// step 1: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 500
// step 2: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 1000
// step 3: closing price is under opening price

{close} > {open} and {volume} > 500
{close} > {open} and {volume} > 1000
{close} < {open}

// Invalidate sequence if closing price is lower than opening price
// when we are evaluating the second step (step=1)
@invalidate(step=1) = {close} < {open}
```

Example evaluating our invalidation condition on multiple step:

```js
// Alert when sequence is completed:
// step 1: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 500
// step 2: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 1000
// step 3: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 1500
// step 4: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 2000
// step 5: closing price is under opening price

{close} > {open} and {volume} > 500
{close} > {open} and {volume} > 1000
{close} > {open} and {volume} > 1500
{close} > {open} and {volume} > 2000
{close} < {open}

// Invalidate sequence if closing price is lower than opening price
// when we are evaluating the second, third, and fourth step (step=1,2,3)
@invalidate(step=1,2,3) = {close} < {open}
```

## @filter

Use the assigned condition as filtering condition for all or user defined steps.

### Syntax

```js
@filter(step)
```

### Arguments

**step** (integer, integer list): step where the filtering condition is applied, supports multiple values. If no steps are provided all steps will have the filtering condition applied.

### Examples

```js
// Alert when sequence is completed:
// step 1: closing price is above opening price and volume > 500
// step 2: closing price is above previous high and volume > 500

{close} > {open}
{close} > {high[1]}

// Apply our previously defined volume > 500 filter
@filter() = {volume} > 500
```

Example providing different filters across steps:

```js
// Alert when sequence is completed:
// step 1: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 1000
// step 2: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 1000
// step 3: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 2000
// step 4: closing price is above opening price and volume is above 2000
// step 5: closing price is under opening price

{close} > {open}
{close} > {open}
{close} > {open}
{close} > {open}
{close} < {open}

// Apply our previously defined volume > 1000 filter to step 1 and 2
@filter(step=0,1) = {volume} > 1000

// Apply our previously defined volume > 2000 filter to step 3 and 4
@filter(step=2,3) = {volume} > 2000
```

## @set\_step

Set the sequence step to a user defined value, or increase/decrease the current set by a user set increment/decrement.

### Syntax

```js
@set_step(value)
```

### Arguments

**value** (integer): New value of the step. Users can also increase the current step value using `+` as prefix, e.g: `+1`, or decrease it using `-` as prefix, e.g: `-1`.

### Example

```js
// Define UDPs
{bull} = {close} > {open}
{bear} = {close} < {open}
{bull+} = {close} > {high[1]} and {bull}
{bear+} = {close} < {low[1]} and {bear}

// Define sequence
{bull} // Step 1
{bear} // Step 2
{bull+} // Step 3
{bear+} // Step 4

// Reset sequence to corresponding step
@set_value(0) = {bull} // Reset to step 1
@set_value(1) = {bear} // Reset to step 2
@set_value(2) = {bull+} // Reset to step 3
```

### Remarks

Users cannot set a negative value for a step (e.g: `@set_step(-1)`), which would instead set the step to 0, however, the step can become negative when using increments/decrements.

Alert Scripting is a feature within each of our 3 exclusive toolkits that allows users to create extremely advanced alert conditions using our own scripting language. Alert Scripting is available towards the bottom of the settings of each LuxAlgo toolkit and mostly all features are usable for creating alert combinations.

This feature is useful for users that feel limited by the custom alert creator.

# Operators
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/alert-scripting/operators



Operators are specific tokens (characters) performing an operation over multiple defined elements. Alert scripting supports three types of operators described below.

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two numerical values with each other.

#### `>` (Greater Than)

***

`True` if value to the left of `>` is greater than the value to its right.

```js Example
{close} > {open}
```

#### `<` (Less Than)

***

`True` if value to the left of `<` is less than the value to its right.

```js Example
{close} < {open}
```

#### `>=` (Greater Than or Equal)

***

`True` if value to the left of `>=` is greater or equal to the value to its right.

```js Example
{close} >= {open}
```

#### `<=` (Less Than or Equal)

***

`True` if value to the left of `<=` is greater or equal to the value to its right.

```js Example
{close} <= {open}
```

#### `==` (Equal)

***

`True` if value to the left of `==` is equal to the value to its right.

```js Example
{close} == {open}
```

#### `!=` (Not Equal)

***

`True` if value to the left of `!=` is not equal to the value to its right.

```js Example
{close} != {open}
```

#### `crossover`

***

`True` if series to the left of `crossover` is crossing over the series to its right. Also expressed as:

* `A crossover B = A > B and A[1] < B[1]`

```js Example
{close} crossover {open}
```

<Info>
  `crossover` is not a traditional operator but serves a comparative purpose for alert scripting.
</Info>

#### `crossunder`

***

`True` if the series to the left of `crossunder` is crossing under the series to its right. Also expressed as:

* `A crossunder B = A < B and A[1] > B[1]`

```js Example
{close} crossunder {open}
```

<Info>
  `crossunder` is not a traditional operator but serves a comparative purpose for alert scripting.
</Info>

#### `cross`

***

`True` if the series to the left of `cross` is crossing (either over or under) the series to its right. Also expressed as:

* `A cross B = A crossover B or A crossunder B`
* `A cross B = (A - B) * (A[1] - B[1]) < 0`

```js Example
{close} cross {open}
```

<Info>
  `cross` is not a traditional operator but serves a comparative purpose for alert scripting.
</Info>

### Logical Operators

Logical operators link two expressions together forming a more complex condition being either `True` or `False`.

#### `and`

***

The `and` operator return true if both expressions to its side are `True`.

```js Example
{close} > {open} and {volume} > 1000
```

The above return `True` if the closing price is greater than the opening price while the volume is greater than 1000.

#### `or`

***

The `or` operator return true if either one of the expressions to its side are `True`.

```js Example
{close} > {open} or {close} > {hl2}
```

The above return `True` if the closing price is greater than the opening price or if the closing price is greater than the median price `hl2`.

It is important to note that `or` takes precedence over `and`, for example:

```js
{close} > {open} and {volume} > 1000 or {close} > {hl2} and {volume} > 1000
```

In the above condition `{close} > {open} and {volume} > 1000` and `{close} > {hl2} and {volume} > 1000` would be evaluated first.

#### `not`

The `not` operator test if a following condition is true or false, returning `True` if the condition is `False`.

```js
not {close} > {open}
```

The above return `True` if the closing price is not greater than the opening price.

### History Referencing Operator `[]`

Users can refer to previous values of a series using the historical referencing operator `[]`. This operator is placed to the right of a placeholder within the curly brackets:

```python Synthax
{A[n]}
```

Where `n` is a numerical value determining the number of bars back to go fetching `{A}`.

For example, if we want to get the previous value of the closing price we can use `{close[1]}`.

```python Example
{close} > {close[1]}
```

The above example return `True` if the current closing price is greater than value of the closing price one bar back.


# Placeholders
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/alert-scripting/placeholders



Placeholders are strings that refer to a specific series of values or events, and have the form `{placeholder_title}`, where `placeholder_title` is the name of the placeholder to access and `{}` makes sure the string is recognized as a placeholder.

Placeholders allow accessing market data such as ohlc prices, volume, but also specific features from their respective toolkit such as signals, indicators...etc.

## Common Placeholders

The placeholders below can be used in all the toolkits.

### Market Data Placeholders

Market data placeholder allows referencing typical market data such as ohlc prices and volume.

These placeholders are available for all toolkits.

These placeholders are available for all toolkits.

| Placeholder       | Description                                                                                                                                                   |

| `{hhmm-hhmm}`     | Session placeholder, `True` when the bar is located within the specific session interval, see [here](./placeholders#session-placeholder) for more information |

<Note>
  Note that `{dayofweek}` returns the day based on the time of the bar's open. For overnight sessions (e.g. EURUSD, where Monday session starts on Sunday, 17:00) this value can be lower by 1 than the day of the trading day.
</Note>

The timezone for the time related placeholders is defined by the `Timezone` dropdown setting, defining the timezone using UTC. Default value is `exchange`, which uses the exchange timezones to get the value of the time related placeholders.

#### Session Placeholder

You can easily detect if the current bar is within a specific session (time interval) by using the session placeholder with pattern `{hhmm-hhmm}`, where `hh` is the hour and `mm` the minute.

The value of this placeholder will be `True` when the bar time is located between the start time `{hhmm-` and end time `-hhmm`.

For example, if we want to detect when the bar is located in the session starting at 14:30 and ending at 16:45 we would simply use:

```python Example
{1430-1645}
```

### External Placeholders

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/alert-scripting/placeholders/external.png)

Users can refer to a series of values outside the toolkit by using external placeholder. A maximum of 5 external placeholders can be used:

* `{external1}`
* `{external2}`
* `{external3}`
* `{external4}`
* `{external5}`

In order to use external placeholders, users must first select the external source from the provided dropdowns located in the Alert Scripting settings. Once selected, external sources can be referred from their respective placeholders.

### Custom Alert Creator Placeholders

Placeholders referencing events from the custom alert creator in order to potentially create more complex alerts.

These can either be `True` or `False`.

| Placeholder           | Description                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{custom_alert_step}` | Set conditions from the custom alert creator (except OR) |
| `{custom_alert_or}`   | OR condition from the custom alert creator               |

### Sequencing Placeholders

Alert scripting includes multiple placeholders helping user create and refine a sequence of conditions.

| Placeholder        | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{step}`           | Current step in the ongoing sequence of conditions, with 0 being the first step |
| `{barssince_step}` | Numbers of bars elapsed since last step or invalidation                         |
| `{invalidated}`    | `True` is previous bar had an invalidation event                                |

The `{step}` placeholder is a special placeholder used to refer to the current step in a sequence of conditions defined in the scripted alert.

For more information, see [here](./usage#sequencing-and-using-steps).

## User Defined Placeholders (UDP)

User defined placeholders (UDPs) are custom placeholders defined by users and assigned to a specific condition set by the user. These placeholders can later be referenced as part of other conditions or UDPs.

To define a UDP a line must start with a placeholder with a unique name, followed by an equal sign `=`, then followed by the condition we want to assign to this placeholder, for example `my_placeholder} = {close} > {open}`

Let's take a more complex example and say we want to be alerted on a new bullish fair value gaps while we also had one on the previous bar.

Doing this could involve a long and messy script, to make things easier we can create an UDP that refers to the condition of a bullish fair value gaps, and reuse it for our alert condition:

```
{bull_fvg} = {low} > {high[2]} and {close[1]} > {high[2]}

{bull_fvg} and {bull_fvg[1]}
```

<Note>
  Creating an UDP will not trigger an alert from its assigned condition.

| `{itrend}`            | The trend value is determined by internal market structures, with positive values for uptrends and negative values for downtrends. In an uptrend, an Internal Change of Character (I-CHoCH) has a value of +1, while an Internal Break of Structure (I-BOS) has a value of +2. The same logic applies to downtrends but uses negative values instead (−1 for an I-CHoCH and −2 for an I-BOS). |

# Usage
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/alert-scripting/usage



Alert scripting is a good way to create more complex alerts without feeling limited by the number of conditions or their limited reusability.

This page covers the syntax of scripted alerts as well as showcasing typical use cases for alert scripting.

## Building Simple Conditions

Users can define a simple condition over a single line in the tex area "Condition Input Field".

In order to build effective conditions, we will need to reference specific data using [placeholders](./placeholders) and compare this data with each other using [operators](./operators).

For example, we could define the following condition:

```
{close} > {close[14]}
```

Here we have the following elements:

* `{close}` placeholder, referencing the current closing price value
* Greater than operator `>`, testing if the value to its left is greater than the value to its right
* `{close[14]}` refer to the value of the closing price (`{close}`) 14 bars ago (defined by the historical referencing operator `[14]`)

This simple condition is `True` if the current closing price is higher than the closing price 14 bars ago.

### Combining Conditions

Creating slightly more complex conditions can involve combining individual ones into a single one, allowing us to retain more precise events or on the contrary, loosen our condition rules.

#### Combination using `and`

Using the operator `and` allows to require more than one "sub-conditions" to be valid for the whole to be true.

For example, we could reuse our previous condition but be more strict such that we only want to know when the current closing price is greater than the closing price 14 bars ago when it is between 1pm and 3pm (exchange timezone). To do this we can simply add another sub-condition leading to:

```
{close} > {close[14]} and {hour} >= 13 and {hour} <= 15
```

<Tip>
  `and` is similar to using the custom alert creator and having multiple enabled conditions using the same step number.
</Tip>

Another example where we can combine multiple conditions is to detect FVG's, for the case of a bullish FVG we have the following requirements:

* current low price is higher than the high price two bars ago
* previous closing price is higher than the high price two bars ago

We can use alert scripting to detect bullish FVG's from this combination of conditions as follows:

```
{low} > {high[2]} and {close[1]} > {high[2]}
```

#### Combination using `or`

Sometimes we might be interested in getting alerted about two specific different conditions, without having to create two specific alerts. This is where `or` can be useful, requiring only one of the defined sub-conditions to be true in order for the alert to trigger.

For example, we could want to be alerted either on a strong bullish confirmation signal, or when the Smart Trail turns bullish, this could be easily achieved using the following script:

```
{bullish_confirmation+} or {bullish_smart_trail} and not {bullish_smart_trail[1]}
```

Here `{bullish_confirmation+}` is true when we have a strong bullish confirmation signal.

`{bullish_smart_trail}` when the Smart Trail is bullish, with the whole `{bullish_smart_trail} and not {bullish_smart_trail[1]}` being true when the Smart Trail is currently bullish while the previous Smart trail is **not** bullish.

<Info>
  `or` takes precedence over `and`. You can think of this as a way to split a whole condition into multiple sub-conditions.

  For example if we have `{A} and {B} or {C} > 0 or {D} and {E}`, the precedence of or would split this conditions leading to `{A} and {B}`, `{C} > 0`, and `{D} and {E}`.

  Each of these individual sub-conditions would be evaluated individually, if one of them is true, then our whole condition is true.
</Info>

## Sequencing and Using Steps

Users can create sequences of conditions, triggering an alert when the last step is triggered.

Steps are made using linebreaks, with each conditions over a new line being a step. When a step is valid, the next step condition located on the line below will be evaluated at the next bar.

Once the last step is evaluated and is true, the sequence is completed which can trigger an alert (if set) and will switch to the first defined step on the next bar.

<Info>
  This is similar in practice to how the custom alert creator works.
</Info>

For example, we can define a sequence consisting of the following conditions:

* Step 1: High price is lower than the previous high price
* Step 2: Low price is lower than the previous low price
* Step 3: Closing price is lower than the opening price

Leading to the following script:

```
{high} < {high[1]}
{low} < {low[1]}
{close} < {open}
```

<Tip>
  For clarity you can assign conditions over a single line to a variable defined at the start.

  ```
  condition1 = ...
  condition2 = ...
  condition3 = ...
  ```

  Do note that the variable cannot be referenced.
</Tip>

### Invalidation

Invalidation refers to going back to evaluating the first step of a sequence of conditions when one or more specific conditions are true.

<Note>
  Invalidation takes place prior to evaluating steps.
</Note>

Invalidation conditions can be defined using the [`@invalidate`]("./actions") action:

```
@invalidate() = ...
```

If the condition assigned to the `@invalidate` action is true, we will go back to evaluating the sequence of conditions to step 1.

<Tip>
  multiple invalidation conditions can be defined separately for clarity:

  ```
  @invalidate() = ...
  @invalidate() = ...
  @invalidate() = ...
  ```
</Tip>

#### Step Specific Invalidation

It is possible to apply invalidation conditions to specific steps, this is done using the `step` parameter in the `@invalidate` action.

To illustrate this, we can reuse our previous sequence of conditions:

```
{high} < {high[1]}
{low} < {low[1]}
{close} < {open}
```

Maybe that we don't want the closing price to be greater than the opening price as long as the second step is the one being evaluated, this can be achieved by simply as follows:

```
{high} < {high[1]}
{low} < {low[1]}
{close} < {open}

invalidate(step=1) = {close} > {open}
```

Here `step=1` refer to the second step needing to be the one being evaluated in the sequence to apply the invalidation condition `{close} > {open}`.

<Info>
  With steps, 0 refers to the first step because it is 0 indexed.
</Info>

#### Invalidate on Step Evaluation Duration

Sometimes we might not want to keep evaluating one or multiple steps for an excessive number of bars, and instead prefer having each step being triggered with a short interval in between.

This can easily be done using invalidation and the placeholder `barssince_step`, which quantify the number of bars that elapsed since a step has started being evaluated or since invalidation took place.

For example, we can invalidate a sequence of conditions if the amount elapsed since a step is greater than 5 bars:

```
{high} < {high[1]}
{low} < {low[1]}
{close} < {open}

@invalidate() = {barssince_step} > 5
```

### Global Filters

It is possible to define a single global condition that will be applied to all defined steps conditions using the action [`@filter`]("./actions").

```
@filter() = ...
```

This can be useful to avoid repeated sub-conditions in your step conditions.

For example, if we have:

```
{high} < {high[1]} and {volume} > 500
{low} < {low[1]} and {volume} > 500
{close} < {open} and {volume} > 500
```

We can instead use a global filter to avoid repeating `{volume} > 500`, leading to:

```
{high} < {high[1]}
{low} < {low[1]}
{close} < {open}

@filter() = {volume} > 500
```

#### Step Specific Filtering

It is possible to apply filters to specific steps, this is done using the `step` parameter in the `@filter` action.

```
{high} < {high[1]}
{low} < {low[1]}
{close} < {open}

@filter(step=1) = {volume} > 500
```

Here `step=1` refer to the second step where our filtering condition `{volume} > 500` will be applied.

## Visualizing Scripted Alerts Conditions

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/alert-scripting/usage/highlight.png)

In order to make sure the scripted alert corresponds to the desired result and that it triggers as expected, users can visualize when the alert would have triggered using the "Highlight On Chart" setting.

Enabling this setting will display a series of squares located at the top or bottom of the chart. When the condition is true the square will be colored in blue or the selected color from the setting.

<Tip>
  Users can control the location of this highlighter on the chart trough the dropdown menu.

  "Top" and "Bottom" locations are available, while the Oscillator Matrix toolkit also includes a "Center" option.

  "None" will hide the scripted alert highlighting.
</Tip>

## Setting Scripted Alerts

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/alert-scripting/usage/alert_toggle.png)

Once a scripted alert is defined, we can create an alert using it as a condition by enabling the "Scripted Alert" setting in the "Any alert() Function Call" settings group located at the bottom of the toolkit settings.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/alert-scripting/usage/alert.png)

Then we can create the alert by clicking on the alert menu, selecting the toolkit in the condition dropdown, and making sure the dropdown below has "any alert() function call" selected.

## Comments

To make a scripted alert easier to read, users can add comments by starting a line with `//`.

Comments will be ignored when a scripted alert is evaluated.

For example:

```
// Step 1: candle color becomes green
{barcolor} > 0 and not {barcolor[1]} > 0

// Step 2: candle color is red
{barcolor} < 0
```

<div align="center">
  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/alerts/any-alert.png)
</div>

It possible to set only one alert alerting for multiple selected conditions by the users.

Conditions can be selected in the **Any alert() function call** group in the indicator settings. Then the user can set an alert by selecting "any alert() function call" as condition.

<Note>
  Alert conditions for the "any alert() function call" use a `once per bar close` frequency
</Note>

### Any Alert() Function Call Message

Users can set a custom message that will be used when an any alert() function call condition is triggered in the message field below the list of conditions. Users can use placeholders to customize messages and return useful information, the following placeholders are supported:

## Custom Alert Creator

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/alerts/custom.png)

Users wishing to construct more complex alerts using features within the toolkit and/or external indicators can use the **Custom Alert Creator**.

The custom alert creator allows alerting when various user set conditions are met or when a sequence of conditions is complete.

<Tip>
  A user wishing to be alerted when the money flow is bullish (above 50) while the HyperWave is overbought (above 80) could do it as follows:

  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/alerts/custom_example.png)
</Tip>

A custom alert can be triggered as an *any alert() function call* if the setting is selected or as a regular alert when selected in the Tradingview alert creator menu.

### Steps

Steps allow creating a sequence of conditions, which when met trigger an alert. When a condition with a step equal to 1 is met the next condition associated with step 2 will be evaluated (if enabled) and so on for higher steps (if any).

Conditions with the same associated step will require for both conditions to be true in order for the condition associated to a higher step (if any) to be evaluated. This allows certain conditions to act as filters.

<Tip>
  A user wishing to be alerted when the HyperWave cross under 80 after any bearish reversal signal could do it as follows:

  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/alerts/step_example.png)
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Make sure steps are set such that they form a linear sequence. For example if the lowest step is 2 or if the set steps are only 1 and 3 an error will be returned.
</Warning>

#### OR Step Operator

The "OR" step operator can be used to get alerted for any additional condition using "OR" as step, in addition to other set custom alert conditions.

Conditions using the "OR" step can be highlighted using a different color, which can be set from the Custom Alert Creator settings.

#### All Step Operator

The "All" step operator can be used to filter any set "Step" condition, including "OR" and "Invalidate".

This step operator can be useful if all the steps in a sequence needs to obey a specific rule.

<Tip>
  If a user has 2 steps set, and requires both of these to occur at a specific time interval such as 9am to 1pm, then we can use a "Session" condition using the "All" step, requiring our step 1 and step 2 to be occur between 9am and 1pm.
</Tip>

#### Invalidate Step

The "Invalidate" step allows to set a condition as an "invalidation condition". When this condition is triggered while a sequence of conditions is incomplete, the sequence will restart at step 1.

If multiple steps are set as "Invalidate" any of the conditions being true will reset the sequence of conditions, as such not all of them are required to be true for the sequence of conditions to reset.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 2 regular steps and one "Invalidate" step. The alert will trigger when step 2 trigger after step 1 has been triggered.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Invalidation Step">
      Invalidation step condition trigger, we reset the sequence and evaluate step 1 just after.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

### Invalidation Behaviors

Invalidation behaviors allows adding more restrictions to a sequence of conditions, users can use two different invalidation behaviors described below:

#### Invalidate On Step 1

The "Invalidate On Step 1" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when the condition on step 1 trigger. This prevents the first step condition from happening in between other steps of the condition sequence.

This behavior is useful when the first step of our sequence of conditions needs to never be repeated during the sequence.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">
      Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 1 Trigger">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we start evaluating step 2 from now.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

#### Invalidate On Any Repeated Step

The "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when a step is triggered such that it does not respect the set order of conditions.

This behavior is useful when we want a perfectly ordered sequence of conditions to complete, without any step repeating itself.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">
      Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 1 or 2 Trigger">
      Step 1 or 2 conditions trigger, we start evaluating step 1 from now.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

### Maximum Step Interval

Users can determine what is the maximum allowed horizontal distance (in bars) between two steps by enabling the "Maximum Step Interval" setting. This allows restricting steps separated by a large amount of bars.

If the amount of bars since a step exceed the set threshold, then the conditions sequence is reset, and we start evaluating from step 1 again.

### Highlight On Chart

When a custom alert condition is set, a visual element is displayed at the bottom of the chart in order to more easily visualize when the custom alert conditions occur (displayed by default). Users can choose the location of this visual element (top, bottom of the oscillator or centered).

# Confluence
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/oscillator-matrix/confluence



<div align="center">
  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/confluence/settings.png)
</div>

Confluence is an important aspect when dealing with multiple indicators. In this toolkit two features allows the users to easily assess if the confluence between each toolkit element in high or low.

## Confluence Zones

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/confluence/zones.png)

Users can see on the oscillators pane one upper (above 100) and lower (under 0) zone, measuring the bullish/bearish confluence between the Hyper Wave and Money Flow oscillators.

When both the Hyper Wave and Money Flow oscillators are indicating an uptrend the upper zone is colored with a darker green. If only one of the oscillators is indicating an uptrend then the confluence zone will have a brighter green. This logic applies to the lower zone in the case of a downtrend.

<Note>
  Confluence zones have an associated numerical that can be used in external scripts using the output "Upper Confluence Value" for the upper confluence zone and "Lower Confluence Value" for the lower confluence zone, returned values include:

  * 2: Strong confluence
  * 1: Weak confluence
  * 0: No confluence
</Note>

## Confluence Meter

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/confluence/meter.png)

The confluence meter quantifies the amount of confluence between each indication returned by the oscillator, elements taken into account are:

* Trend indicated by the Hyper Wave relative to its signal line
* Trend indicated by the Hyper Wave
* Trend indicated by the Money Flow
* Overflow
* Divergences

The meter giving a higher measurement would be indicative of a more significant bullish confluence, that is most elements are indicative of a bullish trend, while a lower measurement would be indicative of a more significant bearish confluence.

<Note>
  The confluence meter had an associated numerical that can be used in external scripts using the output "Confluence Meter Value"
</Note>


# HyperWave
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/oscillator-matrix/hyperwave



<div align="center">
  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/hyper-wave/settings.png)
</div>

The HyperWave is a normalized adaptive oscillator aiming to precisely reflect price trends without returning a high amount of noise.

It is the primary oscillator used to detect trends/reversals within the LuxAlgo Oscillator Matrix®.

This oscillator is directly controlled by the **Main Length** setting, with higher values returning a smoother result reflecting longer term trends.

<Note>
  The HyperWave and every associated components (Signal line, turning points, divergences) can be disabled by toggling off "Show HyperWave"
</Note>

## Signal Line

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/hyper-wave/signal.png)

The Hyper Wave includes a signal line allowing to reactively detect trend directions. The area between the Hyper Wave and its signal line is displayed to easily assess the current trend direction, with a color determined by the position of the Hyper Wave relative to its signal line.

Users can use two different algorithms for computing the signal line:

* SMA : A simple moving average of the Hyper Wave is used as signal line.
* TS : A trailing stop of the Hyper Wave is used as signal line. This algorithm makes the signal line less sensitive to noisy variations of the Hyper Wave.

| SMA                                                                                                      | TS                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/hyper-wave/sma.png) | ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/hyper-wave/ts.png) |

The users can select the length of the signal line using the numerical input at the right of the **Signal** drop-down menu.

<Tip>
  It can be more interesting to use a higher signal line length when the **Main Length** setting is high.
</Tip>

## Turning Points

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/hyper-wave/turning-points.png)

Crosses made between the HyperWave and its signal line are highlighted by dots on the oscillators pane, these are **turning points**.

By default, a Hyper Wave crossing over the signal line is highlighted in green while a Hyper Wave crossing under the signal line is highlighted in red.

### Overbought/Oversold Turning Points

The displayed turning points exist in different sizes, with bigger dots occurring when the crosses are made within an overbought/oversold area.

* Oversold Turning Point : Occurs when the Hyper Wave cross over its signal line while the Hyper Wave is under 20
* Overbought Turning Point : Occurs when the Hyper Wave cross under its signal line while the Hyper Wave is over 80

## Real Time Divergences

<div align="center">
  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/hyper-wave/divergences-settings.png)
</div>

Divergences between the price and the HyperWave oscillator are detected in real-time. The users can return longer term divergences by decreasing the **Divergence Sensitivity %**, with lower values of this setting making divergence detection more sensitive to noisy variations of the Hyper Wave.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/hyper-wave/divergences.png)

Divergences are highlighted by a blue line for bullish divergences and by a red line for bearish divergences.

### Divergences On Price Chart

In order to reference the price points returning the divergence with the HyperWave, divergences lines are directly displayed on the user price chart thanks to "Show Divergences On Chart".

It is important to note that, unlike the divergence lines that appear in the oscillator pane, the divergence lines on the user chart do not appear exactly where the divergences are detected; rather, they are set retrospectively.

<Note>
  Because the amount of lines is limited to a maximum of 500, disabling "Show Divergences On Chart" can increase the amount of historical divergences highlighted on the oscillator pane.
</Note>

Oscillator Matrix® is an all-in-one indicator that incorporates 6+ unique components designed for interoperability & confluence with one another to provide a powerful trend following & reversal detection experience.

Users can create various ways to utilize the indicator's features together such as looking for excess money flowing into the market alongside strong reversal signals appearing, or getting real-time divergence signals alongside a lack of money flowing into the market to predict upcoming trends.

This indicator is described as an 'Oscillator Matrix' as it's made up of many different components that can create a systematic approach to analyzing markets alone, however, the indicator also can serve as a great secondary piece to a user's primary analysis with or without our other LuxAlgo Premium indicators.

</div>

Oscillator Matrix® comes with a complete trend reversals detection system, allowing users to timely assess when a trend is changing direction.

## Classification

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/reversal-signals/reversals.png)

Different kind of reversals are returned on the oscillators pane, minor (-) and major (+) reversals signals.

Minor reversals are frequent signals often indicative of shorter term reversals, such as the top/bottom of an impulse (thus announcing a retracement). Minor reversals are highlighted by circles.

Major reversals can occur later in a trend, and can be indicative of a more significant reversals. Major reversals are highlighted by triangles.

### Invalidation Behavior

<ResponseField name="Dropdown" type="Numerical">
  <Expandable title="Expand">
    <ResponseField name="None" default>
      No invalidation behavior.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="Invalidate On Step 1">
      The "Invalidate On Step 1" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when the condition on step 1 trigger. This prevents the first step condition from happening in between other steps of the condition sequence.

      This behavior is useful when the first step of our sequence of conditions needs to never be repeated during the sequence.

      <Card title="Example">
        Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Step 1">
            Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 2">
            Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 1 Trigger">
            Step 1 condition trigger, we start evaluating step 2 from now.
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Card>
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="Invalidate On Any Repeated Step">
      The "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when a step is triggered such that it does not respect the user-set order of conditions.

      This behavior is useful when we want a perfectly ordered sequence of conditions to complete, without any step repeating itself.

      <Card title="Example">
        Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Step 1">
            Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 2">
            Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 1 or 2 Trigger">
            Step 1 or 2 conditions trigger, we start evaluating step 1 from now.
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Card>

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

Invalidation behaviors allows adding more restrictions to a sequence of conditions, users can use two different invalidation behaviors described below.

### Maximum Step Interval

<ResponseField name="Numerical Input" type="default:10" />

Maximum allowed horizontal distance (in bars) between two steps.

If the amount of bars since a step exceed the selected threshold, then the conditions sequence is reset, and we start evaluating from step 1 again.

### Highlight Custom Alert Triggers

<ResponseField name="Toggle" type="default:true" />

When a custom alert condition is set, a visual element is displayed at the bottom of the chart in order to more easily visualize when the custom alert conditions occurs (displayed by default).

### Calculated Bars

<ResponseField name="Numerical" type="default:10000" />

Amount of most recent bars used for the calculation of the toolkit. Lower values allow returning faster computation times.


# Smart Money Flow
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/oscillator-matrix/smart-money-flow



<div align="center">
  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/smart-money-flow/settings.png)
</div>

Money Flow and liquidity are core concepts with the Oscillator Matrix®. Various elements centered around this concept are provided to detect longer term trends, assess market participants behaviours, and detect reversals.

<Note>
  The Money Flow and every associated components (overflow, thresholds) can be disabled by toggling off "Show Money Flow"
</Note>

## Money Flow

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/smart-money-flow/money-flow.png)

The toolkit include one money flow indicator that aims to detect trends based on market participants activity.

Compared to the Hyper Wave the Money Flow oscillator can return longer term indications and be used to support shorter term indications.

## Overflow

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/smart-money-flow/overflow.png)

Overflow occurs when excessive liquidity relative to a trend length enters the market, this can highlight late trend following participants entering the market, and can announce potential reversals.

### Money Flow Thresholds

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-oscillator/smart-money-flow/thresholds.png)

Users can gauge market activity by using the provided Money Flow thresholds, two extremities displayed above/under the central 50 levels.

When the Money Flow oscillator is above the upper threshold there is significant one-sided bullish activity on the market. When the Money Flow oscillator is under the lower threshold there is significant one-sided bearish activity on the market.

Money flow fluctuating within the thresholds can highlight a more balanced market.

The Price Action Concepts® can alert users for multiple events relevant to the existing features in the toolkit. To learn more about how to set alerts in general see [how to create alerts on tradingview](/docs/getting-started/tradingview-alerts).

<Note>
  In order for an alert to work in the toolkit make sure the related feature is enabled
</Note>

## Any Alert() Function Call

Users can create a single alert for multiple conditions using the *any alert() function call* alert condition. Conditions users want to be alerted for are grouped by the type of features they affect (structures, volumetric order blocks, imbalances...etc) and are located at the bottom of the toolkit settings.

Once conditions are toggled on users only need to set an alert using the *any alert() function call* as condition.

## Custom Alert Creator

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/alerts/custom.png)

Users wishing to construct more complex alerts using features within the toolkit and/or external indicators can use the **Custom Alert Creator**.

The custom alert creator allows alerting when various user-set conditions are met or when a sequence of conditions is complete.

<Tip>
  A user wishing to be alerted when any internal market structure occurs within 1AM and 5AM of the symbol timezone could do it as follows:

  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/alerts/custom_example.png)
</Tip>

A custom alert can be triggered as an *any alert() function call* if the setting is selected or as a regular alert when selected in the Tradingview alert creator menu.

### Steps

Steps allow creating a sequence of conditions, which when met trigger an alert. When a condition with a step equal to 1 is met the next condition associated with step 2 will be evaluated (if enabled) and so on for higher steps (if any).

Conditions with the same associated step will require both conditions to be true in order for the condition associated with a higher step (if any) to be evaluated. This allows certain conditions to act as filters.

<Tip>
  A user wishing to be alerted when the price enters a bullish imbalance after any internal bullish market structure could do it as follows:

  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/alerts/step_example.png)

  *Make sure internal market structures and imbalances are enabled*.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Make sure steps are set such that they form a linear sequence. For example, if the lowest step is 2 or if the set steps are only 1 and 3 an error will be returned.
</Warning>

#### OR Step Operator

The "OR" step operator can be used to get alerted for any additional condition using "OR" as a step, in addition to other set custom alert conditions.

Conditions using the "OR" step can be highlighted using a different color, which can be set from the Custom Alert Creator settings. Users can choose the location of this visual element (top or bottom of the chart).

#### All Step Operator

The "All" step operator can be used to filter any set "Step" condition, including "OR" and "Invalidate".

This step operator can be useful if all the steps in a sequence needs to obey a specific rule.

<Tip>
  If a user has 2 steps set, and requires both of these to occur at a specific time interval such as 9am to 1pm, then we can use a "Session" condition using the "All" step, requiring our step 1 and step 2 to be occur between 9am and 1pm.
</Tip>

#### Invalidate Step

The "Invalidate" step allows to set a condition as an "invalidation condition". When this condition is triggered while a sequence of conditions is incomplete, the sequence will restart at step 1.

If multiple steps are set as "Invalidate" any of the conditions being true will reset the sequence of conditions, as such not all of them are required to be true for the sequence of conditions to reset.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 2 regular steps and one "Invalidate" step. The alert will trigger when step 2 trigger after step 1 has been triggered.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Invalidation Step">
      Invalidation step condition trigger, we reset the sequence and evaluate step 1 just after.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

### Invalidation Behaviors

Invalidation behaviors allows adding more restrictions to a sequence of conditions, users can use two different invalidation behaviors described below:

#### Invalidate On Step 1

The "Invalidate On Step 1" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when the condition on step 1 trigger. This prevents the first step condition from happening in between other steps of the condition sequence.

This behavior is useful when the first step of our sequence of conditions needs to never be repeated during the sequence.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">
      Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 1 Trigger">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we start evaluating step 2 from now.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

#### Invalidate On Any Repeated Step

The "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when a step is triggered such that it does not respect the set order of conditions.

This behavior is useful when we want a perfectly ordered sequence of conditions to complete, without any step repeating itself.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">
      Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 1 or 2 Trigger">
      Step 1 or 2 conditions trigger, we start evaluating step 1 from now.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

### Maximum Step Interval

Users can determine what is the maximum allowed horizontal distance (in bars) between two steps by enabling the "Maximum Step Interval" setting. This allows restricting steps separated by a large amount of bars.

If the amount of bars since a step exceed the set threshold, then the conditions sequence is reset, and we start evaluating from step 1 again.

### Highlight On Chart

When a custom alert condition is set, a visual element is displayed at the bottom of the chart in order to more easily visualize when the custom alert condition occurs (displayed by default).

# Fibonacci Retracements
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/fibonacci



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/retracements/settings.png)

Fibonacci retracements are levels displayed from two price points using Fibonacci ratios, specific numbers obtained from the Fibonacci sequence.

Users can display up to 5 customizable Fibonacci retracements from one upper and one lower extremities users can select from a wide variety of feature included in the toolkit.

## Possible Extremities

The upper/lower extremities used to construct the Fibonacci retracements can be selected from the "Fibonacci Top" or "Fibonacci Bottom" dropdown settings, and can be obtained from the following features within the Price Action Concepts® toolkit:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Swing Points">
    * Internal High
    * Internal Low
    * Swing High
    * Swing Low
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Premium/Discount">
    * Discount
    * Equilibrium Average
    * Premium
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CHoCH/BOS">
    * Bullish I-CHoCH
    * Bearish I-CHoCH
    * Bullish I-BOS
    * Bearish I-BOS
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Orderblock">
    * Highest OB Top
    * Lowest  OB Bottom
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Imbalance">
    * Imbalance Top
    * Imbalance Bottom
    * Imbalance Average
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Previous H/L">
    * Previous Day High
    * Previous Day Low
    * Previous Week High
    * Previous Week Low
    * Previous Month High
    * Previous Month Low
    * Previous Quarterly High
    * Previous Quarterly Low
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Selecting "None" for "Fibonacci Top" or "Fibonacci Bottom" will hide the retracements.

## Ratios

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/retracements/levels.png)

Users can control which levels are displayed as well as the ratio used for each level. Ratios are also visible to the right side of each retracement displayed.

## Anchor To Origin

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/retracements/origin.png)

By default, the levels are anchored from the most recent bar and extend 20 bars ahead. By enabling "Anchor To Origin" users can anchor retracement levels to a point of origin related to the selected extremities in "Fibonacci Top" and "Fibonacci Bottom".

Based on the selected extremity, the anchor point will be the following:

| Extremity                                | Anchor                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Swing High                               | Swing High Location                                      |
| Swing Low                                | Swing Low Location                                       |
| Internal High                            | Internal High Location                                   |
| Internal Low                             | Internal Low Location                                    |
| Premium / Equilibrium Average / Discount | Oldest anchor between Swing High and Swing Low Locations |

<Info>
  Only the above extremities are compatible with "Anchor To Origin".
</Info>

If "Fibonacci Top" and "Fibonacci Bottom" are different, the anchor point will be the oldest location between the two.


# Imbalance Concepts
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/imbalances



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/imbalances/settings.png)

Imbalances in market prices arise when there is a great disparity between supply and demand, this can lead to inefficiencies where an asset does not trade at its fair value.

It is common for the price to seek balance after an imbalance, thus returning to the price area where the imbalance occurred. These areas of imbalances can also be used as support and resistance areas.

The toolkit is able to detect the following imbalances:

* Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
* Inverse Fair Value Gaps (Inverse FVG)
* Double Fair Value Gaps (Double FVG)
* Volume Imbalance
* Opening Gap

Each method is covered in the sections below.

## Fair Value Gaps

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/imbalances/fvg.png)

Fair Value Gaps (FVG) are market imbalances formed from a sequence of three candles where the outer candle wicks fail to overlap the central candle body, the range between the wicks highlight a Fair Value Gap.

Bullish fair value gaps occur when the current price low is higher than the price high two bars ago. Bearish fair gaps occur when the current price high is lower than the price low two bars ago.

## Inverse FVG

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/imbalances/ifvg.png)

Inverse fair value gaps are essentially mitigated fair value gaps, these can be used to provide retests areas.

A mitigated bullish FVG will lead to a bearish inverse FVG, where we can expect price to retrace upward and retest the area, while a mitigated bearish FVG will lead to a bullish inverse FVG, where we can expect price to retrace downward and retest the area.

<Info>
  For the sake of efficiency, inverse FVG's are always based on the mitigation of the most recent detected FVG, disregarding any previous historical FVG that might get mitigated.
</Info>

## Double FVG

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/imbalances/bpr.png)

Double Fair Value Gaps, also called balanced price ranges occur when the areas of two Fair Value Gaps overlap. The overlapping areas highlight a new area of imbalance.

A bullish Balanced Price Range is determined by a new bullish Fair Value Gap area overlapping a previous bearish Fair Value Gap area, while a bearish Balanced Price Range is determined by a new bearish Fair Value Gap area overlapping a previous bullish Fair Value Gap area.

## Volume Imbalance

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/imbalances/vi.png)

Volume Imbalances are market imbalances characterised by two adjacent candles with non overlapping candle bodies, while their wicks overlaps. These imbalances are more commonly found in stocks or second timeframes of cryptocurrencies and forex pairs.

## Opening Gap

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/imbalances/og.png)

Opening Gaps are market imbalances characterised by two adjacent candles with non overlapping candle wicks, highlighting an empty area. These imbalances are more commonly found in stocks or second timeframes of cryptocurrencies and forex pairs.

## Mitigation Methods

Once price breaks a highlighted imbalance area it is said to have been "mitigated" and will automatically disappear. Within the Price Action Concepts® indicator, users can determine the condition for any imbalance to be considered mitigated trough the **Mitigation Method** setting, available options include:

|    Method   |                                                                                               Description                                                                                               |
| :---------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  **Close**  |           Mitigates an imbalance once price close cross above the imbalance upper extremity in the case of a bearish imbalance, and under its lower extremity in case of a bullish imbalance.           |
|   **Wick**  | Mitigates an imbalance once price high cross above the imbalance upper extremity in the case of a bearish imbalance, and when price low cross under its lower extremity in case of a bullish imbalance. |
| **Average** |                                                                Mitigates an imbalance once price cross the imbalance area average level.                                                                |
|   **None**  |                                                                                  Will not remove mitigated imbalances.                                                                                  |

<Note>
  This toolkit makes use of a buffer allowing for a maximum of 200 imbalances. Any newly detected imbalance making the buffer exceed this number will cause the toolkit to discard the oldest detected imbalance.
</Note>

## Volatility Threshold

The volatility threshold allows filtering out less significant imbalances, with higher values preserving imbalances with a larger range.

<Note>
  The volatility threshold is determined from a volatility estimator, the threshold act as a multiplier.

  Increments of 1 will return visible results. Floating points can be used.
</Note>

## Alerts

Users can be alerted on the detection of a bullish or bearish imbalance, as well as when an imbalance area is mitigated.

# Liquidity Concepts
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/liquidity



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/liquidity/settings.png)

Price Action Concepts® covers a variety of concepts related to liquidity. Each of these concepts can be found in the **Liquidity Concepts** settings section and are described in the sections below.

## Liquidity Trendlines

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/liquidity/trendlines.png)

Liquidity Trendlines displays linear zones constructed by taking into account the amount of liquidity at certain price levels, with zones being displayed only if market participants found liquidity in them. The returned zones can give support areas (in blue) during up-trends or resistance areas (in red) during down-trends.

Once price breaks the extremity of a zone we can expect a trend reversal.

<Note>
  Once the conditions for a trendline to be displayed are met, the indicator will display it retrospectively.
</Note>

The user can determine the amount of historical up-trendlines and down-trendlines to display on the chart to avoid clutter using the provided numerical input setting.

<Note>
  Builtins alerts for trendlines breakouts are available to the users.
</Note>

## Patterns

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/liquidity/image530.png)

Price Action Concepts® includes an Automatic Pattern Detection feature able to detect various chart patterns as well as a dashboard to give users information about any detected pattern.

The Pattern Detection feature is able to detect the following patterns:

* Ascending/Descending Triangles
* Ascending/Descending Broadening Wedges
* Ascending/Descending/Symmetrical Triangles
* Double Tops/Bottoms
* Head & Shoulders
* Inverted Head & Shoulders

as well as providing general supports and resistances if any of the above patterns are not detected.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/liquidity/dashboard.png)

When a pattern is detected, it will be displayed on the dashboard located at the top-right of the chart. Solid lines will highlight the patterns. When no patterns are detected, dashed lines will be displayed that can be used as support and resistance.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/liquidity/image602.png)

Users can detect longer term chart patterns using the provided numerical drop-down menu setting, with higher values detecting longer term patterns.

<Note>
  Builtins alerts for detected patterns are available to the users.
</Note>

## Equal Highs & Lows

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/liquidity/eqhl.png)

The toolkit returns historical equal high's & low's constructed from swing points. Equal high's & low's can be indicative of reversals, and incoming market structure such as CHoCH or BOS.

Users can display longer term equal high's/low's by increasing the numerical input at the right of the toggle (3 by default).

<Note>
  Equal high's & low's requires the detected swing points to be confirmed, which takes an amount of bars equal to the value set in the numerical input. As such it is important to understand these are displayed retrospectively.
</Note>

## Liquidity Grabs

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/liquidity/grabs.png)

Liquidity Grabs highlight occurrences where trading activity took place in more liquid areas. These are highlighted by the toolkit with colored borders. A liquidity grab can be identified as a bullish grab if the activity took place in a demand area, or a bearish grab if this activity took place in a supply area.

Bullish liquidity grabs are highlighted in blue with borders ranging from the price low to candle body minimum and indicates a potential bullish reversal.

Bearish liquidity grabs are highlighted in red with borders ranging from the price high to candle body maximum and indicates a potential bearish reversal.

The occurrence of both bullish and bearish liquidity grabs at the same time can highlight market indecision's.

<Note>
  Built-in alerts for liquidity grabs are available to users within Price Action Concepts®.
</Note>


# Market Structure
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/market-structures



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/structures/settings.png)

Market structure is a core component of the price action. The Price Action Concepts® toolkit automatically detects and highlights real time market structure on your chart, allowing for a clean picture of market trends without introducing traditional forms of technical analysis like moving averages.

## Type Of Market Structures

![Type of market structures](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/structures/type-structures.png)

Market structure allows traders to understand trend reversals as well as trend continuations in the market through two distinct identifications:

* Change of Character (CHoCH)
* Break of Structure (BOS)

These are further described in the subsections below.

### Change Of Character (CHoCH)

![Type of CHoCH's](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/structures/CHoCH.png)

A change of character (CHoCH), sometimes also referred as 'market structure shift' is characterized by price breaking a prior swing low during an uptrend (bullish CHoCH) or a prior swing high during a downtrend (bearish CHoCH), and thus indicates a potential market reversal.

The Price Action Concepts® toolkits  labels two distinct type of CHoCHs:

* Leading CHoCH (labelled as **CHoCH**)
* Supported CHoCH (labelled as **CHoCH+**)

The difference between each is based on the relative position of prior swing highs/lows. A leading CHoCH is characterized by price not having prior signs of a reversal, such as a failed higher high (lower high) during an uptrend or a failed lower low (higher low) during a downtrend.

On the other hand, a supported CHoCH (**CHoCH+**) is preceded by an early sign of market reversal, such as a failed higher high (lower high) during an uptrend or a failed lower low (higher low) during a downtrend.

<Note>
  Users can show allow the toolkit to show all or only specific types of CHoCH's from the drop-down menus within the **Market Structure** settings section in the toolkit.
</Note>

### Break Of Structure (BOS)

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/structures/BOS.png)

A break of structure (BOS) can be thought of primarily as a trend continuation label. This structure is the opposite of the CHoCH, with a BOS being when price breaks a prior swing high during an uptrend (bullish BOS) thus forming a new higher high, or when price breaks a prior swing low during a downtrend (bearish BOS) thus forming a new lower low. This structure only can occur after a CHoCH.

Since BOS's indicate trend continuations, it is common to observe successive BOS's.

## Swing & Internal Structure

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/structures/structures.png)

The Price Action Concepts® toolkit offers two distinct dimensions when it comes to market structure:

* Internal Structure
* Swing Structure

Internal structure are constructed from shorter term swing high/low points, while swing structure are constructed from longer term ones. Users can select the lookback used for the swing point detection for both the internal and swing market structures construction.

Internal structures can use a lookback in range (5, 49). Swing structures can use a lookback in the range (50, 100).

The toolkit highlights internal structure with dashed lines and labels with a smaller text size.

<Note>
  The size of the labels for internal and swing structure can be changed from the **General Styling** settings section.
</Note>

## Candle Coloring

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/structures/coloring.png)

Users can color candles depending on the detected internal market structure. This is useful if users want to be able to determine a detected internal market structure without having labels and lines on their chart, freeing up space on the chart to use other indicators.

Candle coloring is affected by the colors settings selected by the user for the internal market structure. Candle coloring is determined as follows:

* Darker bullish color : Bullish CHoCH active
* Regular bullish color : Bullish BOS active
* Darker bearish color : Bearish CHoCH active
* Regular bearish color : Bearish BOS active

<Note>
  Users can make highlighted structure and candle colors monochrome from the **General Styling** settings by using the *monochrome* option in the **Theme** drop down menu.
</Note>

## Swing High/Low

Users can display swing high/low by enabling the "Show Swing High/Low" setting, highlighting past points where a reversal occurred. Displayed swing points can be denoted as:

* HH (Higher high)
* HL (Higher low)
* LH (Lower high)
* LL (Lower low)

The displayed swing points are affected by the period selected for the internal market structures, with higher values returning longer term swing points.

<Warning>
  Swing points are displayed retrospectively, and as such are not detected where they are located. They should not be used for real-time applications.
</Warning>

## Strong/Weak High/Low

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/structures/strongweak.png)

Strong/Weak High/Lows highlight maximum and minimum levels made from medium term swings. A relative percentage derived between the trading volume that occurred on both swings is also highlighted, and is used to determine if a maxima/minima is strong or weak.

The displayed swing points are affected by the period selected for the internal market structures, with higher values returning longer term swing points.

## Alerts

Built-in alerts are available for each supported market structure, including swing structures, internal structures, and equal highs/lows.


# Volumetric Order Blocks
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/order-blocks



Volumetric Order Blocks highlight price areas where more informed market participants accumulate orders and can be used as potential areas of support or resistance. These are automatically highlighted by the toolkit and will disappear once mitigated.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/order-blocks/settings.png)

These order Blocks are separated into two types, bullish Volumetric Order Blocks and bearish Volumetric Order Blocks. Bullish Volumetric Order Blocks initial locations are near swing low's and are used as a potential support. On the other hand Bearish Volumetric Order Blocks initial locations are near swing high's and are used as a potential resistance.

Users can show longer term Volumetric Order Blocks by increasing the **Length** setting in the Order Blocks section. This setting control the swing point detection lookback used to construct Volumetric Order Blocks.

<Tip>
  You can hide overlapping Volumetric Order Blocks by using the **Hide Overlap** setting, if two Volumetric Order Blocks overlap the most recent one will be conserved.
</Tip>

## Breaker Blocks

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/order-blocks/breakers.png)

Breaker Blocks show previous Volumetric Order Blocks that got mitigated (broken by price). These zones can be revisited by the price and provide support/resistance areas.

Bullish breaker blocks disappear once price goes above the breaker block upper extremity, while bearish breaker blocks disappear once price goes under the breaker block lower extremity.

Users can enable the option of showing breaker blocks by enabling the "Show Breakers" setting.

<Note>
  Breaker blocks are differentiated from Volumetric Order Blocks by their non-solid background color.
</Note>

## Internal Activity & Metrics

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/order-blocks/activity.png)

The toolkit is able to return various information regarding an order block. Internal activity highlight the bullish and bearish activity within the interval used to construct the order block, with green bars highlighting bullish activity, and red bars highlighting bearish activity.

This allows users to see if the activity associated to an order block is in accordance with its type, or if the activity is uniform. Users can utilize this to estimate when bulls or bears are potentially exhausted at certain order blocks in the market, as such it can be used to further understand if price is likely to break or respect an order block.

<Note>
  Internal activity and metrics both require volume data in order to be displayed.
</Note>

### Metrics

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/order-blocks/metrics.png)

Metrics are displayed to the right of an order block near the most recent historical price bar. This information represent the accumulated volume within the interval used to construct the order block, and can be useful to determine how significant an order block is, with larger volume indicating a more significant order block.

The percentage to the right indicates how much the volume of an order block account for the total accumulated volume of all Volumetric Order Blocks displayed on the chart, this allows to quickly determine which Volumetric Order Blocks can be more interesting to look for.

<Tip>
  You can change the size of the metrics from the **OB Metrics Size** setting within the **GENERAL STYLING** settings section, available options include: *tiny*, *small* (default), *normal*, and *auto*.
</Tip>

### Processing Internal Activity Data

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/order-blocks/processing.png)

Users interested in accessing and highlighting occurrence of specific conditions related to the internal activity of the most recent order block can use the "OB Volume" condition creator in the [custom alert creator](./alerts#custom-alert-creator).

This condition creator includes the following conditions:

|           Condition           |                                                                                  Description                                                                                 |
| :---------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|         **Buy Volume**        |                                                             Buy volume associated to the most recent order block.                                                            |
|        **Sell Volume**        |                                                            Sell volume associated to the most recent order block.                                                            |
|        **Total Volume**       |                                                            Total volume associated to the most recent order block.                                                           |
|         **Percentage**        |                                                         Volume percentage associated to the most recent order block.                                                         |
|  **Buy Volume > Sell Volume** |                                         Return true if the buy volume is greater than the sell volume of the most recent order block.                                        |
| **Buy Volume \< Sell Volume** |                                          Return true if the buy volume is lower than the sell volume of the most recent order block.                                         |
|    **Positive Association**   | Return true if buy volume is greater than sell volume in the case of a bullish order block, or if buy volume is lower than sell volume in the case of a bullish order block. |
|    **Negative Association**   | Return true if buy volume is lower than sell volume in the case of a bullish order block, or if buy volume is greater than sell volume in the case of a bullish order block. |

<Note>
  This data is always associated with the most recent order block, regardless of its mitigation status.
</Note>

When "Buy Volume", "Sell Volume", "Total Volume", or "Percentage" are selected we want to compare these values to a user set value as reference using the following comparison operators:

* Greater Than
* Lower Than
* Equal

## Mitigation Methods

Once price break an order block this order block is said to have been "mitigated", and will automatically disappear. Users can determine the condition for an order block to be considered mitigated through the **Mitigation Method** setting, each method is described below:

|    Method   |                                                                                             Description                                                                                             |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  **Close**  |           Mitigates an order block once price close cross above its upper extremity in the case of a bearish order block, and under its lower extremity in case of a bullish order block.           |
|   **Wick**  | Mitigates an order block once price high cross above its upper extremity in the case of a bearish order block, and when price low cross under its lower extremity in case of a bullish order block. |
| **Average** |                                                                     Mitigates an order block once price cross its average level.                                                                    |

## MTF Order Blocks

![15m chart with 1h Volumetric Order Blocks (left) and 1h chart with 1h Volumetric Order Blocks (right)](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/order-blocks/mtf_ob.png)

The user can display internal and swing Volumetric Order Blocks of a high or lower chart timeframe on the chart using the **Timeframe** settings. The displayed Volumetric Order Blocks will have the same price values and volume data than the ones of the selected timeframe.

<Warning>
  The time location of an order block of a different timeframe can differ from the location on its chart timeframe, these behaviors is proper to the tools used to retrieve Volumetric Order Blocks data on different timeframe.

  This can also affect when an order block data is retrieved, potentially causing mitigated Volumetric Order Blocks to appear unmitigated.

# Premium & Discount Zones
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/price-action-concepts/pdzones



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/zones/settings.png)

Premium & Discount zones highlight three specific price areas, one upper area (premium), one central area (equilibrium), and one lower area (discount).

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/zones/premium-discount.png)

These areas can be used to know when an event is occurring at a premium, discount, or within an equilibrium zone.

<Note>
  If a condition indicative of an uptrend occur within a discount zone then it would have an higher chance of being the cause of a reversal, this also applies for a condition indicative of a downtrend occurring within the premium zone.
</Note>

Additionally, each area can be used as a support or resistance.


# Highs & Lows MTF

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-pa/previous-hl/settings.png)

It is common for traders to use the maximum and minimum price value reached in a previous day, week, month, or on specific periods as support and resistances levels.

The toolkit is able to return levels from the maximum and minimum price value reached during:

* The previous day
* Mondays
* The previous week
* The previous month
* Quarters

### Invalidation Behavior

<ResponseField name="Dropdown" type="Numerical">
  <Expandable title="Expand">
    <ResponseField name="None" default>
      No invalidation behavior.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="Invalidate On Step 1">
      The "Invalidate On Step 1" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when the condition on step 1 trigger. This prevents the first step condition from happening in between other steps of the condition sequence.

      This behavior is useful when the first step of our sequence of conditions needs to never be repeated during the sequence.

      <Card title="Example">
        Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Step 1">
            Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 2">
            Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 1 Trigger">
            Step 1 condition trigger, we start evaluating step 2 from now.
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Card>
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="Invalidate On Any Repeated Step">
      The "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when a step is triggered such that it does not respect the user-set order of conditions.

      This behavior is useful when we want a perfectly ordered sequence of conditions to complete, without any step repeating itself.

      <Card title="Example">
        Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Step 1">
            Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 2">
            Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 1 or 2 Trigger">
            Step 1 or 2 conditions trigger, we start evaluating step 1 from now.
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Card>
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

Invalidation behaviors allow adding more restrictions to a sequence of conditions; users can use two different invalidation behaviors described below.

### Maximum Step Interval

<ResponseField name="Numerical Input" type="default:10" />

Maximum allowed horizontal distance (in bars) between two steps.

If the number of bars since a step exceeds the selected threshold, then the condition sequence is reset, and we start evaluating from step 1 again.

### Highlight Custom Alert Triggers

<ResponseField name="Toggle" type="default:true" />

When a custom alert condition is set, a visual element is displayed at the bottom of the chart in order to more easily visualize when the custom alert conditions occurs (displayed by default).

## Calculation

### Calculated Bars

<ResponseField name="Numerical" type="default:10 000" />

Limits the initial calculation of the toolkit to the specified amount of most recent bars. Lower values will return a faster computation time. A value of 0 will compute the toolkit over the entire data history.

## Using Placeholders With Confirmation/Contrarian Alerts

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/alerts/image620.png)

When creating an alert using 'Any Confirmation' or 'Any Contrarian' it is possible to use placeholders so that the alert message returns the type of signal that triggered the alert.

In order to do so, paste the following line in the message field:

```
Bullish : {{plot("Bullish")}} | Bearish : {{plot("Bearish")}} | Bullish+: {{plot("Bullish+")}} | Bearish+ : {{plot("Bearish+")}}
```

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/alerts/image31.png)

## Any Alert() Function Call

The *any alert() function call* alert condition allows to create one alert using various conditions, this allows to bypass the limit of one alert for free users as well as making the process of updating many alerts faster and easier.

To create such an alert go to the indicator settings, and scroll down to the '**ANY ALERT() FUNCTION CALL CONDITIONS**' section.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/alerts/conditions.png)

Toggle on the conditions of interest. Now create a new alert, in the first **Condition** drop-down menu select the **LuxAlgo Premium** indicator, in the second drop-down menu select **Any alert() function call**, you can then create the alert.

<Note>
  This alert would use **once per bar close** by default.
</Note>

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/alerts/image117.png)

<Note>
  All-in-one alerts do not differ from regular alerts, they will be using the same indicator settings as the one used during their creation. Note however that you cannot set a custom message for all-in-one alerts, the message displayed when the selected conditions trigger will be the same as the one used in the same individual alert conditions.
</Note>

### Any Alert() Function Call Message

Users can set a custom message that will be used when an "any alert() function call" condition is triggered in the message field below the list of conditions. Users can use placeholders to customize messages and return useful information, the following placeholders are supported:

### Format as JSON

Use the following message template to receive "any alert() function call" messages in the JSON format:

```json
{
  "alert": "{default}",
  "ticker": "{ticker}",
  "tf": "{tf}",
  "ohlcv":{
    "open": {open},
    "high": {high},
    "low": {low},
    "close": {close},
    "volume": {volume}
  },
  "bartime": {time}
}
```

### Updating Alerts Using Any Alert() Function Call

If you already set an *any alert() function call* alert and want to change the indicator settings or want to toggle on another condition all you need to do is edit the alert you want to update, select the second instance of the indicator in the first **Condition** drop-down menu and then click on save.

## Custom Alert Creator

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/alerts/custom.png)

Users wishing to construct more complex alerts using features within the toolkit and/or external indicators can use the **Custom Alert Creator**.

The custom alert creator allows alerting when various user-set conditions are met or when a sequence of conditions is complete.

<Tip>
  A user wishing to be alerted when any bullish signal occurs while the smart trail is bullish could do it as follows:

  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/alerts/custom_example.png)
</Tip>

A custom alert can be triggered as an *any alert() function call* if the setting is selected or as a regular alert when selected in the Tradingview alert creator menu.

### Steps

Steps allow creating a sequence of conditions, which when met trigger an alert. When a condition with a step equal to 1 is met the next condition associated with step 2 will be evaluated (if enabled) and so on for higher steps (if any).

Conditions with the same associated step will require both conditions to be true in order for the condition associated with a higher step (if any) to be evaluated. This allows certain conditions to act as filters.

<Tip>
  A user wishing to be alerted for any bullish confirmation signal classified as 1 or 2 by the ML Classifier occurring after the smart trail turned bullish could do it as follows:

  ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/alerts/step_example.png)

  *Make sure the ML Classifier is enabled*.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Make sure steps are set such that they form a linear sequence. For example, if the lowest step is 2 or if the set steps are only 1 and 3 an error will be returned.
</Warning>

#### OR Step Operator

The "OR" step operator can be used to get alerted for any additional condition using "OR" as step, in addition to other set custom alert conditions.

Conditions using the "OR" step can be highlighted using a different color, which can be set from the Custom Alert Creator settings. Users can choose the location of this visual element (top or bottom of the chart).

#### All Step Operator

The "All" step operator can be used to filter any set "Step" condition, including "OR" and "Invalidate".

This step operator can be useful if all the steps in a sequence needs to obey a specific rule.

<Tip>
  If a user has 2 steps set, and requires both of these to occur at a specific time interval such as 9am to 1pm, then we can use a "Session" condition using the "All" step, requiring our step 1 and step 2 to be occur between 9am and 1pm.
</Tip>

#### Invalidate Step

The "Invalidate" step allows to set a condition as an "invalidation condition". When this condition is triggered while a sequence of conditions is incomplete, the sequence will restart at step 1.

If multiple steps are set as "Invalidate" any of the conditions being true will reset the sequence of conditions, as such not all of them are required to be true for the sequence of conditions to reset.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 2 regular steps and one "Invalidate" step. The alert will trigger when step 2 trigger after step 1 has been triggered.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Invalidation Step">
      Invalidation step condition trigger, we reset the sequence and evaluate step 1 just after.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

### Invalidation Behaviors

Invalidation behaviors allows adding more restrictions to a sequence of conditions, users can use two different invalidation behaviors described below:

#### Invalidate On Step 1

The "Invalidate On Step 1" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when the condition on step 1 trigger. This prevents the first step condition from happening in between other steps of the condition sequence.

This behavior is useful when the first step of our sequence of conditions needs to never be repeated during the sequence.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">
      Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 1 Trigger">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we start evaluating step 2 from now.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

#### Invalidate On Any Repeated Step

The "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when a step is triggered such that it does not respect the set order of conditions.

This behavior is useful when we want a perfectly ordered sequence of conditions to complete, without any step repeating itself.

<Card title="Example">
  Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1">
      Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 2">
      Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 1 or 2 Trigger">
      Step 1 or 2 conditions trigger, we start evaluating step 1 from now.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Card>

### Maximum Step Interval

Users can determine what is the maximum allowed horizontal distance (in bars) between two steps by enabling the "Maximum Step Interval" setting. This allows restricting steps separated by a large amount of bars.

If the amount of bars since a step exceed the set threshold, then the conditions sequence is reset, and we start evaluating from step 1 again.

### Highlight On Chart

When a custom alert condition is set, a visual element is displayed at the bottom of the chart in order to more easily visualize when the custom alert conditions occurs (displayed by default).

# Candle Coloring
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/candle-coloring



The candle coloring feature allows the user to change the body color of the candles/bars when using candlesticks or bar charts. Three coloring modes are available, with two of them being based on the previously described signal methodologies.

Candle coloring also works on charts using Heikin-Ashi, Renko, Kagi, line break, point and figure, and range candles.

Each mode can be enabled from the settings in the **candle color mode** dropdown menu.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/candle-coloring/image547.png)

In order to use candle coloring as properly as possible make sure to disable the **borders** setting in your chart settings.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/candle-coloring/image72.png)

### Confirmation Simple

The **confirmation simple** color mode is based on the methodology used by confirmation signals and is the one enabled by default. This mode uses three colors, each one can be interpreted as follows:

* **Green candles:** Strong bullish signal active.
* **Red candles:** Strong bearish signal active.
* **Purple candles:** Normal bullish or bearish signal active.

![Confirmation Simple color mode](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/candle-coloring/image398.png)

<Tip>
  If you need to set an alert based on candle coloring or need to return information on what is the current candle color on an alert message simply use the **Bar Color Value** variable. This variable as three possible values each indicating the following:

  * 1: Candle color is green
  * 0: Candle color is purple
  * -1: Candle color is red

  This variable can be used as input for external indicators as well.
</Tip>

### Confirmation Gradient

The **confirmation gradient** color mode is also based on the algorithm that generates confirmation signals, but will slightly differ from the previously described **confirmation simple** color mode.

Lighter green colors indicate strong bullish variations, while lighter red colors indicate strong bearish variations. Colors closer to purple indicate that the current variation might be a retracement or that the market is ranging.

![Confirmation Gradient color mode](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/candle-coloring/image93.png)

### Contrarian Gradient

The **contrarian gradient** color mode is based on the contrarian signals algorithm. Stronger green colors indicate an oversold market and a potential reversal, while stronger red colors indicate an overbought market.

![Contrarian Gradient color mode](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/candle-coloring/contrarian.png)


# Dashboard
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/dashboard



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/image601.png)

The dashboard displays the most relevant metrics from within our premium features. This feature is extremely useful to easily obtain pertinent information regarding the market and can be used in confluence with confirmation or contrarian signals.

## Dashboard Elements

### Optimal Sensitivity

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/image576.png)

The optimal sensitivity is an estimate of the optimal **sensitivity** setting. Depending on the selected signal mode, the recommended sensitivity for confirmation or contrarian signals will be displayed. When **None** is selected, no optimal sensitivity will be displayed. This value is obtained through grid search optimization by using the most recent 250 bars and varies in a range between 10 and 20.

The cell color is based on the signal returned by the signal algorithm using the returned optimal setting, with a green color indicating a bullish signal and a red color indicating a bearish signal.

<Warning>
  Note that this metric is not indicative of future results.
</Warning>

When **Autopilot Sensitivity** is enabled, the recommended sensitivity will not appear on the dashboard and is replaced with an indication notifying the user that autopilot is enabled.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/image544.png)

### Trend Strength

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/image107.png)

The trend strength quantifies the strength of an underlying trend as a percentage and can inform the trader whether the market is trending or ranging. This indication can help a trader know whether a signal has a higher chance of being false or not. The 🔥 sign is used with trending markets while ❄️ is used for ranging markets.

The cell color is based on the currently displayed signal, with a green color indicating a bullish signal and a red color indicating a sell signal.

A trend strength plot is available allowing users to set alerts based on it, using placeholders `{{plot("Trend Strength"}}` in the alert message.

<Note>
  A percentage superior to 50% would indicate a trending market, while inferior percentages would indicate a ranging market.
</Note>

### Lux Volatility

The Lux volatility appearing on the dashboard is based on the **Lux Volatility** indicator and returns either **Stable** during periods of low volatility or **Volatile** during periods of high volatility. When volatility is rising the 📈 sign will appear, while 📉 appears when volatility is declining.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/image585.png)

The Lux volatility can also display with a warning sign, this happens when the volatility is either too low or too high and indicates extra precaution.

### Squeeze

Squeeze is a measure of price compression. Higher values of this metric indicate that the market is being compressed into a tighter area, suggesting market prices are subject to damping.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/squeeze.png)

Higher values of this metric are mostly returned during ranging markets.

### Volume Sentiment

The volume sentiment metric returns an estimate of whether most volume came from buying or selling participants. This measure is expressed as a percentage in the range \[-100 / 100].

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/volume.png)

The value of this metric can sometimes be high or low even if a candle does not reflect this sentiment, thus potentially indicating a reversal.

## Dashboard Settings

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/image591.png)

Enabling/disabling the dashboard can be done from the **Indicator Overlay** section. Settings affecting the dashboard visual style can be found in the **Advanced Settings** section.

### Dashboard Location

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/image610.png)

Determines the corner where the dashboard is displayed on the chart. Selecting "Hidden" will hide the dashboard.

### Dashboard Size

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/dashboard/image584.png)

Determines the size of the dashboard on the chart, options include **Tiny**, **Small**, **Normal**, and **Large**.


# Indicator Overlay
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/indicator-overlay



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/indicator-overlay/image634.png)

Signals & Overlays® Indicator allows the user to display various technical indicators directly on their chart. These can be used in confluence with the confirmation/contrarian signals or optionally used as a standalone.

Each overlay has an associated setting affecting its output. These settings range from 1 to 5, with higher values allowing the overlay to return indications for longer-term trends.

Each of the overlays is covered below.

## Smart Trail

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/indicator-overlay/smart.png)

The Smart Trail is a trailing stop that diverges from the price in the presence of unwanted price variations in a trend.

An up-trend is indicated when the price is above the trailing stop, and a down-trend when the price is below the trailing stop.

The smart trail also displays support (in blue) and resistance (in red) areas and aims to indicate when the price might reverse when entering the area.

## Reversal Zones

When enabled, one upper and one lower zone will be displayed on your chart, each zone is designed to help the user find tops and bottoms whether the market is ranging or trending (however the indicator will still be more effective during ranging markets).

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/indicator-overlay/reversal.png)

These zones can be great areas to take profit or find early entries to use alongside the confirmation or contrarian signals.

<Note>
  During periods of increased volatility, the price may move outside the zones, you can wait for the price to go back within each zone to take a decision.
</Note>

## Trend Tracer

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/indicator-overlay/tracer.png)

The Trend Tracer is a trend-following algorithm that aims to estimate the underlying trend in the price. When the indicator indicates an uptrend its color will be blue, while orange in the case of a downtrend.

<Note>
  The Trend Tracer can be used as a trailing support/resistance tool, you can also use it in confluence with the confirmation signals, either by waiting for the price to reach the trend tracer in order to enter a trade corresponding to the current confirmation signal or by filtering shorter-term signals by only trading those in accordance by the trend estimated by the trend tracer.
</Note>

## Trend Catcher

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/indicator-overlay/catcher.png)

The Trend Catcher is a similar algorithm to the previous **Trend Tracer**, however, it aims to detect very early trends, and is thus more reactive.

Like with the **Trend Tracer**, the color of the indicator determines the detected trend.

## Neo Cloud

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/indicator-overlay/neo.png)

When enabled, a simple cloud-like indicator will be displayed on your chart. The Neo Cloud is similar in effect to the Ichimoku Cloud, and can determine the current trend direction.

The cloud is filled with a gradient color showing how new a detected trend is, with brighter colors indicating older trends.

This cloud can provide a support when an uptrend is detected or resistance when a downtrend is detected. This makes it perfect for entries into precise trades.

    <ResponseField name="Invalidate On Any Repeated Step">
      The "Invalidate On Any Repeated Step" behavior allows to reset an incomplete sequence of conditions when a step is triggered such that it does not respect the user-set order of conditions.

      This behavior is useful when we want a perfectly ordered sequence of conditions to complete, without any step repeating itself.

      <Card title="Example">
        Let's take an example where we use 3 regular steps.

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Step 1">
            Step 1 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 2 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 2">
            Step 2 condition trigger, we will now evaluate step 3 from now on.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Step 1 or 2 Trigger">
            Step 1 or 2 conditions trigger, we start evaluating step 1 from now.
          </Step>
        </Steps>

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

Invalidation behaviors allows adding more restrictions to a sequence of conditions, users can use two different invalidation behaviors described below.

### Maximum Step Interval

<ResponseField name="Numerical Input" type="default:10" />

Maximum allowed horizontal distance (in bars) between two steps.

If the amount of bars since a step exceed the selected threshold, then the conditions sequence is reset, and we start evaluating from step 1 again.

### Highlight Custom Alert Triggers

<ResponseField name="Toggle" type="default:true" />

When a custom alert condition is set, a visual element is displayed at the bottom of the chart in order to more easily visualize when the custom alert conditions occurs (displayed by default).


# Signal Settings
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/signal-settings



The settings affecting the signal generation algorithm within Signals & overlays plays an important role in using the signals effectively. We give our users the possibility to adjust the settings so that the signals can fit their trading style but we also provide ways to easily adjust settings by using a wide variety of methods.

Each method for adjusting signal settings is designed to fit specific user needs, one method will not necessarily be more accurate than another.

<Warning>
  It's critical to understand Confirmation Signals are generally meant to be used as trend confirmations, not direct entries & exits. Focusing on ease of use with the signal settings & using other features within our toolkits will likely be the best decision for you rather than trying to find the "holy grail" of optimized signal settings & following the signals alone.
</Warning>

## Manual Adjustments

Manual adjustment of signals settings allow the user to fit the signals to their trading style and allows a greater degree of customizability.

### Confirmation Signals

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signal-settings/image565.png)

Confirmation signals are affected by the **Signals Sensitivity** setting. Increasing this setting will allow the trader to make decisions for longer-term trends.

### Method For Manually Adjusting Confirmation Signals

First, identify which price movements you are looking to trade (regardless of timeframes). Depending on how you are on your charts (on any timeframe) you can adjust the sensitivity value higher or lower to catch the price movements you are looking for. If you are looking for shorter term price movements on those timeframes, you should consider using a lower sensitivity. If you are looking for longer term price movements on those timeframes you should consider using a higher sensitivity.

### Contrarian Signals

Contrarian signals are also affected by the **Signals Sensitivity** setting, increasing it will aim to make contrarian signals spot longer term tops and bottoms.

## Automatic Settings Estimation

### Autopilot Signal Settings

The downside of adjusting signal settings is that this task needs to be constantly repeated due to ever-changing market conditions. **Autopilot** is a feature that allows the user to avoid adjusting signal settings completely. Instead, the currently selected signal generation algorithm (Confirmation or Contrarian) adjusts dynamically to the market conditions in order to provide the best signals possible.

This setting can be enabled from the **Advanced Settings** settings section.

<Note>
  Compared to other automatic methods the "Autopilot" feature is the most user-friendly since it avoids adjusting inputs within the indicator entirely.
</Note>

[](/public/images/lux-algo/signal-settings/autopilotfreq.png)

The **Autopilot Sensitivity** advanced setting allows autopilot to adjust to shorter or longer term trends depending on user preference.

### Dashboard Optimal Sensitivity

The Optimal Sensitivity is a value displayed on the Lux Dashboard showing the optimal **Sensitivity** setting when using Confirmation or Contrarian signal modes. This optimization is based on a grid search algorithm and as such will backtest every generated signals using a sensitivity ranging from 10 to 20 over the most recent 250 bars.

This feature works on any ticker & timeframe as long as at least 250 bars of historical data are available.

## Choosing The Right Method

While the optimal sensitivity provided by the dashboard is the most precise method since it's performing grid search, there is no "best" method for optimizing signals as it's up to the user to understand their style of trading and the price variations they want to trade (regardless of timeframes).

### Manual Adjustments

Do you specifically want to trade **shorter**-term trends on the timeframes you use?

* Consider using lower sensitivity values such as 5-10

Do you specifically want to trade **longer**-term trends on the timeframes you use?

* Consider using higher sensitivity values such as 20+

Alternatively, you can use the default of 12 for trading medium-term trends. This provides simple and responsive signals.

### Automatic Adjustments

Do you rely a lot on optimizing signals and are you ok with updating these manually over time?

* Use the Optimal Sensitivity provided by the dashboard to find more precise signal settings.

Do you completely dislike the process of adjusting signal settings altogether?

* Use the Autopilot sensitivity to allow the signals to adjust dynamically and work without the need of any user interaction.

<Note>
  Using Autopilot or the default settings are overall the simplest user experience as it allows you to completely avoid adjusting settings altogether.

# Signal Modes
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/signals



The Signals & Overlays® toolkit displays signals that can indicate the current trend direction in the price and aim to support the analysis of a trader. There are two main signal modes available, each one fitting a different trading style, **Confirmation** signals, and **Contrarian** signals. The following sections on this page describe these two methodologies in detail.

<Note>
  Focusing on using other features within our toolkit alongside the provided signals will likely be the best decision for you rather than using them alone.
</Note>

## Confirmation + Exits

![Confirmation Signals](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/image470.png)

Confirmation signals are based on a performance adaptive trend following methodology. As the name suggests, they aim to confirm any potential action a trader might take and are more effective when used in confluence with other features like our indicator overlays.

There are two types of Confirmation signals, **normal** signals, and **strong (+)** signals. Strong (+) signals are signals that are in accordance with the current estimated trend, while normal signals can be caused by a retracement.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/image316.png)

The Confirmation signals mode includes exit signals (represented by colored crosses). A bullish exit signal is displayed as a blue cross, while a bearish exit is displayed as an orange cross.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/image592.png)

These exits signals aim to help traders find areas to consider exiting a position based on a previous confirmation signal at the highest price possible. Also, note that these exits would always exit a previous confirmation signal on a win.

<Note>
  Successive exit signals can occur during longer-term trends, as such the user can do partial exits instead of exiting an entire position. These exit signals can also be used within a user's analysis as potential reversal points, as such they do not necessarily have to be used as take profits using the Signals & Overlays toolkit.
</Note>

## Contrarian + Exits

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/image607.png)

Contrarian signals by design go in opposition to the current trend and aim to deliver extremely fast decision timing. More simply put, Contrarian signals aim to spot potential tops and bottoms.

The advantage of Contrarian methodologies is that they are less subject to lag than most trend-following methodologies, thus allowing for potentially higher profits, however, it is important to note that going against the trend exposes a trader to larger price variations, which means potentially **higher losses**.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/image588.png)

Like Confirmation signals, some Contrarian signals can also be labeled as **strong (+)**. These strong signals occur when the price is excessively overbought or oversold and can have more of a chance of indicating a potential reversal.

<Note>
  Extra confluence such as declining volume or the occurrence of the signal near a significant support/resistance can be useful to tell when a signal is indicative of a reversal.

  You can also use the Contrarian signals more safely as an alternative exit point for a position. Timing tops/bottoms is very challenging, however, these can be useful for the natural reversal trader in combination with other features within the Signals & Overlays toolkit.
</Note>

The Contrarian signals mode also includes exit signals. A bullish exit signal is displayed as a blue cross, while a bearish exit is displayed as an orange cross.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/contrarian_exits.png)

Like Confirmation signals, Contrarian exit signals would always exit a previous confirmation signal on a win. Do note that successive exits will not occur for Contrarian signals.

<Tip>
  Contrarian Exits can be particularly useful for when price temporarily moves in accordance with a displayed Contrarian signal before reversing, rendering the signal as false for a larger trend reversal.

  If the user is confident that a larger reversal might still occur in accordance with a previously displayed Contrarian signal, the exit can be ignored or could lead to a partial exit only for a "scalp" trade.
</Tip>

## ML Classifier

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/classifier.png)

For users who want a deeper interpretation of signals, an adaptive threshold classifier is built-in to optionally enable at the top of the settings menu that automatically classifies both Confirmation & Contrarian signals between a range of 1 to 4 directly on the signal labels.

The displayed number indicates a degree of strength to your signals & can give user a deeper interpretation rather than just showing the base layer of normal vs strong. Do note the base layer of detecting normal vs strong trends is still displayed within the Confirmation Simple candle coloring mode which is on by default.

For Confirmation signals, lower-numbered signals (1-2) can be indicative of a potential reversal or retracement, while higher-numbered signals (3-4) can be more indicative of a trend continuation.

For Contrarian signals lower numbered signals can be indicative of an early trend with a lower chance of a larger reversal. Whereas higher numbers (3-4) will tend to occur on more developed trends, with a higher chance of larger trend reversal.

### ML Classifier Filter

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/classifier_settings.png)

Users can take their analysis even deeper by filtering out specific numbered signals from the advanced settings by entering the numbers that should stay on the chart. By default it shows "1234" as this would show all signals with the ML Classifier.

As an example, users could type into this box "12" to only display 1's and 2's on their chart. The same with "134" to only display 1's, 3's, and 4's on their chart depending on their preference for filtering specific signals.

## Display

It is possible to choose what type of signals you want to display here as well as displaying no signals at all, this is done from the settings menu in the **Signal Mode** drop-down menu.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/signals/image630.png)

By default, **Confirmation + Exits** is selected. **None** will not display any signal on the chart.

<Warning>
  Signals are confirmed at the opening of the next candle, if you see a signal displayed on the most recent candle remember that it might be subject to change.

# TP/SL Points
Source: https://docs.luxalgo.com/docs/toolkits/signals-overlays/tp-sl-points



![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/tp-sl/settings.png)

The TP/SL feature displays 4 take profits/stop losses levels and aims to help the user set stop losses and take profits by estimating points of potential support/resistance from an initial user-selected condition.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/tp-sl/tpsl.png)

Take-profits/stop-loss levels are based on the option selected in the "TP/SL Levels" dropdown menu. Options include the following:

| Option                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Signals`              | Will calculate new take-profits/stop-losses when a new confirmation or contrarian signal is detected. If the signal is bullish, take profits will be located above the price and stop losses below; if bearish, the opposite applies.                                            |
| `Smart Trail`          | Will calculate new take-profits/stop-losses when the Smart Trail turns bullish or bearish. If it turns bullish, take profits will be located above the price and stop losses below; if bearish, the opposite applies.                                                            |
| `Reversal Zones`       | Will calculate new take-profits/stop-losses when the price reach the outer bands of the reversal zones. If the price goes below the bottom zone, take profits will be located above the price and stop losses below; if the price goes above the top zone, the opposite applies. |
| `Trend Catcher`        | Will calculate new take-profits/stop-losses when the Trend Catcher turns bullish or bearish. If it turns bullish, take profits will be located above the price and stop losses below; if bearish, the opposite applies.                                                          |
| `Trend Tracer`         | Will calculate new take-profits/stop-losses when the Trend Tracer turns bullish or bearish. If it turns bullish, take profits will be located above the price and stop losses below; if bearish, the opposite applies.                                                           |
| `Neo Cloud`            | Will calculate new take-profits/stop-losses when the Neo Cloud turns bullish or bearish. If it turns bullish, take profits will be located above the price and stop losses below; if bearish, the opposite applies.                                                              |
| `Custom Alert Creator` | Will calculate new take-profits/stop-losses when the user-set custom alert creator condition is true.                                                                                                                                                                            |

When the price significantly deviates from the highest take profit or lowest stop loss, these will update, returning new relevant take profits and stop losses.

<Info>
  Users can notice when a tp/sl has updated based on where their levels start, if the levels start where the initial condition is located then it hasn't updated.
</Info>

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/luxalgo/public/images/lux-algo/tp-sl/tpsl_dist.png)

Users can control the distance between the price and the take profits/stop losses using the "Distance" setting, with higher values returning take profits/stop losses farther away from the price.

<Tip>
  Make sure to adjust this setting according to the price variations you are trading. If you are trading large price variations, use a higher setting value.
</Tip>

### Alerts

Users can be alerted when the price reaches a take profit or stop loss level using the "Take Profit" and/or "Stop Loss" "any alert() function call" conditions. This alert triggers once per bar.

#### TP/SL Placeholders

Plots for accessing take profits and stop losses levels are available in order for users to set alerts based on them.

Use the placeholder `{{plot("Take Profit")}}` for accessing the nearest take profit value and `{{plot("Stop Loss")}}` for accessing the nearest stop loss value.
