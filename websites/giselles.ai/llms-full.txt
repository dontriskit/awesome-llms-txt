# Nodes in Giselle
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/glossary/node

Learn about nodes, the building blocks of AI apps on Giselle. Connect nodes with various functions to visually design powerful AI workflows.

## Giselle’s AI Agents Can Be Built by Combining “Nodes”

Giselle is a platform that allows you to build powerful AI agents through an intuitive node-based interface. By connecting "nodes" with various functions, like assembling building blocks, you can visually design complex AI workflows. This makes it easy for anyone, even without specialized knowledge, to achieve automation with AI agents.

## Introducing Giselle's Key Nodes

Here are some of the fundamental nodes available in Giselle. By combining these nodes, you can build various AI workflows.

### Text Generator Node

Text Generator node calls a text generation model and generates text. By setting prompts and conditions, you can generate text tailored to your purpose. It can be used for various applications such as document creation, writing blog posts, and generating research reports. Giselle's text generation utilizes the LLM API, allowing for the generation of high-quality and natural-sounding text.

### Text Node

Text node is used to hold text data. It can be used to record prompts, instructions, annotations, and more. It helps manage and organize text data within the workflow, streamlining input to text generation nodes and data usage in other nodes.

### File Node

File node is used to handle file data. You can read files, use them as input for AI models, and save output results to files. It is useful for various tasks that involve utilizing file data, such as data-based analysis and report generation.

Currently, the File node supports reading PDF files. We plan to support a wider variety of file formats in the future.

## Future Node Expansion Plans

We plan to expand node functionality to further empower our users to build AI workflows. Here's a look at what our team is currently considering:

### Addition of New Nodes

* **Image Generation node:** We will add a node that generates images from text prompts. This will enable creative content creation and the building of AI workflows that utilize visual data.

### Expansion of the File Node

We plan to expand the file formats supported by the File node, adding support for:

* **Image Files** (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
* **Tabular Files** (CSV, Excel, etc.)
* **Audio Files**

### Integration of Web Search Functionality

* **Web Search:** We will add web search functionality to the existing Text Generator node.
  * For example, we aim to allow the direct use of the Gemini API's Grounding with Google Search feature from within a Giselle node.

Stay tuned for Giselle's product updates!

# Overview
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/prompts/overview

Prompt Engineering in Giselle’s Node-Based UI.

Prompt engineering involves crafting and refining prompts—structured instructions designed to guide AI models toward precise and high-quality outputs. Giselle enhances this practice through a rich node-based UI called Generator Nodes, enabling intuitive, visual, and efficient prompt construction.

## What is a Prompt in Giselle?

In Giselle, prompts are carefully structured instructions provided individually within each Generator Node through a rich text editor. Unlike conversational interfaces, Giselle primarily uses one-shot prompting, allowing each node to independently deliver precise instructions and receive AI-generated outputs tailored to specific tasks.

Each prompt typically includes:

* **Role Definition**: Specifies the AI model’s intended expertise or persona.
* **Task Instructions**: Clearly states the task the model needs to perform.
* **Context**: Provides relevant background information and supporting data.
* **Input Data**: Delivers specific information or data sources for processing.
* **Output Format**: Defines the required format and structure of the AI’s response.

## Why Effective Prompts Matter

Creating effective prompts in Giselle's Generator Nodes significantly enhances AI-driven workflows by:

* **Improving Output Quality**: Clearly articulated prompts result in accurate and relevant responses.
* **Minimizing Errors**: Reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings or incorrect outputs.
* **Ensuring Consistency**: Promotes uniformity and reliability in outputs, crucial for downstream tasks.
* **Optimizing Resources**: Well-crafted prompts reduce token consumption and processing time, enhancing cost efficiency.

## Leveraging Giselle’s Generator Nodes

Giselle’s Generator Nodes provide a robust platform for prompt engineering, allowing teams to:

* **Adjust Model Parameters**: Fine-tune various LLM settings to suit specific task requirements.
* **Integrate Diverse Data Sources**: Incorporate multiple data inputs and seamlessly manage them across nodes.
* **Share Data Between Nodes**: Reuse outputs generated in one node as inputs for subsequent nodes, enabling sophisticated workflow automation.
* **Visualize Workflows**: Clearly map out intellectual production processes for improved transparency, collaboration, and understanding within teams.

## Recommended Practices

To maximize the effectiveness of Giselle’s Generator Nodes, adhere to the following practices:

* **Clearly Define Roles**: Explicitly establish the AI’s expected perspective or expertise.
* **Write Precise Instructions**: Avoid ambiguity by providing clear, concise task descriptions.
* **Provide Relevant Context**: Supply comprehensive background information to enhance understanding.
* **Specify Structured Outputs**: Always include detailed output formatting to maintain consistency.
* **Iteratively Refine Prompts**: Regularly test and refine prompts within the node-based UI to continuously improve outputs.

Understanding the fundamentals of prompt engineering is crucial, as effectively designed prompts significantly influence the quality and reliability of AI-generated outputs.

# Tips
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/prompts/tips

Practical Tips for Effective Prompt Creation in Giselle’s Generator Nodes.

This document provides concrete, actionable tips tailored specifically for creating effective prompts within Giselle’s Generator Nodes. Unlike conversational UIs, Giselle uses a single-shot prompting model, meaning each prompt must be precise and complete on its own. While direct iterative refinement through conversation within a single node isn't possible, strategically chaining multiple nodes can significantly elevate the output quality through careful node integration and diverse data sourcing.

## Essential Principles

### 1. Ensure Clarity and Precision

* Clearly define the AI model’s role.
* Provide explicit, focused instructions without ambiguity.

```plaintext
❌ Poor example:
"Describe a useful invention."

✅ Good example:
"Role: Technology historian

Task: Provide a concise summary (100 words max) of the invention of the telephone, highlighting its historical significance and modern impact.

Output Format:
- Summary paragraph
- Clearly stated historical context and modern relevance"
```

### 2. Include Comprehensive Context

* Provide necessary background and purpose clearly in your prompt.
* Explicitly state constraints or expectations relevant to the task.

### 3. Specify Structured Outputs

* Clearly outline the desired response structure, length, and style.
* Define formats explicitly (e.g., bullet points, structured paragraphs, JSON, image dimensions).

## Advanced Node Integration Techniques

### 1. Effective Role Definition

Defining roles guides the AI to produce contextually accurate outputs:

```plaintext
✅ Example:
"Role: UX Designer

Task: Evaluate the provided web interface design for usability issues.

Output Format:
- List identified issues clearly
- Provide specific recommendations for improvements"
```

### 2. Sequential Node Chaining

Although Giselle nodes are single-shot, you can achieve iterative refinement by chaining multiple nodes:

1. **Ideation Node**: Generate initial ideas or concepts.
2. **Drafting Node**: Develop detailed drafts from initial concepts.
3. **Review Node**: Critically evaluate drafts and suggest improvements.

### 3. Leveraging Multi-Node Workflows

Combine diverse AI models across nodes to maximize output quality:

* **Perplexity Sonar** for research and fact verification.
* **Claude** for nuanced analysis and ethical considerations.
* **GPT-4o** for structured and creative content creation.
* **Fal AI** for high-quality image and visual content generation.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Overly Restrictive Instructions

Avoid excessively rigid constraints:

```plaintext
❌ Avoid:
"Create a detailed report exactly 200 words, including exactly four examples."
```

### 2. Contradictory or Confusing Instructions

Ensure instructions remain logically consistent:

```plaintext
❌ Avoid:
"Provide a highly detailed yet simple explanation using advanced terminology."
```

### 3. Ambiguous or Incomplete Prompts

Avoid vague instructions that lead to unclear outputs:

```plaintext
❌ Avoid:
"Explain something useful."
```

## Optimizing Giselle Workflows

### 1. Iterative Node Refinement

* Regularly review outputs from each node to optimize subsequent prompts.
* Use multiple nodes strategically to iteratively refine concepts, drafts, and final outputs.

### 2. Strategic Use of Templates

Leverage prompt templates for consistent, effective outputs:

```plaintext
✅ Giselle Template:

Role: [Defined AI role]

Task: [Explicit, precise task description]

Constraints:
- [Specific constraint or limitation]
- [Additional constraints as necessary]

Input Data:
- [Clearly referenced or provided data]

Output Format:
- [Detailed expected structure of response]
```

## Giselle-Specific Recommendations
