# Ad-to-Page Optimization
Source: https://docs.coframe.com/advanced-features/ad-to-page-optimization

Optimizing landing pages based on ad campaigns

Ad-to-Page Optimization aligns your landing page content with your ad campaigns, potentially improving conversion rates and lowering costs per click (CPC) due to higher relevance scores from platforms like Google Ads.

## Supported Platforms

* Google Ads (Beta)
* Facebook Ads (Alpha)

## How It Works

* **Dynamic Content Alignment**: Coframe automatically adjusts your landing page content to match the keywords or ad copy from your ad campaigns.
* **Increased Relevance**: By mirroring the messaging of your ads, visitors find a more cohesive experience, increasing the likelihood of conversion.
* **Quality Score Improvement**: Platforms like Google Ads reward relevant landing pages with better Quality Scores, potentially lowering your CPC.

## Setting Up Ad-to-Page Optimization for Google Ads (Beta)

### Prerequisites

* Active Google Ads campaigns
* Coframe script installed on your landing pages

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect Your Google Account**
   * In your Coframe dashboard, navigate to the Ad-to-Page Optimization section.
   * Click on "Connect Google Ads Account" and follow the authentication process.

2. **Select Campaign and Ad Group**
   * You'll see a table with all campaigns in your account.
   * Search or click on a campaign to view its ad groups.
   * Select the desired ad group.

3. **Choose Optimization Type**
   * Select either "Keywords" or "Ads" for alignment.

4. **For Keyword-based Optimization:**

## Setting Up Ad-to-Page Optimization for Facebook Ads (Alpha)

The process for Facebook Ads is similar to Google Ads, following the Facebook structure:

1. Connect your Facebook Ads account.
2. Select Campaign > Ad Set > Ad.
3. The system will align the page based on the selected ad, passing the ad creative into the context of the optimizer.

## Best Practices

* **Consistent Messaging**: Ensure that the language and tone of the landing page match that of the ads.
* **Keyword Insertion**: Use dynamic keyword insertion carefully to maintain readability and coherence.
* **Compliance**: Verify that dynamic content complies with advertising policies and regulations.

## Coming Soon

* Optimization at the ad group and campaign levels for Google Ads.

</video>

> **Coffee** caffeinates your frontend development workflow with AI. This project is intended to be more than just a nice demo but rather an ergonomic tool that can write and interact with production-quality code.

**Featured on [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/Coframe/coffee)!**

## Features

* Works with any React codebase including Next.js, Remix, etc.
* Reliable enough for most standard UI components.
* Supports most simple prop types (data, callbacks, etc).
* Uses the same DX for both editing existing components and creating new components from scratch.
* Generates clean, maintainable code.
* This is where the future of AI-assisted code generation is headed! 🚀

## Try It

No dependencies, no setup.

Just run your React web app normally, and then open another shell in the same directory and run:

```bash
docker run --pull=always -it -e OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY} -v $(pwd):/mount coframe/coffee:latest
```

You can also build the image yourself from the `/react` directory:

```bash
./dev.sh build
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key ./dev.sh ../path/to/your/frontend/repo
```

Keep an eye on the terminal running the Docker container to see what Coffee is up to. It's fun to see the code being generated!

## How It Works

Coffee uses Docker to ensure any agentic code it runs is fully isolated. It's implemented in Python, but you don't need to touch Python to use Coffee. The code-generation agent is relatively simple.

When you run Coffee, it listens for changes to `js/jsx/ts/tsx` files in your source directory. If it detects a `<Coffee>` JSX component, it will kick off its magic!

```jsx
<Coffee parameter={parameter}>
  Here is where you put your prompt that Coffee will use to generate the first
  version of your desired component.

  This is the same type of prompt that you'd use with any LLM like ChatGPT, so
  feel free to get creative and apply your favorite prompt engineering tricks.

  Finally, you can also pass in any parameters you want from your parent component
  by simply adding them as demonstrated above.
</Coffee>
```

Every time you save your source file, Coffee checks for any `<Coffee>` components that need brewing. It passes your parent component code, any existing child component code, your prompt, and any custom configuration to the OpenAI chat completions API to generate a new version of the target component.

> ℹ️ Your application may display an error immediately after saving it the first time, as the Coffee component has not been written yet. This is normal and will resolve once the Coffee agent has brewed the component.

Iterating on a component after it has been brewed is just as easy:

```jsx
<Coffee parameter={parameter}>
  To edit and update the brewed component, replace the prompt with
  your desired changes. For instance, "make the button background darker".
</Coffee>
```

The brewing process is currently a little slow, but we're working on ways to make it significantly faster.

Finally, once you're happy with your brewed component, you can add a `pour="ComponentName.tsx"` prop to your `<Coffee>` component. Save the file, and it will automatically replace the `<Coffee>` component with the generated component.

```tsx
export function Example() {
  return (
    <Coffee
      title="Click Me"
      onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}
      pour="MyButton.tsx"
    >
      Your prompt here
    </Coffee>
  )
}
```

When you save this file, Coffee will replace the code with:

```tsx
import MyButton from './MyButton'

export function Example() {
  return (
    <MyButton title='Click Me' onClick={() => console.log('clicked')} />
  )
}
```

Now you have a fully functional, reusable React component that's ready for production.

**The coolest part of Coffee is that you can edit existing React components just as easily as creating new ones.**

Suppose you want to edit the `MyButton` component. Just add the `coffee="description of change"` prop:

```tsx
export function Example() {
  return (
    <MyButton title='Click Me' onClick={() => console.log('clicked')} coffee="make the button color blue" />
  )
}
```

After saving, Coffee detects this "caffeinated" component and updates it for you.

You can keep iterating like this indefinitely—you can never run out of Coffee! 😂 Once you're satisfied, remove the `coffee` prop.

# Optimizer Methodology
Source: https://docs.coframe.com/optimization/optimizer-methodology

Understanding Coframe's Optimizer Algorithm

Coframe utilizes a modified Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithm to dynamically optimize website content. This advanced algorithm enhances traditional MAB strategies by continuously evolving variants based on performance, ensuring adaptability to user behavior over time.

### Key Enhancements

1. **Maintaining an Adaptive Holdout Baseline**: A control variant is retained for to estimate the baseline performance, its traffic allocation is gradually reduced to a minimum level.
2. **Dropping Underperforming Arms**: Variants that consistently underperform are removed based on their allocations which is proportional to the belief of their performance.
3. **Intelligent Variant Generation**: Our AI models generate new variants by analyzing and incorporating insights from ongoing experimental data.
4. **Incubation Period for New Arms**: New variants are given a protection period to gather sufficient data before being evaluated for potential removal.

## Standard Multi-Armed Bandit Overview

In the classical MAB problem, an agent selects among $K$ arms (variants), each with an unknown reward distribution. The objective is to maximize the cumulative reward over time by balancing exploration (trying out less-known arms) and exploitation (selecting the best-known arms).

### Mathematical Formulation

* **Arms**: $\mathcal{A} = \{1, 2, \dots, K\}$
* **At each time $t$**:
  * Select an arm $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$.
  * Receive a reward $r_t$ drawn from the probability distribution associated with $a_t$.

The agent aims to minimize **regret** $R(T)$, defined as:

$$
R(T) = T \mu^* - \sum_{t=1}^T r_t
$$

where $\mu^*$ is the expected reward of the optimal arm.

In the context of website optimization, regret is closely tied to conversion rate. The regret represents the difference between the cumulative reward (conversions) obtained by always choosing the optimal arm and the actual cumulative reward obtained by the algorithm. A lower regret implies that the algorithm is performing closer to the optimal strategy, which in turn means it's achieving a higher overall conversion rate. By minimizing regret, the algorithm effectively maximizes the conversion rate over time.

## Coframe's Approach

### Algorithm Steps

#### Initialization

* **Initial Set of Arms**: $\mathcal{A} = \{0, 1, 2, \dots, K\}$, where $0$ represents the baseline or control variant.
* **Initial Traffic Allocation**: Distribute traffic equally among all arms, i.e., each arm receives $\frac{1}{K+1}$ of the traffic.
* **Initial Belief**: For each arm, we initialize its belief with the same prior.
* **Iteration Start**: The algorithm begins its iterations, with each iteration representing a one-hour time period.

#### At Each Time Step $t$ (Hourly Iteration)

1. **Arm Selection**:
   * Use a selection policy (Thompson Sampling) to choose an arm $a_t$.
2. **Reward Observation**:
   * Observe reward $r_t$ ($r_t = 1$ if a conversion occurs, $r_t = 0$ otherwise).
3. **Parameter Update**:
   * Update the success ($S_i$) and failure ($F_i$) counts for arm $a_t$.

**Note on Experimental Unit**: Our experimental unit is "unique visitor hours". Within each one-hour iteration, exposures are deduplicated by visitor using a cookie. This means that the same person within the same iteration will see the same variant/arm, ensuring consistency in the user experience and data collection.

#### Dropping Underperforming Arms

* **Criteria for Dropping**:
  * An arm is considered for removal if its traffic allocation falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 2%) and its incubation period has elapsed.
* **Rationale**:
  * This allows for the addition of new variants to replace underperforming

#### Introducing New Arms

* **Generation**:
  * New variants are continuously generated by our AI models and can be added to an ongoing MAB when other variants are dropped.
* **Conditioning Factors**:
  * Historical rewards $\{ r_i \}$
  * Content features $\{ v_i \}$
  * The model leverages this information to produce variants with a higher expected reward.

#### Traffic Reallocation

* **Adjust Traffic Allocation**:
  * Traffic allocation for each variant is automatically adjusted every iteration.

### Selection Policy: Thompson Sampling

Thompson Sampling is used for its effective balance between exploration and exploitation.

#### Posterior Sampling

For each arm $i$:

* **Successes**: $S_i$
* **Failures**: $F_i$
* **Beta Distribution**: Sample $\theta_i \sim \text{Beta}(S_i + alpha_0, F_i + \beta_0)$
* **Arm Selection**: Choose arm $a_t$ by sampling from all arms and selecting the arm associated to the maximum value
  * Batch processing: We process observations in batches and sample from the posterior distribution after all the observations in one iteration have been accounted for.

### Traffic Allocation Constraints

* **Minimum Allocation for Holdout Baseline**:
  * Ensure the holdout baseline arm $a_0$ retains at least a fraction $\alpha$ of the traffic (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$).

## Advantages Over Standard MAB

1. **Continuous Evolution**: New variants are regularly introduced, keeping content fresh and aligned with user preferences.
2. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Underperforming variants are removed, reallocating resources to better-performing ones.
3. **Accelerated Optimization**: AI-generated variants, informed by past performance, may lead to higher rewards more quickly.
4. **Robust Benchmarking**: Maintaining a constant baseline variant allows for consistent performance tracking over time.

## Mathematical Details

### Reward Estimation

For each arm $i$:

* **Estimated Conversion Rate**:

$$
\hat{\mu}_i = \frac{S_i}{n_i}
$$

where $n_i = S_i + F_i$ is the total number of times arm $i$ has been selected.

* **Credibility Intervals**:

Use Bayesian methods to estimate the credibility interval for $\hat{\mu}_i$. This provides a probabilistic range of plausible values for the true conversion rate, given the observed data and prior beliefs.

For each arm $i$, we can calculate the posterior distribution:

$$
P(\mu_i | \text{data}) \propto P(\text{data} | \mu_i) \cdot P(\mu_i)
$$

where $P(\mu_i)$ is the prior distribution and $P(\text{data} | \mu_i)$ is the likelihood.

The 95% credibility interval can then be derived from the posterior distribution, representing the range within which we believe the true conversion rate lies with 95% probability.

### Dropping Criterion Justification

* **Statistical Significance**:

Ensure that enough data has been collected (e.g., minimum sample size $n_{\text{min}}$) before considering an arm for removal.

* **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**:

By allowing an incubation period, the algorithm balances the need to explore new variants with the need to exploit known good performers.

### AI-Conditioned Variant Generation

* **Objective**:

Generate a new variant $v_{\text{new}}$ expected to have a higher reward than the average of the dropped arms.

* **Model Inputs**:

  * Features of previous variants $\{ v_i \}$
  * Performance metrics $\{ \hat{\mu}_i \}$

* **Model Output**:

  * A new variant $v_{\text{new}}$ predicted to perform better.

* **Expected Reward of New Variant**:

  The expected reward of the new variant is:

  $$
  \mu_{\text{new}} = \mathbb{E}\left[ r_{\text{new}} \mid v_{\text{new}} \right]
  $$

  Our goal is for $\mu_{\text{new}} > \hat{\mu}_{\text{avg}}$, where $\hat{\mu}_{\text{avg}}$ is the average performance of previous arms.

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Sufficiency

* **Warm-Up Period**:

  Allow new arms to collect sufficient data before making decisions about their performance.

### Exploration-Exploitation Balance

* **Adaptive Parameters**:

  Adjust parameters like the minimum allocation and incubation period based on traffic patterns and performance.

## Comparison with Standard MAB

| Aspect                   | Standard MAB                     | Coframe's Modified MAB                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Arm Pool                 | Fixed                            | Dynamic (arms can be added/dropped)       |
| Underperforming Arms     | Continue to receive some traffic | Dropped when below performance thresholds |
| New Variant Introduction | Not typically included           | Introduces new arms via AI conditioning   |
| Baseline Variant         | Not necessarily maintained       | Constant holdout baseline is maintained   |
| Adaptability             | Limited to initial arm set       | Continuously adapts with new variants     |

## Practical Example

Assume we start with:

* **Holdout Baseline**: $v_0$
* **Initial Variants**: $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$

### Process Flow

1. **Initialization**:

   * Equal traffic allocation: each variant receives 25% of traffic.

2. **Data Collection**:

   * Collect rewards over time for each variant.

3. **Evaluation**:

   * After sufficient data, suppose $v_2$ falls below the 2% allocation threshold.

4. **Dropping Underperformer**:

   * Drop $v_2$ from the active arm set.

5. **Variant Generation**:

   * Generate a new variant $v_{\text{new}}$ conditioned on past variants and their performance.

6. **Reallocation**:

   * Redistribute traffic among $v_0$, $v_1$, $v_3$, and $v_{\text{new}}$.

7. **Iteration**:

   * Repeat the process, continuously refining the variant pool.

## Conclusion

Coframe's modified multi-armed bandit algorithm offers a robust and efficient method for website content optimization by:

* **Leveraging Past Performance**: AI-generated variants are informed by historical data, increasing the likelihood of success.
* **Dynamic Adaptation**: The ability to drop and introduce arms keeps the optimization process responsive to changing user behaviors.
* **Maintaining a Baseline**: A constant control variant ensures that performance improvements are measured accurately.

# Segmentation
Source: https://docs.coframe.com/optimization/segmentation

Creating and Managing Audience Segments in Coframe

Audience segmentation in Coframe empowers you to tailor your optimization strategies to specific groups of visitors based on attributes like location, device type, and more. By delivering personalized experiences, you can enhance user engagement and boost conversion rates.

## Understanding Audience Segments

* **Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE)**: In Coframe, audience segments are designed to be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. This means each visitor will fall into one—and only one—segment, ensuring clear and accurate data analysis across your optimizers.

* **Single-Dimension Segmentation**: Currently, Coframe supports segmentation on one dimension per page. For example, you can segment by location **or** by device type, but not both simultaneously. This approach simplifies management and keeps the user experience streamlined.

## How to Create a Segment

Creating a new audience segment is straightforward and can be done directly from the editor.

1. **Access the Editor**: Navigate to the page you wish to segment and open the **Editor**.

2. **Open Segment Dropdown**: In the top-left corner of the editor, you'll see a dropdown menu for audience segments.

3. **Create a New Segment**:

   * Click on **"+ Create New"** to open the segment creation modal.
     ![Creating a New Segment](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/coframe/public/audience-segment.png)
   * In the modal, define your segment by selecting attributes such as location, device type, browser, etc.

4. **Define Segment Criteria**:

   * **Select Attributes**: Choose the criteria that define your segment. For example, select **Location** and specify **United States**.
   * **Set Conditions**: You can set conditions like "equals," "does not equal," "contains," etc., to fine-tune your segment.

5. **Save the Segment**: After configuring your segment, click **"Save"** to add it to your list of audience segments.

The variants you set up for this optimizer will now be optimized for this segment.

For a list of supported attributes, refer to [Editor: Audience Segments](/editor/audience-segments).

## Managing Your Segments

You can view and manage all your audience segments from the **Audiences** tab in the dashboard.

* **Access Audiences Tab**: Find the **Audiences** tab located at the bottom left of the dashboard.

* **View Segments**: This section displays all the audience segments you've created.

* **Edit Segments**:

  * Click on a segment to modify its criteria.
  * Update attributes or conditions as needed.

* **Delete Segments**:

  * Remove segments that are no longer relevant.
  * **Note**: Deleting a segment will also remove its associated optimizer and data.

## Important Considerations

* **New Optimizer Creation**: Each time you create an audience segment, Coframe automatically creates a new optimizer for that segment on the page.

* **MECE Principle**: Segments are designed to be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive to prevent overlap and ensure that every visitor is accounted for in your analytics.

* **Single-Dimension Limitation**: Currently, you can only segment on one dimension per page to maintain simplicity and avoid complexity in the user interface.

## Advanced Segmentation for Enterprises

If you need to segment your audience on multiple dimensions simultaneously (e.g., by both location and device type), we offer advanced segmentation features for enterprise clients.

* **Custom Configuration**: We can enable multi-dimensional segmentation tailored to your requirements.

* **Contact Us**: Please [reach out to us](https://cal.com/coframe/contact-sales) to discuss how we can support your advanced segmentation needs.

## Benefits of Audience Segmentation

* **Personalized Experiences**: Deliver content and optimizations that resonate with specific audience groups.

* **Improved Conversion Rates**: Targeted messaging can lead to higher engagement and conversion rates.

* **Enhanced Insights**: Gain deeper understanding of how different segments interact with your site, informing future strategies.

## Minimal Impact on Load Times

We measure the performance on many pages where Coframe is deployed, both before and after integration. Our findings show that there's minimal practical impact on performance. We achieve this through:

* **Optimized Edge Content Delivery**: Our content is optimized at the edge, reducing latency and ensuring fast delivery to users worldwide.
* **Efficient Payloads**: We've minimized our payload sizes and made clever optimizations to reduce the amount of data transferred.

## Flexible Integration Options

We offer multiple integration methods to suit your needs:

* **Frontend Integration**: The standard method involves adding our JavaScript snippet to your website. This is quick to set up and requires minimal changes to your existing codebase.
* **Backend Integration**: For deeper integration, we offer options to integrate at the CMS or server-side level. This can further reduce any potential performance overhead by processing optimizations before the page is sent to the user.

## Continuous Performance Monitoring

We continuously monitor performance metrics to ensure that our optimizations do not negatively impact your website's speed. Our team is committed to ongoing improvements and addressing any issues promptly.
