# Create a message analytic event
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/apis/autocompose/create-a-message-analytic-event

api-specs/autocompose.yaml post /autocompose/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/message-analytic-events
To improve the performance of ASAPP suggestions, provide information about the actions performed by the agent while composing a message by creating `message-analytic-events`.

These analytic events indicate which AutoCompose functionality was used or not. This information along with the conversation itself is used to optimize our models, resulting in better results for the agents.

We track the following types of message analytic events:
- suggestion-1-inserted: The agent selected the first of the `suggestions` from a `Suggestion` API response.
- suggestion-2-inserted: The agent selected the second of the `suggestions` from a `Suggestion` API response.
- suggestion-3-inserted: The agent selected the third of the `suggestions` from a `Suggestion` API response.
- phrase-completion-accepted: The agent selected the `phraseCompletion` from a `Suggestion` API response.
- spellcheck-applied: A correction provided in a `SpellcheckCorrection` API response was applied automatically.
- spellcheck-undone: A correction provided in a `SpellcheckCorrection` API response was undone by clicking the undo button.
- custom-response-drawer-inserted: The agent inserted one of their custom responses from the custom response drawer.
- custom-panel-inserted: The agent inserted a response from their custom response list in the custom response panel.
- global-panel-inserted: The agent inserted a response from the global response list in the global response panel.

Some of the event types have a corresponding event object to provide details.

# Overview
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/apis/overview

Overview of the ASAPP API

The ASAPP API is Resource oriented, relying on REST principles. Our APIs accept and respond with JSON.

## Authentication

The ASAPP API uses a combination of an API Id and API Secret to authenticate requests.

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
```

Learn how to find your API Id and API Secret in the [Developer quickstart](/getting-started/developers).

## Environments

The ASAPP API is available in two environments:

* **Sandbox**: Use the Sandbox environment for development and testing.
* **Production**: Use the Production environment for production use.

Use the API domain to make requests to the relevant environment.

| Environment | API Domain                                                     |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sandbox     | [https://api.sandbox.asapp.com](https://api.sandbox.asapp.com) |
| Production  | [https://api.asapp.com](https://api.asapp.com)                 |

## Errors

The ASAPP API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

| Status Code | Description           |
| :---------- | :-------------------- |
| 200         | OK                    |
| 201         | Created               |
| 204         | No Content            |
| 400         | Bad Request           |
| 401         | Unauthorized          |
| 403         | Forbidden             |
| 404         | Not Found             |
| 429         | Too Many Requests     |
| 500         | Internal Server Error |

We also return a `code` and `message` in the response body for each error. Learn more about error codes in the [Error handling](/getting-started/developers/error-handling) section.

| **Phrase autocomplete**  | Provides in-line phrase suggestions that appear while an agent is typing                                                  |
| **Response quicksearch** | Allows in-line search of global and custom responses                                                                      |
| **Fluency correction**   | Applies automatic grammar corrections that an agent can undo                                                              |
| **Profanity blocking**   | Prevents an agent from sending a message containing profanity to the customer                                             |
| **Custom response list** | Enables management of an individual agent's custom responses in a simple library interface                                |
| **Global response list** | Enables management of global responses in a simple tooling interface                                                      |

## How it works

AutoCompose takes in a live feed of your agent's conversations, and then using our various AI models, returns a list of changes or suggested responses based on the state of conversation and currently typed message.

1. Provide Conversation data via Conversation API.
2. In your Agent Application, call the AutoCompose APIs to retrieve the list of changes or suggested responses.
3. Show the potential changes or responses to your Agent for them to incorporate.

This streamlines your agent's efficiency while still allowing agents to review changes, ensuring only the highest quality of responses are sent to your customers.

AutoCompose has the following technical components:

| Component              | Description                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autosuggest model**  | LLM Retrained by ASAPP with agent usage data                                                                                         |
| **Data Storage**       | A storage for historical conversations, global response lists and agent historical feature usage that are used for weekly retraining |

ASAPP AutoSummary is a recommended pairing with AutoCompose, generating conversation summaries of key events for 100% of customer interactions.

Note-taking and disposition questions take call time and agent focus, both of which can have a negative impact on agent performance. Removing summarization tasks from agents through automation can keep agents focused on messaging with customers and yield higher summary data coverage than manual agent notes.

Learn how to use the AutoCompose tooling UI

## Overview

This page outlines how to manage and configure global response lists for AutoCompose in ASAPP Messaging.

The global response list is created and maintained by program administrators, and the responses contained within it can be suggested to the full agent population.

<Note>
  Suggestions given to agents can also include custom responses created by agents and organic responses, which are a personalized response list of frequently-used responses by each agent.

  To learn more about AutoCompose Features, go to [AutoCompose Product Guide](/autocompose/product-guide).
</Note>

ASAPP Messaging gives program administrators full control over the global response list.

In ASAPP Messaging, click on **AutoCompose** and then on **Global Responses** in the sidebar.

## Best Practices

The machine learning models powering AutoCompose look at the global response list and select the response that is most likely to be said by the agent.

To create an effective global response list, take into account the following best practices:

1. We recommend having a global response list containing 1000-5000 responses.
   * The more global responses, the better. Having responses that cover the full range of common conversational scenarios enables the models to make better selections.
   * Deploying a small response list that contains only one way of saying each phrase is not recommended. The best practice is to include several ways of saying the same phrase, as that will enable our machine learning models to match each agent's conversational style.
   * Typically, the list is generated by collecting and curating the most frequent agent messages from historical chats at the beginning of an ASAPP deployment.
2. Responses should be kept up-to-date as there are changes to business logic and policies to avoid suggestions with stale information.

## Managing Responses

The Global Responses page contains a table where each row represents a response that can be suggested to an agent.

There are two ways of managing the global response list:

1. Directly add or edit responses through the AI-Console UI, which provides a simple and intuitive experience. This method is best suited for small volumes of changes.
2. Upload a .csv file containing the entire global response list, doing a bulk edit. This method is best suited for large volumes of changes.

The following table describes the elements that can be included with each response:

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         | Required |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| Text             | The text field contains the response that can be suggested to an agent. Optionally, the text can include [metadata inserts](#metadata "Metadata") to dynamically embed information into a response. | Yes      |
| Title            | Used to provide short descriptors for responses. If a title is specified, when a response is suggested to an agent it will display its title.                                                       | No       |
| Metadata filters | Used to determine when a response can appear as a suggestion. Allows responses to be filtered to specific agents based on one or more conditions (e.g. filtering responses to specific queues).     | No       |
| Folder path      | Used to organize responses into folder hierarchies. Agents can access and navigate these folders to discover relevant responses.                                                                    | No       |

## Uploading Responses in Bulk

The global response list can be updated by uploading a .csv file containing the full response list. The recommended workflow is to first download the most recent response list, make changes, and upload the list back into AI-Console.

### .csv Templates

The following instructions provide detailed descriptions of how responses need to be defined when using a .csv file.

**Text**

The text field should contain the exact response that will be suggested to an agent. Optionally, the text field may contain metadata inserts. To use a metadata insert within a response, type the key of the metadata insert inside curly brackets:

> "Hello, my name is \{rep\_name}. How may I assist you today?"

To learn more about which metadata inserts are available to use within responses, see [Metadata](#metadata "Metadata").

**Folder path**

Responses can be organized within a folder structure. This field can contain a single folder name, or a series of nested folders. If using nested folders, each folder should be separated by the ">" character (e.g. "PARENT FOLDER > CHILD FOLDER").

**Title**

The title field enables short descriptions for responses. Titles do not need to be unique.

**Metadata filters**

Metadata filters can be added by specifying conditions using the metadata filter key and metadata filter value columns.

Key: The metadata filter key contains the field on which to condition the response.

For example, if we want to filter a response to a specific queue, the metadata key should be "queue\_name".

Value: The metadata filter value specifies for which values of the metadata key the response will be valid.

A single metadata filter key can have multiple values, which should be written as a comma-separated list. For example, if the response should be available to the "general" and "escalation" queues, then the metadata filter value should be "general, escalation".

A response can contain multiple conditions. To define multiple conditions, separate each with a new line; use shift+enter in Windows or option+enter in Mac to enter a new line in the same cell.

</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Getting the "invalid character �" when uploading a response list?**
  If you are uploading a response list and seeing an error message that a response contains the invalid character �, it is likely caused by using Microsoft Excel to edit the response list, as Excel uses a non-standard encoding mechanism. To fix this issue, select **Save as...** and under **File Format**, select **CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (.csv)**.
</Tip>

## Saving and Deploying

Saving changes to the global response list or uploading a new list from a .csv file will create a new version. Past versions can be seen by selecting **Past Versions** under the vertical ellipses menu.

The global response list can be easily deployed into testing or production environments. An indicator at the top of each version indicates the status of the response list: unsaved draft, saved draft, deployed in a testing environment, or deployed in production.

## Metadata

The Metadata Dictionary, accessible through the navigation panel, provides an overview of metadata that is available for your organization to use in global responses. There are two types of metadata:

* **Metadata inserts** are used within the text of each response as templates that can dynamically insert information. Inserts are defined using curly brackets (e.g. Hello, this is \{rep\_name}, how may I assist you today?).
* **Metadata filters** introduce conditions to control in which conversations responses can be suggested. By default, responses without any metadata filters are available as suggestions for the entire agent population. Common patterns for filtering include restricting responses to specific queues or lines of business.

<Note>
  The metadata on global responses doesn’t control visibility or access for agents in the Global Responses tab of the Right-Hand Panel. The metadata implementation, will influence when a response is suggested by the model in the AutoCompose functionality.
</Note>

</Frame>

### Metadata Inserts

A response that contains a metadata insert is a templated response. When a templated response is suggested, it will be shown to the agent with the metadata insert filled in.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-99f92559-38ad-54a6-e764-58f659ae2df0.png" />

</Frame>

*Templated response being suggested to the agent in AutoCompose*

<Note>
  If the needed metadata insert (such as customer or agent name) is unavailable for a particular response (e.g. the customer in the conversation is unidentifiable), the response will not be suggested by AutoCompose.
</Note>

To view all metadata inserts available to use within a conversation, navigate to **Metadata Dictionary** in the navigation panel.

### Metadata Filters

Responses that do not have associated metadata filters will be available to the full agent population. In the metadata dictionary, click on any metadata filter to view details about the filter and all possible values available for it.


# Deploying AutoCompose API
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autocompose/deploying-autocompose-api

Communicate with AutoCompose via API.

ASAPP AutoCompose has the following technical components:

* **An autosuggest model** that ASAPP retrains weekly with [agent usage data you provide through the `/analytics/message-sent` endpoint](#sending-agent-usage-data "Sending Agent Usage Data")
* **Data storage** for historical conversations, global response lists and agent historical feature usage that are used for weekly retraining
* The **Conversation API** for creating and updating conversation data and the **AutoCompose API** that interfaces with the application with which agents interact and receives agent usage data in the form of message analytics events

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-efcbb75b-b38e-3cc1-4f44-1630dbe3c68b.png" />
</Frame>

### Setup

ASAPP provides an AI Services [Developer Portal](/getting-started/developers). Within the portal, developers can do the following:

* Access relevant API documentation (e.g. OpenAPI reference schemas)
* Access API keys for authorization
* Manage user accounts and apps

In order to use ASAPP's APIs, all apps must be registered through the portal. Once registered, each app will be provided unique API keys for ongoing use.

<Tip>
  Visit the [Get Started](/getting-started/developers) page on the Developer Portal for instructions on creating a developer account, managing teams and apps, and setup for using AI Service APIs.
</Tip>

## Usage

ASAPP AutoCompose exposes API endpoints that each enable distinct features in the course of an agent's message composition workflow. Requests should be sent to each endpoint based on events in the conversation and actions taken by the agent in their interface.

For example, the sequence below shows requests made for a typical new conversation in which the agent begins creating their first message, sends the first message and receives one message in return from an end-customer:

<Note>
  This example is not comprehensive of every possible endpoint request supported by AutoCompose. Refer to the [Endpoints](#endpoints-25843 "Endpoints") section for a full listing of endpoints.

### Conversations API

ASAPP receives conversations through POST requests to the Conversations API. This service creates a record of conversations referenced as a source of truth by all ASAPP services.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-807868bf-ee29-0cb8-4cc9-e97fabf3a8f8.png" />
</Frame>

By promptly sending conversation and message data to this API, you ensure that ASAPP's conversation records match your own and that ASAPP services use the most current information available.

[`POST /conversation/v1/conversations`](/apis/conversations/create-or-update-a-conversation)

Use this endpoint to create a new conversation record or update an existing conversation record.

**When to Call**

This service should be called when a conversation starts or when something about the conversation changes (e.g. a conversation is reassigned to a different agent).

**Request Details**

Requests must include a conversation identifier from your system of record (external to ASAPP) and a timestamp (formatted in RFC3339 micro second date-time expressed in UTC) for when the conversation started.

Requests to create a conversation record must also include identifying information about the human participants. Two types of requests are supported to create a new conversation:

1. **Conversations started with an agent:** Provide both the `agent` and `customer` objects in the request when the conversation begins.
2. **Conversations started with a virtual agent:** Provide only the `customer` object in the initial request when the conversation with the virtual agent begins; you must send a subsequent request that includes both the `agent` and `customer` objects once the agent joins the conversation.

Requests may also include key-value pair metadata for the conversation that can be used either (1) to insert values into templated responses for agents or (2) as filter criteria to determine whether a conversation is eligible for specific response suggestions.

<Note>
  To support inserting the customer's time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) into templated agent responses, conversation metadata key-value pairs should take the format of `CUSTOMER_TIMEZONE: <IANA time zone name>`
</Note>

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with a unique ASAPP identifier (`id`) for the conversation. This identifier should be used whenever referencing this conversation in the future. For example, adding new messages to this conversation record will require use of this identifier so that ASAPP knows to which conversation messages should be added.

[`POST /conversation/v1/conversations/\{conversationId\}/messages`](/apis/messages/create-a-message)

Use this endpoint to add a message to an existing conversation record.

**When to Call**

This service should be called after each sent message by a participant in the conversation.

<Note>
  If a conversation begins with messages between a customer and virtual agent/bot, ensure the conversation record is updated once the agent joins the conversation, prior to posting messages to this endpoint for the agent.
</Note>

**Request Details**

The path parameter for this request is the unique ASAPP conversation ID that was provided in the response body when the conversation record was initially created.
Requests must include the message's text and the message's sent timestamp (formatted in RFC3339 micro second date-time expressed in UTC).
Requests must also include identifying information about the sender of the message, including their `role`; supported values include `agent`, `customer`, or `system` for virtual agent messages.

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with a unique ASAPP identifier (`id`) for the message. This identifier should be used if a need arises to reference this message in the future.

<Note>
  When a conversation message is posted, ASAPP applies redaction to the message text to prevent storage of sensitive information. 
  Visit the [Data Redaction](/security/data-redaction "Data Redaction") section to learn more.
  Reach out to your ASAPP account contact for information on available redaction capabilities to configure for your implementation.
</Note>

### Requesting Suggestions

ASAPP provides suggestions through one POST request to the AutoCompose API.

[`POST /autocompose/v1/conversations/\{conversationId\}/suggestions`](/apis/autocompose/generate-suggestions)

Use this endpoint to get suggestions for the next agent message in the conversation.

**When to Call**

This service should be called when an agent joins the conversation, after every agent keystroke, and after a message is sent by either the customer or the agent. In each of these instances, AutoCompose takes into account new conversation context (e.g. the next letter the agent typed) and will return suggestions suitable for that context.

<Note>
  If a conversation begins with messages between a customer and virtual agent/bot, ensure the conversation record is updated once the agent joins the conversation. Suggestion requests to this endpoint will fail if no agent is associated with a conversation.
</Note>

While making a request for a suggestion, a new sent message by either the customer or agent can be posted to the conversation record by including it in the request body. This optional approach to updating the conversation record is in lieu of sending a separate request to the `/messages` endpoint.

<Note>
  New messages cannot be added to the conversation record using the suggestions endpoint if no agent is associated with the conversation.
</Note>

**Request Details**

The path parameter for this request is the unique ASAPP conversation ID that was provided in the response body when the conversation record was initially created.

Requests must include any text that the agent has already typed (called the `query`).

To add a message to the conversation record during a suggestion request, you must also include a message object that contains the text of the sent message, the sender role and ID, and the timestamp for the sent message.

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with a set of suggestions or phrase completions, and a unique ASAPP identifier (`id`) that corresponds to this set of suggestions.

Full suggestions will be returned when the agent has not yet typed and early in the composition of their typed message. Once the agent's typed message is sufficiently complete, no suggestions will be returned.

Phrase completions are only provided when a high-confidence phrase is available to complete a partially typed message with several words. If no such phrases fit the message, phrase completions will not be returned.

If a message object was included in the request body, the response will include a message object with a unique message identifier.

**Metadata Inserts**

Suggestions will always include messages with `text` and `templateText` fields. `Text` fields contain the message as it should be shown in the end-user interface, whereas `templateText` indicates where metadata was inserted into a templated part of the message.

For example, `text` would read `"Sure John"`and `templateText` would read `"Sure \{NAME\}"`. AutoCompose currently supports inserting metadata about a customer name or agent name into a templated suggestion.

<Note>
  `templateText` will be returned even if there are no metadata elements being inserted into the suggestion `text`. In these cases, the `templateText` and `text` will be identical.
</Note>

### Check Profanity & Spelling

[`POST /autocompose/v1/profanity/evaluation`](/apis/autocompose/evaluate-profanity)

Use this endpoint to receive an evaluation of a text string to verify if it contains a word present on ASAPP's profanity blocklist.

**When to Call**

This service should be called when a carriage return or "enter" is used to send an agent message in order to prevent sending profanities in the chat.

**Request Details**

Requests need only specify the text required to be checked for profanity

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with a boolean indicating whether or not the submitted text contains profanity.

[`POST /autocompose/v1/spellcheck/correction`](/apis/autocompose/check-for-spelling-mistakes)

Use this endpoint to get a spelling correction for a message as it is being typed.

**When to Call**

This service should be called after a space character is entered, checking  the most recently completed word in the sentence.

**Request Details**

Requests must include the text the agent has typed and the position of the cursor to indicate which word the agent has just typed to be checked for spelling.

The request may also specify a user dictionary of any words that should not be corrected if present.

**Response Details**

When successful and a spelling mistake is present, this endpoint identifies the misspelled text, the correct spelling of the word and start position of the cursor where the misspelled word begins so that it can be replaced.

### Sending Agent Usage Data

[`POST /autocompose/v1/analytics/message-sent`](/apis/autocompose/create-a-messagesent-analytics-event)

Use this endpoint to create an analytics event describing the agent's usage of AutoCompose for a given message. ASAPP uses these events to train AutoCompose, identifying which forms of augmentation should be credited for contributing to the final sent message.

**When to Call**

This service should be called after both of the following have occurred:

1. A message has been submitted by an agent
2. A successful request has been made to add this message to ASAPP's record of the conversation

<Note>
  Message sent analytics events should be posted after every agent message regardless of whether any AutoCompose capabilities were used.
</Note>

**Request Details**

Requests must include the ASAPP identifiers for the conversation and the specific message about which the analytics data is about.

Requests must also include an array called `augmentationType` that describes the agent's sequence of AutoCompose usage before sending the message. Valid `augmentationType` values are described below:

| augmentationType     | When to Use                                                                                           |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AUTOSUGGEST          | When agent uses a full response suggestion with no text in the composer                               |
| AUTOCOMPLETE         | When agent uses a full response suggestion with text already in the composer                          |
| PHRASE\_AUTOCOMPLETE | When agent uses a phrase completion rather than a full response suggestion                            |
| CUSTOM\_DRAWER       | When agent inserts a custom message from a drawer menu in the composer                                |
| CUSTOM\_INSERT       | When agent inserts a custom message from a response panel                                             |
| GLOBAL\_INSERT       | When agent inserts a global message from a response panel                                             |
| FLUENCY\_APPLY       | When a fluency correction is applied to a word                                                        |
| FLUENCY\_UNDO        | When a fluency correction is undone                                                                   |
| FREEHAND             | When the agent types the entire message themselves and does not use any augmentation from AutoCompose |

Requests should include identifiers for the initial set of suggestions shown to the agent and the last set of suggestions where the agent made a selection (if any selections were made). If a selection was made, the index of the selected message (from the list of three) should also be specified.

Requests may also include further metadata describing the agents editing keystrokes after selecting a suggestion, their time crafting and waiting to send the message, the time between the last sent message and their first action, and their interactions with phrase completion suggestions (if relevant).

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint confirms the analytics message event was received and returns no response body.

### Getting Response Lists

ASAPP provides access to the global response list and agent-specific custom response lists through GET requests to two endpoints. Each endpoint is designed to be used to show an agent the contents of the response list in a user interface as they browse or search the list.

[`GET /autocompose/v1/responses/globals`](/apis/autocompose/list-the-global-responses)

Use this endpoint to retrieve the global responses and associated folder organization.

**When to Call**

This service should be called to show an agent the global response list - the list of responses available to all agents - in a user interface in response to an action taken by the agent, such as clicking on a response panel icon or searching for a specific response.

**Request Details**

Requests must include the agent's unique identifier from your system - this is the same identifier used to create conversation and conversation message records.

* Only values within a specific folder
* Only responses, only folders, or both
* Only values that match an agent search term

Requests can be returned in multiple pages based on a maximum per page parameter set to ensure a user interface only receives the number responses it can support. This endpoint can be called again with the same query parameters and a pageToken to indicate which page to retrieve in a multi-page list.

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with a response list (if requested) that fits the criteria of the request query parameters, including the id of the response along with the text, title, corresponding folder to which it belongs and any key-value pair metadata associated with the response.

As discussed previously in Metadata Inserts, responses can be templated to insert metadata into specific parts of the message, such as the customer or agent's name. ASAPP can also use metadata associated with a response (e.g. agent skills for which that response is allowed) to filter out that response from suggestions for a given conversation.

If there is a next page to the response list, a pageToken is provided in the response for use in a subsequent call to show the next page to the user.

This endpoint also responds with a folder list (if requested) including the identifier of the folder, its name, and parent folder (if one exists), and version information about the global list of responses from which this list is sourced.

<Note>
  Global responses are returned in alphabetical order, sorted on the text of the response. Folders are sorted by folder name.
</Note>

[`GET /autocompose/v1/responses/customs`](/apis/autocompose/get-custom-responses)

Use this endpoint to retrieve the custom responses and associated folder organization.

**When to Call**

This service should be called to show an agent their custom response list - the list of responses available to only that agent - in a user interface in response to an action taken by the agent, such as clicking on a response panel icon or searching for a specific response.

**Request Details**

Requests must include the agent's unique identifier from your system - this is the same identifier used to create conversation and conversation message records.

Requests may include parameters about what values the returned list should contain based on the context of the request:

* Only values within a specific folder
* Only responses, only folders, or both
* Only values that match an agent search term

Requests can be returned in multiple pages based on a maximum per page parameter set to ensure a user interface only receives the number responses it can support. This endpoint can be called again with the same query parameters and a pageToken to indicate which page to retrieve in a multi-page list.

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with a response list (if requested) that fits the criteria of the request query parameters, including the identifier of the response along with the text, title, corresponding folder to which it belongs and any key-value pair metadata associated with the response.

As discussed previously in Metadata Inserts, responses can be templated to insert metadata into specific parts of the message, such as the customer or agent's name. ASAPP can also use metadata associated with a response (e.g. agent skills/queues for which that response is allowed) to filter out that response from suggestions for a given conversation.

If there is a next page to the response list, a pageToken is provided in the response for use in a subsequent call to show the next page to the user.

This endpoint also responds with a folder list (if requested) including the identifier of the folder, its name, and parent folder (if one exists).

<Note>
  Custom responses are returned in alphabetical order, sorted on the title of the response. Folders are sorted by folder name.
</Note>

### Updating Custom Response Lists

Each agent's custom responses and the related folders can be added, updated and deleted using six endpoints. These endpoints are designed to carry out actions taken by agents in their personal list management interface.

#### For Responses

[`POST /autocompose/v1/responses/customs/response`](/apis/autocompose/create-a-custom-response)

## Certification

Before providing credentials for applications to use production services, ASAPP reviews your completed integration in the sandbox environment to certify that your application is ready.

The following criteria are used to certify that the integration is ready to use the AutoCompose API in a production environment:

* Under normal conditions, the integration is free of errors
* Under abnormal conditions, the integration provides the correct details in order to troubleshoot the issue
* The correct analytics events are being provided for agent messages that are sent

To test these criteria, an ASAPP Solution Architect will review these AutoCompose functionalities:

* Load a new customer conversation onto the agent desktop/view (with existing customer messages)
* Present the agent with suggestions and enable them to select an option and send
* Enable the agent to modify or add to a selected suggestion, and then send
* Enable the agent to freely type and use a phrase completion
* Enable the agent to use the spell check and profanity functionality
* Verify that correct analytics details are sent to ASAPP when an agent sends a message
* Disable API Keys in developer.asapp.com and generate an error message

The following are the test scenarios and accompanying sequence of expected API requests:

## Use Case Examples

### 1. Create a Conversation and Ask for Suggestions

The example below is a conversation post request with one customer message. Notice that the `id` value provided in the `/conversations` response is used as the `conversationId` path parameter in subsequent calls.

The conversation and message calls are followed by a suggestion request and response for the agent's reply which includes two suggestions without a title and one suggestion with a title. The `phraseCompletion` field is not returned, as the agent has only just begun typing their message with `"query": "Sure"` when this suggestion request was made.

**POST** `/conversation/v1/conversations`

**Request**

```json
{
  "externalId": "33411121",
  "agent": {
    "externalId": "671",
    "name": "agentname"
  },
  "customer": {
    "externalId": "11462",
    "name": "Sarah Jones"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "organizationalGroup": "some-group",
    "subdivision": "some-division",
    "queue": "some-queue"
  },

}
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Successfully created or updated conversation*

```json
{
  "id": "5544332211"
}
```

**POST** `/conversation/v1/conversations/5544332211/messages`

**Request**

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
  "sender": {
    "role": "customer",
    "externalId": "3455123"
  },
  "timestamp": "2021-11-23T12:13:18.55Z"
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "099455443322115544332211"
}
```

**POST** `/autocompose/v1/conversations/5544332211/suggestions`
**Request**

```json
{
  "query": "Sure"
}
```

**Response**
*STATUS 200: Successfully fetched suggestions for the conversation*

```json
{
  "id": "453466732233",
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "text": "Sure, can I get your account number for verification please?",
      "templateText": "Sure, can I get your account number for verification please?",
      "title": ""
    },    
    {
      "text": "Sure Sarah, I can certainly help you with that.",
      "templateText": "Sure {NAME}, I can certainly help you with that.",
      "title": ""
    },
    {
      "text": "The GOLD plan is a great choice",
      "templateText": "The GOLD plan is a great choice",
      "title": "Gold plan great choice"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Check Profanity

The example below is of a profanity check request and response for a text string that does not contain any words found in the profanity blocklist:

**POST** `/autocompose/v1/profanity/evaluation`

**Request**

```json
{
  "text": "This is a perfectly decent sentence."
}
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Successfully fetched an evaluation result of the sentence.*

```json
{
  "hasProfanity": false
}
```

### 3. Check Spelling

The example below is of a spell check request and response for a text string that contains a misspelling in the last typed word of the string:

**POST** `/autocompose/v1/spellcheck/correction`

**Request**

```json
{
  {
  "text": "How is tihs ",
  "typingEvent": {
    "cursorStart": 11,
    "cursorEnd": 12
  },
  "userDictionary": [
    "Hellooo"
  ]
}
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Successfully checked for a spelling mistake.*

```json
{
  "misspelledText": "tihs",
  "correctedText": "this",
  "position": 7
}
```

### 4. Send an Analytics Message Event

The example below is of an analytics message event being sent to ASAPP that provides metadata about how an agent used AutoCompose for a given message.
For this message example, the agent used a spelling correction, selected the first response suggestion offered, and subsequently used the first phrase completion presented to finish the sentence, in that order.
**POST** `/autocompose/v1/analytics/message-sent`
**Request**

```json
{
  "conversationId": "5544332211",
  "messageId": "ee675e6576c0faf40dbb92d0d5993f5f",
  "augmentationType": [
    "FLUENCY_APPLY",
    "AUTOSUGGEST",
    "PHRASE_AUTOCOMPLETE"
  ],
  "numEdits": 2,
  "selectedSuggestionText": "How can I help you today?",
  "selectedSuggestionsId": "5e9491b203e6ecccfef964e26fb1a5d3",
  "selectedSuggestionIndex": 1,
  "initialSuggestionsId": "5e9491b203e6ecccfef964e26fb1a5d3",
  "timeToAction": 1.891412,
  "craftingTime": 10.9472,
  "dwellTime": 4.132985,
  "phraseAutocompletePresentedCt": 1,
  "phraseAutocompleteSelectedCt": 1
}
```

**Response**
*STATUS 200: Successfully created a MessageSent event.*
In this example, the agent typed a message and sent it without using any assistance from AutoCompose:
**Request**

```json
 {
  "messageId": "ee675e6576c0faf40dbb92d0d5993e2q",
  "augmentationType": [
    "FREEHAND"
  ],
  "initialSuggestionsId": "5e9491b303e6ecccfef164e26fb1afq9",
  "timeToAction": 2.891412,
  "craftingTime": 20.9472,
  "dwellTime": 5.132985
}
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Successfully created a MessageSent event.*

In this example, the agent typed "hel", selected the second suggestion presented to them and sent it:

**Request**

```json
 {
  "messageId": "ee675e1236c0faf40dcb92h0e5y93e2p",
  "augmentationType": [
    "AUTOCOMPLETE"
  ],
  "selectedSuggestionText": "Hello there, welcome to customer support chat!",
  "selectedSuggestionsId": "4d2fd982640c311394008259594399a1",
  "selectedSuggestionIndex": 2,
  "initialSuggestionsId": "4d2fd982640c311394008259594399a1",
  "timeToAction": 1.891412,
  "craftingTime": 11.9472,
  "dwellTime": 2.132985
}
```

**Response**
*STATUS 200: Successfully created a MessageSent event.*
In this example, the agent typed "htis", hit the space bar, and spellcheck corrected the text to "this". Then the agent accidentally reversed the spell check and sent the message to the customer without using any other AutoCompose assistance:
**Request**

```json
 {
  "messageId": "fe675e1236c0fbf40dcb33h0e5y93e1d",
  "augmentationType": [
    "FLUENCY_APPLY",
    "FLUENCY_UNDO"
  ],
  "initialSuggestionsId": "2d2fd982640c311146008259594399a2",
  "timeToAction": 1.891412,
  "craftingTime": 11.9472,
  "dwellTime": 2.132985
}
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Successfully created a MessageSent event.*

### 5. Show an Agent Global Responses

The example below is of a request to show global responses only to an agent who is searching the greetings folder for a particular response. **NOTE**: The response below is shortened to show two responses.

**GET** `/autocompose/v1/responses/globals`

**Request**

*Query Parameters:*

```json
        folderId: "9923599"
        resourceType: "responses"
        searchTerm: "transfer"
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: The global responses for this company*

```json
{
  "responses": {
    "responsesList": [
      {
        "id": "425523523599",
        "text": "I’d be happy to transfer you to my supervisor.",
        "title": "Sup Transfer 2",
        "folderId": "9923599",
      },
      {

            "allowedValues": [
              "customer.name"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
  },
  "version": {
    "id": "12134",
    "description": "June 5 2022 Update"
  }
}
```

### 6. Creating a New Custom Response Folder and Response

The example below shows the calls that would accompany an agent creating a new greeting custom response without a folder, then adding it to an existing folder.

**POST** `/autocompose/v1/responses/customs/response`

**Request**

```json
{
  "text": "Howdy, how can I help you today?",
  "title": "Howdy Help"

  "text": "Howdy, how can I help you today?",
  "title": "Howdy Help",
  "folderId": "9923523"
}
```

**Response**

*STATUS 201: Acknowledgement that the custom response was successfully updated*

## Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission, from first user authentication, to secure communications, to our auditing and logging system, all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in the data logging system. Access to data by ASAPP teams is tightly constrained and monitored. Strict security protocols protect both ASAPP and our customers.

The following security controls are particularly relevant to AutoCompose:

1. Client sessions are controlled using a time-limited authorization token. Privileges for each active session are controlled server-side to mitigate potential elevation-of-privilege and information disclosure risks.
2. To avoid unauthorized disclosure of information, unique, non-guessable IDs are used to identify conversations. These conversations can only be accessed using a valid client session.
3. Requests to API endpoints that can potentially receive sensitive data are put through a round of redaction to strip the request of sensitive data (like SSNs and phone numbers).

## Additional Considerations

### Historical Conversation Data for Generating a Response List

ASAPP uses past agent conversations to generate a customized response list tailored to a given use case. In order to create an accurate and relevant list, ASAPP requires a minimum of 200,000 historical transcripts to be supplied ahead of implementing AutoCompose.

For more information on how to transmit the conversation data, reach out to your ASAPP account contact.

Visit [Transmitting Data to SFTP](/reporting/send-sftp "Transmitting Data to SFTP") for instructions on how to send historical transcripts to ASAPP.


# Deploying AutoCompose for LivePerson
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autocompose/deploying-autocompose-for-liveperson

Use AutoCompose on your LivePerson application.

## Overview

This page describes how to Integrate AutoCompose in your LivePerson application.

### Integration Steps

There are four parts to the AutoCompose setup process. Use the links below to skip to information about a specific part of the process:

1. [Install the ASAPP browser extension](#1-install-the-asapp-browser-extension) on all agents' desktop (via a system policy or using your company's existing deployment processes)
2. [Configure the LivePerson organization](#2-configure-liveperson) centrally using an administrator account
3. [Setup agent/user authentication](#3-set-up-single-sign-on) through the existing single sign-on (SSO) service
4. [Work with your ASAPP contact to configure Auto-Pilot Greetings](#4-configure-auto-pilot-greetings), if desired

## Requirements

**Browser Support**

ASAPP AutoCompose is supported in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge

* NOTE: This support covers the latest version of each browser and extends to the previous two versions

Please consult your ASAPP account contact if your installation requires support for other browsers

**LivePerson**

ASAPP supports LivePerson's Messaging conversation type

</Frame>

**SSO Support**

The AutoCompose widget supports SP-initiated SSO with either OIDC (preferred method) or SAML.

**Domain Whitelisting**

In order for AutoCompose to interact with ASAPP's backend and third-party support services, the following domains need to be accessible from end-user environments:

| Domain                                     | Description                                                        |
| :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \*.asapp.com                               | ASAPP service URLs                                                 |
| \*.ingest.sentry.io                        | Application performance monitoring tool                            |
| fonts.googleapis.com                       | Fonts                                                              |
| google-analytics.com                       | Page analytics                                                     |
| asapp-chat-sdk-production.s3.amazonaws.com | Static ASAPP AWS URL for desktop network connectivity health check |

**Policy Check**

Before proceeding, check the current order of precedence of policies deployed in your organization. Platform-deployed policies (like Group Policy Objects) and cloud-deployed policies (like Google Admin Console) are enforced in a priority order that can lead to lower-priority policies not being enforced.

* If installing the ASAPP browser extension via Group Policy Objects, set platform policies to have precedence over cloud policies.
* If installing the ASAPP browser extension via Google Admin Console, set cloud policies to have precedence over platform policies.
  For more on how to check and modify order of precedence, see [policy management guides from Google Enterprise](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9037717).

## Integrate with LivePerson

### 1. Install the ASAPP Browser Extension

Customers have two options for installing the AutoCompose browser extension:

A.  Group Policy Objects (GPO)

B.  Google Admin Console

#### A. Install Group Policy Objects (GPO)

Customers can automatically install and manage the ASAPP AutoCompose browser extension via Group Policy Objects (GPO). ASAPP provides an installation server from which the extension can be downloaded and automatically updated.

The Customer's system administrator must configure GPO rules to allow the installation server URL and the software component ID. Through GPO, the administrator can choose to force the installation (i.e., install without requiring human intervention).

The following policies will configure Chrome and Edge to download the AutoCompose browser extension in all on-premise managed devices via GPO:

| **Policy Name**                                                                                                         | **Value to Set**                                                                                                                                                                |

Each Policy Name above links to documentation that describes how to set the values with the proper format depending on the platform.

<Note>
  When policy changes occur, you may need to reload policies manually or force restart the browser to ensure newly deployed policies are applied.
</Note>

Figure 2 shows example policy files for the Windows platform. The policy adds the URL 'https\://\*.asapp.com/\*' as a valid extension install source, allows the extension ID 'bfcmlmledhddbnialbbdopfefoelbbei', and forces the extension installation.

Google Chrome:

```registry
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome]
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome\ExtensionInstallAllowlist]
"1"="bfcmlmledhddbnialbbdopfefoelbbei"

#### B. Install via Google Admin Console

For Google Chrome deployments, customers can install and manage the ASAPP AutoCompose browser extension using Managed Chrome Device policies in the Google Admin console. The Customer's system administrator must set up the AutoCompose browser extension through the Google Admin console by creating a custom app and configuring the extension ID and XML manifest URL. Through managed Chrome policies the administrator can choose to force the installation (i.e. install without requiring human intervention).

In order to have Chrome download the ASAPP hosted extension in all managed devices through the Google Admin console:

1. Navigate to **Device management > Chrome**.
2. Click **Apps & Extensions**.
3. Click on **Add (+)** and look for **Add Chrome app or extension by ID** option.
4. Complete the fields using the values provided below. Be sure to select the **From a custom URL** option.

| **Field** | **Value**                                                                                                                                      |

<Note>
  To ensure that cloud policies are enabled for production environment users in a given organizational unit, locate that group of users by navigating to **Devices** > **Chrome** > **Settings** menu in Google Suite.

  Ensure the setting **[Chrome management for signed-in users](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2657289?hl=en#zippy=%2Cchrome-management-for-signed-in-users)** is set to **Apply all user policies when users sign into Chrome, and provide a managed Chrome experience.**
</Note>

**Testing**

The following two checks on a target machine will verify the extension is installed correctly:

1. **The extension is force-installed in the browser**
   a.  Expand the extension icon in the browser toolbar.
   b.  Alternatively, navigate to chrome://extensions/ or edge://extensions/ and look for 'ASAPP Extension'
   c.  Alternatively, navigate to edge://extensions/ and look for 'ASAPP Extension'
2. **The extension is properly configured**
   a.  Click the extension icon and validate that the allowlist and denylist values in the extension's options are as they were set.
   b.  Alternatively, navigate to chrome://policy and search for the extension policies.
   c.  Alternatively, navigate to edge://policy and search for the extension policies.

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-4b2626ec-266c-fbcf-f28f-0c10080ea306.png" />
</Frame>

### 3. Set Up Single Sign-On

ASAPP handles authentication through the customer's SSO service to confirm the identity of the agent.

ASAPP acts as the Service Provider (SP) with the customer acting as the Identity Provider (IDP). The customer's authentication system performs user authentication using their existing user credentials.

ASAPP supports SP-initiated SSO with either OIDC (preferred method) and SAML. Once the user initiates sign-in, ASAPP detects that the user is authenticated and requests an assertion from the customer's SSO service.

**Configuration Steps for OIDC (preferred method)**

1. Create a new IDP OIDC application with type `Web`
2. Set the following attributes for the app:
   <table class="informaltable frame-void rules-rows">
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th class="th"><p>Attribute</p></th>
         <th class="th"><p>Value\*</p></th>
       </tr>
     </thead>

     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td class="td"><p>Grant Type</p></td>
         <td class="td"><p>authorization code</p></td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td class="td"><p>Sign-in Redirect URIs</p></td>

         <td class="td">
           <p>Production: [https://api.asapp.com/auth/v1/callback/\\\{company\_marker\\}](https://api.asapp.com/auth/v1/callback/\\\{company_marker\\})</p>
           <p>Sandbox: [https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/auth/v1/callback/\\\{company\_marker\\}-sandbox](https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/auth/v1/callback/\\\{company_marker\\}-sandbox)</p>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
   **\*NOTE:** ASAPP to provide `company_marker` value
3. Save the application and send ASAPP the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the app through a secure communication channel
4. Set scopes for the OIDC application:
   * Required: `openid`
   * Preferred: `email`, `profile`
5. Tell ASAPP which end-user attribute should be used a unique identifier
6. Tell ASAPP your IDP domain name

**Configuration Steps for SAML**

1. Create a new IDP SAML application.
2. Set the following attributes for the app:

   | Attribute            | Value\*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

   **\*NOTE:** ASAPP to provide `company_marker` value
3. Save the application and send the Public Certificate to validate Signature for this app SAML payload to ASAPP team
4. Send ASAPP team the URL of the SAML application

### 4. Configure Auto-Pilot Greetings

If you so choose, you can work with your ASAPP contact to enable Auto-Pilot Greetings in your AutoCompose installation.

Auto-Pilot Greetings automatically generates a greeting at the beginning of a conversation, and that greeting can be automatically sent to a customer on your agent's behalf after a configurable timer elapses.

Your ASAPP contact can:

* Turn Auto-Pilot Greetings on or off for your organization
* Set a countdown timer value after which the Auto-Pilot Greeting is sent if an agent does not cancel Auto-Pilot by typing or clicking a "cancel" button
* Set the global default messages that will be provided for Auto-Pilot Greetings across your organization (note that agents can optionally customize their Auto-Pilot Greetings messages within the Auto-Pilot tab of the AutoCompose panel)

## Usage

### Customization

#### LivePerson

For LivePerson, the standard process is to download ASAPP AutoCompose as a standalone widget. In the case that you already have your own LivePerson custom widget, ASAPP also provides the option for you to embed our custom widget inside your own custom widget, thus economizing on-screen real estate.

**Conversation Attributes**

Once the ASAPP AutoCompose widget is embedded, LivePerson shares the following conversation attributes with ASAPP: customer name, agent name and skill.

ASAPP can use name attributes to populate values into templated responses (e.g. "Hi \[customer name], how can I help you today?") and to selectively filter response lists based on the skill of the conversation.

**Conversation Redaction**

When message text in the conversation transcript is sent to ASAPP, ASAPP applies redaction to the message text to prevent transmission of sensitive information. Reach out to your ASAPP account contact for information on available redaction capabilities to configure for your implementation.

### Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission from first user authentication, to secure communications, to our auditing and logging system, all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in the data logging system. Access to data by ASAPP teams is tightly constrained and monitored. Strict security protocols protect both ASAPP and our customers.

The following security controls are particularly relevant to AutoCompose:

1. Client sessions are controlled using a time-limited authorization token. Privileges for each active session are controlled server-side to mitigate potential elevation-of-privilege and information disclosure risks.
2. To avoid unauthorized disclosure of information, unique, non-guessable IDs are used to identify conversations. These conversations can only be accessed using a valid client session.
3. Requests to API endpoints that can potentially receive sensitive data are put through a round of redaction to strip the request of sensitive data (like SSNs and phone numbers).

### Additional Considerations

#### Historical Conversation Data for Generating a Response List

ASAPP uses past agent conversations to generate a customized response list tailored to a given use case. In order to create an accurate and relevant list, ASAPP requires a minimum of 200,000 historical transcripts to be supplied ahead of implementing AutoCompose.

For more information on how to transmit the conversation data, reach out to your ASAPP account contact.

#### LivePerson

ASAPP uses a browser extension to replace the LivePerson composer with the ASAPP composer. In the unlikely event that the DOM of the LivePerson composer or its surrounding area changes, the LivePerson composer may no longer be replaced by the ASAPP composer.

In this case, the CSR has the option to toggle the ASAPP composer so that it 'retreats' into the ASAPP Custom Widget. In such a case, the ASAPP composer will continue to be fully functional, even if it is no longer ideally placed just below the LivePerson chat history.

In order to quickly restore the placement of the ASAPP composer directly beneath the LivePerson chat log, ASAPP deploys its extension so that the extension's configuration is pulled down from our servers in real-time. If the LivePerson DOM does change, we can deploy a fix rapidly.


# Deploying AutoCompose for Salesforce
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autocompose/deploying-autocompose-for-salesforce

Use AutoCompose on Salesforce Lightning Experience.

## Overview

This page describes how to Integrate AutoCompose in your Salesforce application.

### Integration Steps

There are three parts to the AutoCompose setup process. Use the links below to skip to information about a specific part of the process:

1. [Configure the Salesforce organization](#1-configure-the-salesforce-organization-centrally) centrally using an administrator account
2. [Setup agent/user authentication](#2-set-up-single-sign-on) through the existing single sign-on (SSO) service
3. [Work with your ASAPP contact to configure Auto-Pilot Greetings](#3-configure-auto-pilot-greetings), if desired

<Tip>
  Expected effort for each part of the setup process:

  * 1 hour for installation and configuration of the ASAPP chat components
  * 1-2 hours to enable user authentication, depending on SSO system complexity
</Tip>

## Requirements

**Browser Support**

ASAPP AutoCompose is supported in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge

<Tip>
  NOTE: This support covers the latest version of each browser and extends to the previous two versions

  Please consult your ASAPP account contact if your installation requires support for other browsers
</Tip>

**Salesforce**

ASAPP supports Lightning-based chat (cf. classic)

</Frame>

**SSO Support**

The AutoCompose widget supports SP-initiated SSO with either OIDC (preferred method) or SAML.

**Domain Whitelisting**

In order for AutoCompose to interact with ASAPP's backend and third-party support services, the following domains need to be accessible from end-user environments:

| Domain                                     | Description                                                        |

### 2. Set Up Single Sign-On

ASAPP handles authentication through the customer's SSO service to confirm the identity of the agent.

ASAPP acts as the Service Provider (SP) with the customer acting as the Identity Provider (IDP). The customer's authentication system performs user authentication using their existing user credentials.

ASAPP supports SP-initiated SSO with either OIDC (preferred method) and SAML. Once the user initiates sign-in, ASAPP detects that the user is authenticated and requests an assertion from the customer's SSO service.

**Configuration Steps for OIDC (preferred method)**

1. Create a new IDP OIDC application with type `Web`

2. Set the following attributes for the app:
   <table class="informaltable frame-void rules-rows">
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th class="th"><p>Attribute</p></th>
         <th class="th"><p>Value\*</p></th>
       </tr>
     </thead>

     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td class="td"><p>Grant Type</p></td>
         <td class="td"><p>authorization code</p></td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td class="td"><p>Sign-in Redirect URIs</p></td>

         <td class="td">
           <p>Production: `https://api.asapp.com/auth/v1/callback/\{company_marker\}`</p>
           <p>Sandbox: `https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/auth/v1/callback/\{company_marker\}-sandbox`</p>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
   **\*NOTE:** ASAPP to provide `company_marker` value

3. Save the application and send ASAPP the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the app through a secure communication channel

4. Set scopes for the OIDC application:
   * Required: `openid`
   * Preferred: `email`, `profile`

5. Tell ASAPP which end-user attribute should be used a unique identifier

6. Tell ASAPP your IDP domain name

**Configuration Steps for SAML**

1. Create a new IDP SAML application.
2. Set the following attributes for the app:

   | Attribute            | Value\*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### 3. Configure Auto-Pilot Greetings

If you so choose, you can work with your ASAPP contact to enable Auto-Pilot Greetings in your AutoCompose installation.
Auto-Pilot Greetings automatically generates a greeting at the beginning of a conversation, and that greeting can be automatically sent to a customer on your agent's behalf after a configurable timer elapses.

Your ASAPP contact can:

* Turn Auto-Pilot Greetings on or off for your organization
* Set a countdown timer value after which the Auto-Pilot Greeting is sent if an agent does not cancel Auto-Pilot by typing or clicking a "cancel" button
* Set the global default messages that will be provided for Auto-Pilot Greetings across your organization (note that agents can optionally customize their Auto-Pilot Greetings messages within the Auto-Pilot tab of the AutoCompose panel)

## Usage

### Customization

#### Conversation Attributes

Once the ASAPP AutoCompose widget is embedded, Salesforce shares the following conversation attributes with ASAPP: customer name, agent name and skill.

ASAPP can use name attributes to populate values into templated responses (e.g. "Hi \[customer name], how can I help you today?") and to selectively filter response lists based on the skill of the conversation.

#### Conversation Redaction

When message text in the conversation transcript is sent to ASAPP, ASAPP applies redaction to the message text to prevent transmission of sensitive information. Reach out to your ASAPP account contact for information on available redaction capabilities to configure for your implementation.

#### Composer Placement

ASAPP currently targets Lightning desktops. Within Lightning-based desktops, you are free to place our composer wherever you choose. However, we suggest placing it immediately below the Salesforce conversation widget, such that the chat log appears above the ASAPP composer.

### Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission from first user authentication, to secure communications, to our auditing and logging system, all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in the data logging system. Access to data by ASAPP teams is tightly constrained and monitored. Strict security protocols protect both ASAPP and our customers.

The following security controls are particularly relevant to AutoCompose:

1. Client sessions are controlled using a time-limited authorization token. Privileges for each active session are controlled server-side to mitigate potential elevation-of-privilege and information disclosure risks.
2. To avoid unauthorized disclosure of information, unique, non-guessable IDs are used to identify conversations. These conversations can only be accessed using a valid client session.
3. Requests to API endpoints that can potentially receive sensitive data are put through a round of redaction to strip the request of sensitive data (like SSNs and phone numbers).

### Additional Considerations

#### Historical Conversation Data for Generating a Response List

ASAPP uses past agent conversations to generate a customized response list tailored to a given use case. In order to create an accurate and relevant list, ASAPP requires a minimum of 200,000 historical transcripts to be supplied ahead of implementing AutoCompose.

For more information on how to transmit the conversation data, reach out to your ASAPP account contact.


# AutoCompose Product Guide
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autocompose/product-guide

Learn more about the features and insights of AutoCompose

## Getting Started

This page provides an overview of the features and functionalities in AutoCompose.

After AutoCompose is integrated into your applications, you can use its features to scale up your agent responses.

<Note>
  The following UI descriptions are examples of AutoCompose Integrations with LivePerson and Salesforce.
  API-based integrations do not include custom UIs.
</Note>

### Suggestions

AutoCompose supports agents throughout the conversation with both complete response suggestions before they type and suggestions while typing to complete their sentence.

The machine learning models powering AutoCompose suggestions use the entire conversation context (not just the last few responses) and personal agent response history to predict the most likely next agent message or phrase in the conversation.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-646b67c6-650e-2baf-b18b-31cb81ba966a.png" />
</Frame>

### Response Library

AutoCompose suggests responses from a library curated from a wide range of domain-specific conversation topics. The response library is a combination of three lists:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-2ee5ac6b-e459-ad20-3eea-939ce44e089a.png" />
</Frame>

1. **Global response list:** Messages created and maintained by program administrators available to a designated full agent population.
2. **Custom response list:** Messages created and maintained directly in AutoCompose by individual agents; only available to the agent that created the message.
3. **Organically growing response list:** Messages automatically created by ASAPP for each agent based on their most commonly used messages that do not already exist in the global response list or the agent's curated custom response list.

<Tip>
  Agents use custom responses to make their favorite messages readily available for sending quickly: well-honed explanations for difficult processes and concepts, discovery questions, personal anecdotes, and greetings and farewells infused with their personal style.  Agents often curate their custom responses based on global responses, with a bit of their own personal touch.
</Tip>

### Agent Interface

AutoCompose provides three complete response suggestions in the drawer above the composer both before typing begins and in the early stages of message composition; phrase completion suggestions are made directly in-line as more of a sentence is typed.

Agents can also search for a response in two places:

1. **Composer:** As agents type, they can choose to search for their typed text in the global response list to see the full list of related messages with that term.
   By typing `/` in the empty composer, agents can also browse their custom response library by using either the message text or title of the custom response as a search term.
   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-fa73a5df-bb23-2a08-2b79-beff50effdc8.png" />
   </Frame>
2. **Response panel:** In the response panel, agents can browse both the global and custom response lists, either using a folder hierarchy or with the provided search field.
   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-eb6d75f8-8a20-6bd2-66e2-8933fef91fe0.png" />
   </Frame>

<Note>
  The organically growing response list is not available for agents to browse - responses from this list only appear in suggestions.  Agents are encouraged to add these frequently used responses to their custom response list.
</Note>

### Autocomplete

Once the agent begins typing, AutoCompose provides two forms of autocomplete suggestions at different stages in the message composition:

* As the agent begins typing a message, complete response suggestions are available. At this point, the agent is in the early stages of composing their response and several potential complete response options are relevant.
* After several words are typed, a high-confidence phrase completion can be recommended in-line to help agents finish their already well-formed thought.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-4fc5f306-00fa-07a2-a43e-6b950b1bb065.png" />
</Frame>

Phrase completions are generated from common, high-frequency phrases used in each implementation's production conversations. AutoCompose only makes phrase suggestions when a sufficiently high-confidence phrase is available and only uses language found in the global and custom response library.

### Templated Responses

AutoCompose can dynamically insert metadata into designated templated responses in the global response list.

For example, a customer's first name can be automatically populated into this templated response: "Hi *\{name}*, how can I help you today?".

By default, AutoCompose supports inserting customer first name, agent first name and the customer's time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) into templated responses. Time of day can be set to a single zone or be dynamically determined for each conversation.

AutoCompose also supports inserting custom conversation-specific metadata passed to ASAPP. For more information on custom inserts, reach out to your ASAPP account team.

<Note>
  If the needed metadata is unavailable for a particular templated response (e.g. there is no customer name available), that response will not be suggested by AutoCompose.
</Note>

### Fluency and Profanity

**Fluency Boosting**

AutoCompose automatically corrects commonly misspelled words once the space bar is pressed following a given word.

Corrections are underlined in the composer for agent-awareness and can be undone if needed by hovering over the corrected word.

**Profanity Blocking**

AutoCompose checks for profanity in messages when the agent attempts to send the message. If any terms match ASAPP's profanity criteria, the message will not be sent and the agent will be informed.

## Customization

### Suggestion Model

The AutoCompose suggestion model functions as a custom recommendation service for each agent. The model references the global response list, a library of custom responses created by each agent, and also learns from each agent's unique production message-sending behaviors to surface the best responses.

### Global Response List

Prior to deployment, ASAPP can generate a domain-relevant global response list using representative historical conversations as an input. This is a highly recommended customization to ensure agents receive useful, relevant suggestions as early as possible.

<Note>
  If historical conversation data is unavailable prior to deploying AutoCompose, production conversations after deployment can be used to adapt the response list at a later date.
</Note>

| **Option**      | **Description**                                                                                            | **Requirements**                                                 |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model-generated | Fully-custom global response list that extracts relevant terminology and sentences from real conversations | 200,000 historical transcripts to enable prior to implementation |

For more information on sending historical transcript files to ASAPP, see [Transmitting Data to ASAPP](/reporting/send-s3#historical-transcript-file-structure).

### Queue/Skill Response List Filtering

AutoCompose can filter the global response list by agent queue/skill for a given conversation. For example, a subset of responses appropriate only for sales conversations can be labeled to be removed from technical troubleshooting conversations.

Responses are labeled with applicable queue(s)/skill(s) and are unavailable for suggestion if their labels do not match the conversation.

| **Option**                                  | **Description**                                                                                              | **Requirements**                          |
| :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Global Response List with filter attributes | Global responses are labeled with optional attributes for skills for which they are exclusively appropriate. | Review and labeling of specific responses |

## Use Cases

### For Improved Agent Productivity

**Challenge**

Agents spend a lot of time manually crafting responses to similar customer problems.  Using scripts can make the conversation sound robotic, so agents who do use canned responses spend a lot of time adjusting the language to sound more like them or use them too rarely to impact their response time or ability to handle multiple conversations concurrently.

Average response crafting time and messaging concurrency, even with canned response library usage, remains high for most digital messaging programs.

**Using AutoCompose**

AutoCompose drastically reduces crafting time by not only serving up response suggestions from a much more exhaustive set of responses, but it also addresses the problem of canned responses sounding overly generic by empowering agents to craft messaging in their personal style.

This is why adoption, and therefore efficiency gains overall, are so impressive when AutoCompose is deployed.

### For CX Quality and Consistency

**Challenge**

Agents have a lot of information to learn to become domain experts and are often handling issues with which they have limited experience or that they have trouble recalling the best way to handle.

Many companies use a variety of resources that agents have to search through to find answers on how to best handle a customer's problem.  This can be difficult for an agent to juggle while in a live conversation, especially if they are unsure where to begin their search.

**Using AutoCompose**

AutoCompose learns from the global population of agents over time, which is incredibly useful to newer agents or agents who are beginning to handle conversation in a newer domain.

While the model may not initially have much indication on language that a particular agent likes to use, it naturally adapts to this by surfacing up suggestions from the global response list and global history of how similar conversations have been handled in the past.  This helps ensure that agents follow consistent behaviors when handling issues that they are less certain about.

## FAQs

### Model Improvement

**How does the suggestion model improve over time?**

The model is automatically trained weekly on the latest historical data, informed by agent interactions with AutoCompose at given moments of conversations. As more situational agent behaviors are observed, better response suggestions are surfaced at more relevant points in the conversation.

**Does the model adapt to topics not seen before?**

As a baseline, models are able to make inferences about what existing responses are most relevant even if the topic is new.

**Do new topics require new entries to be added to the global response list?**

Major new topics are best handled by updating the global response list with appropriate responses. If, for example, you want to prepare for a new product launch, our recommendation is to make additions and edits to the global response list in advance, then upload on the day of the launch.

Our models will immediately start making suggestions from the updated response list. As more agents use the system, the models will become even smarter at identifying when these new responses should be suggested.4.

### Response Lists

**How is the global response list updated?**

AI-Console gives program administrators full control to make targeted or bulk updates to the global response list and manage deployments of those changes. Once deployed to production, response list changes are immediately available to agents.

For more information, refer to the [AutoCompose Tooling Guide](/autocompose/autocompose-tooling-guide "AutoCompose Tooling Guide").

**Does the global response list change automatically?**

The global response list does not automatically update. It is managed exclusively by product owners for a given implementation.

The organically growing list of commonly used responses updates automatically without need for manual updates.

**What is the difference between the global and custom response list?**

The global response list is managed by center leadership and contains a comprehensive list of responses available across the agent population. This list is intended to be the recommended wording for responding to customers.

The custom response list is managed by each agent and is exclusively accessible to them. Responses in the custom response list are suggested by AutoCompose alongside entries in the global response list. Like the global response list, the custom response list also supports a folder structure and can be manually searched by the agent.

**Does the suggestion model act differently from one agent to the next?**

The suggestion model uses the agent's live conversation context and uses agent-specific response from both the custom response list and the organically-growing response list. AutoCompose suggestion models are not unique to each agent, but have different inputs and potential responses that personalize their experience.

**Can the global response list be customized by queue/skill?**

Yes. When the global response list is being created or edited, ASAPP can add metadata to specific responses that make them eligible for specific queues or skills, and ineligible for suggestions for all others.
For example, a set of 40 responses may only be applicable for an escalation queue, and be tagged such that they don't appear as suggestions in any conversation that appears in another queue.

# Free text Summary
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autosummary/free-text-summary

Generate conversation summaries with Free text summary

A Free text summary is a generated summary or description from a conversation.

AutoSummary generates high-quality, free-text summaries that are fully configurable in both format and content. You have the flexibility to include or exclude targeted elements based on your needs.

This eliminates the need for agents to take notes during, or after calls, and to minimize post-call forms.

## How it works

To help understand how free-text summary works, let's use an example conversation:

> **Agent**: Hello, thank you for contacting XYZ Insurance. How can I assist you today?\
> **Customer**: Hi, I want to check the status of my payout for my claim.\
> **Agent**: Sure, can you please provide me with the claim number?\
> **Customer**: It's H123456789.\
> **Agent**: Thank you. Could you also provide the last 4 digits of your account number?\
> **Customer**: 6789\
> **Agent**: Let me check the details for you. One moment, please.\
> **Agent**: I see that your claim was approved on June 10, 2024, for \$5000. The payout has been processed.\
> **Customer**: Great! When will I receive the money?\
> **Agent**: The payout will be credited to your account within 3-5 business days.\
> **Customer**: Perfect, thank you so much for your help.\
> **Agent**: You’re welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?\
> **Customer**: No, that's all. Have a nice day.\
> **Agent**: You too. Goodbye!

Each word in a paragraph summary is selected uniquely for a given conversation transcript, rather than using predefined tags. The paragraph incorporates language used by the customer and agent in order to create a faithful representation of what was discussed in the conversation.

<Info>Since the summary is generated, there may be minor variations in grammar if you repeatedly generate  summaries for the same conversation.</Info>

Here is an example summary generated from the above conversation:

> The customer inquired about the status of a payout for an approved claim. The agent confirmed that the claim was approved and the payout has been processed and will be credited within 3-5 business days.

For conversations that involve transfers or multiple agents, AutoSummary can generate summaries for both the entire multi-leg conversation and specific legs.

## Generate a free text summary

To generate a free text summary, provide the conversation transcript into ASAPP first.

This example uses our conversation API, but you have options to use AutoTranscribe or batch integration options.

### Step 1: Create a conversation

To create a **`conversation`**. Provide your Ids for the conversation and customer.

```javascript
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ 
  "externalId": "[Your id for the conversation]",
  "customer": {   
    "externalId": "[Your id for the customer]",
    "name": "customer name" 
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
}'
```

A successfully created conversation returns a status code of 200 and a conversation Id.

### Step 2: Add messages

You need to add the messages for the conversation.

In this example, we are using the `/messages/batch` endpoint to add the whole example conversation.

```javascript
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations/5544332211/messages/batch' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "messages": [
    {
      "text": "Hello, thank you for contacting XYZ Insurance. How can I assist you today?",
      "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "Hi, I want to check the status of my payout for my claim.",
      "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:01:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "Sure, can you please provide me with the claim number?",
      "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:02:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "It\'s H123456789.",
      "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:03:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you. Could you also provide the last 4 digits of your account number?",
      "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:04:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "****",
      "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:05:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "Let me check the details for you. One moment, please.",
      "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:06:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "I see that your claim was approved on June 10, ****, for ****. The payout has been processed.",
      "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:07:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "Great! When will I receive the money?",
      "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:08:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "The payout will be credited to your account within 3-5 business days.",
      "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:09:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "Perfect, thank you so much for your help.",
      "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:10:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "You\'re welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
      "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:11:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "No, that\'s all. Have a nice day.",
      "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:12:00Z"
    },
    {
      "text": "You too. Goodbye!",
      "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
      "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:13:00Z"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Step 3: Generate free text summary

Now that you have a conversation with messages, you can generate a free text summary.

To generate the summary, provide the id of the conversation.

```javascript
curl -X GET 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/autosummary/v1/free-text-summaries/5544332211' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>'
```

A successful free text summary generation returns 200 and the summary.

```javascript
{
  "conversationId": "5544332211",
  "summaryId": "0992d936-ff70-49fc-ac88-76f1246d8t27",
  "summaryText": "The customer inquired about the status of a payout for an approved claim. The agent confirmed that the claim was approved and the payout has been processed and will be credited within 3-5 business days."
}
```

This summary is for the entire conversation, regardless of the number of agents.

## Multi-leg summaries

You may have a conversation where one end user talks to multiple agents about different topics. With AutoSummary, you can generate summaries for a conversation based on which agent you want to summarize.

To generate a summary for one leg, provide the id of the conversation in the path, and the agent id as a query parameter.

```javascript
curl -X GET 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/autosummary/v1/free-text-summaries/5544332211?agentExternalId=agent_1234 \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>'
```

This generates a summary for the conversation, only for the parts of conversation that specific agent participated in.

## Customization

AutoSummary allows for extensive customization for the free text summary to meet your specific needs. Whether you want to highlight particular aspects of conversations or adhere to industry-specific standards, this feature provides the flexibility to tailor summaries in a way that aligns with your operational goals.

To customize your free text summaries, work with your ASAPP account team to refine what you want from your summaries.

As an example, using the sample conversation, you may want summaries to be specific about dates and amounts mentioned. Here is an example with that customization:

> The customer inquired about the status of a payout for an approved claim. The agent confirmed that the claim was approved on **June 10, 2024**, for **\$5,000**, and the payout has been processed and will be credited within 3-5 business days.

    <Card horizontal={true} title="Salesforce Plugin" href="/autosummary/salesforce-plugin">Learn how to use the Salesforce Plugin</Card>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

The following instructions cover the **API (Real Time) Integration** as it is the most common method.

To use AutoSummary via API:

1. Provide transcripts
2. Extract insights with AutoSummary API

## Before you Begin

Before you start integrating AutoSummary, you need to:

* Get your API Key Id and Secret
* Ensure your account and API key have been configured to access AutoSummary. Reach out to your ASAPP team if you are unsure.

## Step 1: Provide transcripts

How you provide transcripts depends on the conversation channel.

**For digital channels:**

* Use the **conversation API** to upload the messages directly.

**For voice channels:**

* Use **AutoTranscribe** Service to transcribe the audio, or
* Upload utterances via Conversation API if using your own transcription service.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Conversation API">
    To send transcripts via Conversation API, you need to

    1. Create a `conversation`.
    2. Add `messages` to the `conversation`.

    To create a `conversation`. Provide your Ids for the conversation and customer.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations' \
    --header 'asapp-api-id: \<API KEY ID\>' \
    --header 'asapp-api-secret: \<API TOKEN\>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{ 
      "externalId": "\[Your id for the conversation\]",
      "customer": {   
        "externalId": "\[Your id for the customer\]",
        "name": "customer name" 
      },
      "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
    }'
    ```

    This conversation represents a thread of messages between an end user and one or more agents. A successfully created conversation returns a status code of 200 and the `id` of the conversation.

    ```json
    {"id":"01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM"}
    ```

    Each time your end user or an agent sends a message, you need to add the messages of the conversation by creating a `message` on the `conversation`. This may either be the chat messages in digital channels, or the audio transcript from your transcription service.

    You have the choice to add a **single message** for each turn of the conversation, or can upload a **batch of messages** a conversation.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Single message">
        ```bash
        curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations/01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM/messages' \
        --header 'asapp-api-id: \<API KEY ID\>' \
        --header 'asapp-api-secret: \<API TOKEN\>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{ 
          "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
          "sender": {   
            "role": "customer",
            "externalId": "\[Your id for the customer\]" 
          },
          "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
        }'
        ```

        A successfully created message returns a status code of 200 and the id of the message.

        <Warning>We only show one message as an example, though you would create many messages over the source of the conversation.</Warning>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Batched messages">
        Use the `/messages/batch` endpoint to send multiple messages at once for a given conversation.

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Autotranscribe">
    AutoTranscribe converts audio streams into real-time transcripts. Regardless of the platform you use:

    1. AutoTranscribe generates a `conversation` object for each transcribed interaction.
    2. You'll receive a unique `conversation` id.
    3. Use this `conversation` id to extract insights via the AutoSummary API.

    Platform-specific integration steps vary. Refer to the AutoTranscribe documentation for detailed instructions for your chosen platform.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Extract Insight

AutoSummary offers three types of insights, each with its own API endpoint:

* **Free text summary**
* **Insight**
* **Structured Data**

All APIs require the conversation ID to extract the relevant insight.

### Example: Generate a free text summary

To generate a free text summary, use the following API call:

```javascript
curl -X GET 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/autosummary/v1/free-text-summaries/[conversationId]' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>'
```

A successful free text summary generation returns 200 and the summary

```javascript
{
  "conversationId": "5544332211",
  "summaryId": "0992d936-ff70-49fc-ac88-76f1246d8t27",
  "summaryText": "Customer called in saying their internet was slow. Customer wasn't home so couldn't run a speed test. Agent recommended calling back once they could run the speed test."
}
```

# Intent
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autosummary/intent

Generate intents from your conversations

An intent is a topic-level descriptor-a single world or short phrase-that reflects the customer's main issue or question at the beginning of a conversation.

Intents come out-of-the-box with support for common intents, but can be customized to match your unique use cases.

Intents enable you to optimize operations by analyzing contact reasons, better route conversations, and contribute to your larger analyzing activities.

## How it works

To help understand how intent identification works, let's use an example conversation:

> **Agent**: Hello, thank you for contacting XYZ Insurance. How can I assist you today?\
> **Customer**: Hi, I want to check the status of my payout for my claim.\
> **Agent**: Sure, can you please provide me with the claim number?\
> **Customer**: It's H123456789.\
> **Agent**: Thank you. Could you also provide the last 4 digits of your account number?\
> **Customer**: 6789\
> **Agent**: Let me check the details for you. One moment, please.\
> **Agent**: I see that your claim was approved on June 10, 2024, for \$5000. The payout has been processed.\
> **Customer**: Great! When will I receive the money? /autosummary/getting-started#salesforce-plugin
> **Agent**: The payout will be credited to your account within 3-5 business days.\
> **Customer**: Perfect, thank you so much for your help.\
> **Agent**: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?\
> **Customer**: No, that's all. Have a nice day.\
> **Agent**: You too. Goodbye!

AutoSummary analyzes the conversation, focusing primarily on the initial exchanges, to determine the customer's main reason for contact. This is represented by the `name` of the intent and the `code`, a machine readable identifier for that intent.

In this case, the intent might be identified as:

```javascript
{
  "code": "Payouts",
  "name": "Payouts"
}
```

The intent is determined based on the customer's initial statement about checking the status of their payout, which is the primary reason for their contact.

## Generate an Intent

To generate an intent, provide the conversation transcript to ASAPP.

This example uses our **Conversation API** to provide the transcript, but you have options to use [AutoTranscribe](/autotranscribe) integration if you have voice conversations you want to send to ASAPP.

### Step 1: Create a conversation

To create a `conversation`, provide your IDs for the conversation and customer.

```javascript
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "externalId": "[Your id for the conversation]",
  "customer": {
    "externalId": "[Your id for the customer]",
    "name": "customer name"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
}'
```

A successfully created conversation returns a status code of 200 and a conversation ID.

### Step 2: Add messages

You need to add the messages for the conversation.

You have the choice to add a **single message** for each turn of the conversation, or can upload a **batch of messages** a conversation.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single message">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations/01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM/messages' \
    --header 'asapp-api-id: \<API KEY ID\>' \
    --header 'asapp-api-secret: \<API TOKEN\>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{ 
      "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
      "sender": {   
        "role": "customer",
        "externalId": "\[Your id for the customer\]" 
      },
      "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
    }'
    ```

    A successfully created message returns a status code of 200 and the id of the message.

    <Warning>We only show one message as an example, though you would create many messages over the source of the conversation.</Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Batched messages">
    Use the `/messages/batch` endpoint to send multiple messages at once for a given conversation.

    ```javascript
    curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations/5544332211/messages/batch' \
    --header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
    --header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "messages": [
        {
          "text": "Hello, thank you for contacting XYZ Insurance. How can I assist you today?",
          "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:00:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "Hi, I want to check the status of my payout for my claim.",
          "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:01:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "Sure, can you please provide me with the claim number?",
          "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:02:00Z"

          "text": "It\'s H123456789.",
          "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:03:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "Thank you. Could you also provide the last 4 digits of your account number?",
          "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:04:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "****",
          "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:05:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "Let me check the details for you. One moment, please.",
          "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:06:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "I see that your claim was approved on June 10, ****, for ****. The payout has been processed.",
          "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:07:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "Great! When will I receive the money?",
          "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:08:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "The payout will be credited to your account within 3-5 business days.",
          "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:09:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "Perfect, thank you so much for your help.",
          "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:10:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "You\'re welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
          "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:11:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "No, that\'s all. Have a nice day.",
          "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:12:00Z"
        },
        {
          "text": "You too. Goodbye!",
          "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
          "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:13:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Generate Intent

With a conversation containing messages, you can generate an intent.

To generate the intent, provide the ID of the conversation:

```javascript
curl -X GET 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/autosummary/v1/intent/5544332211' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>'
```

A successful intent generation returns 200 and the intent:

```javascript
{
  "conversationId": "5544332211",
  "intent": {
    "code": "Payouts",
    "name": "Payouts"
  }
}
```

This intent represents the primary reason for the customer's contact, regardless of the number of agents involved in the conversation.

## Customization

AutoSummary allows for extensive customization of the intent identification to meet your specific needs. Whether you want to use industry-specific intents or adhere to your company's unique categorization, this feature provides the flexibility to tailor intents in a way that aligns with your operational goals.

To customize your intents, you can use the Self-Service Configuration tool in ASAPP's AI Console. This tool allows you to:

1. Upload, create, or modify intent labels
2. Expand intent classifications by adding as many intents as needed
3. Configure the system to align with your specific operational requirements

For more advanced customization, work with your ASAPP account team to refine and implement a custom set of intents that perfectly suit your business needs.

### Procedure

There are two parts to the AutoSummary setup process. Use the links below to skip to information about a specific part of the process:

1. [Configure the Salesforce organization](#1-configure-the-salesforce-organization-centrally-35766 "1. Configure the Salesforce Organization Centrally") centrally using an administrator account
2. [Setup agent/user authentication](#2-set-up-single-sign-on-sso-user-authentication-35766 "2. Set Up Single Sign-On (SSO) User Authentication") through the existing single sign-on (SSO) service

<Tip>
  Expected effort for each part of the setup process:

  * 1 hour for installation and configuration of the ASAPP chat components
  * 1-2 hours to enable user authentication, depending on SSO system complexity
</Tip>

  </Frame>
* Click on the **Save** button to apply the changes.
  These configuration steps add the AutoSummary field to the Chat Transcript object. From this point forward, you may use this summary field as part of your agent-facing or internal summary data use case. A common use case is to display this field to the agent in the Record Detail widget.
  **5. Add Record Detail Widget (OPTIONAL)**
* If the Record Detail widget is not already on the Chat Transcript page, drag the **Record Detail** widget from the left panel and place it on the page.
* Click on the **Save** button to apply the changes.
* Refresh the page to see the changes applied to the page.
  The AutoSummary field should now be visible under the **Transcription** section of the Record Detail widget. Once the conversation is ended, summarization will be displayed in this newly configured field in the Record Detail widget.

#### 2. Set Up Single Sign-On (SSO) User Authentication

ASAPP handles authentication through the customer's SSO service to confirm the identity of the agent.

ASAPP acts as the Service Provider (SP) with the customer acting as the Identity Provider (IDP). The customer's authentication system performs user authentication using their existing user credentials.

ASAPP supports SP-initiated SSO with either OIDC (preferred method) and SAML. Once the user initiates sign-in, ASAPP detects that the user is authenticated and requests an assertion from the customer's SSO service.

**Configuration Steps for OIDC (preferred method)**

1. Create a new IDP OIDC application with type `Web`
2. Set the following attributes for the app:

   | Attribute             | Value\*                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Grant Type            | authorization code                                                                                                                                                                 |
   | Sign-in Redirect URIs | <ul><li>Production: `https://api.asapp.com/auth/v1/callback/{company_marker}`</li><li>Sandbox: `https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/auth/v1/callback/{company_marker}-sandbox`</li></ul> |

   <Note> ASAPP to provide `company_marker` value</Note>
3. Save the application and send ASAPP the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the app through a secure communication channel
4. Set scopes for the OIDC application:
   * Required: `openid`
   * Preferred: `email`, `profile`
5. Tell ASAPP which end-user attribute should be used a unique identifier
6. Tell ASAPP your IDP domain name
   **Configuration Steps for SAML**
7. Create a new IDP SAML application.
8. Set the following attributes for the app:

   | Attribute            | Value\*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Usage

### Customization

#### Historical Transcripts for Summary Model Customization

ASAPP uses past agent conversations to generate a customized summary model that is tailored to a given use case. In order to create a customized summary model, ASAPP requires a minimum of 500 representative historical transcripts to generate free-text summaries. Transcripts should identify both the agent and customer messages.

<Note>
  Proper transcript formatting and sampling ensures data is usable for model training. Please ensure transcripts conform to the following:
  **Formatting**

  * Each utterance is clearly demarcated and sent by one identified sender
  * Utterances are in chronological order and complete, from beginning to very end of the conversation
  * Where possible, transcripts include the full content of the conversation rather than an abbreviated version. For example, in a digital messaging conversation:
    <table class="informaltable frame-void rules-rows">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th class="th"><p>Full</p></th>
          <th class="th"><p>Abbreviated</p></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="td">
            <p><strong>Agent</strong>: Choose an option from the list below</p>
            <p><strong>Agent</strong>: (A) 1-way ticket (B) 2-way ticket (C) None of the above</p>
            <p><strong>Customer</strong>: (A) 1-way ticket</p>
          </td>

          <td class="td">
            <p><strong>Agent</strong>: Choose an option from the list below</p>
            <p><strong>Customer</strong>: (A)</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  **Sampling**

  * Transcripts are from a wide range of dates to avoid seasonality effects; random sampling over a 12-month period is recommended
  * Transcripts mimic the production conversations on which models will be used - same types of participants, same channel (voice, messaging), same business unit
  * There are no duplicate transcripts
</Note>

For more information on how to transmit the conversation data, reach out to your ASAPP account contact.
Visit [Transmitting Data to SFTP](/reporting/send-sftp) for instructions on how to send historical transcripts to ASAPP.

#### Conversation Redaction

When message text in the conversation transcript is sent to ASAPP, ASAPP applies redaction to the message text to prevent transmission of sensitive information. Reach out to your ASAPP account contact for information on available redaction capabilities to configure for your implementation.

### Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission from first user authentication, to secure communications, to our auditing and logging system, all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in the data logging system. Access to data by ASAPP teams is tightly constrained and monitored. Strict security protocols protect both ASAPP and our customers.
The following security controls are particularly relevant to AutoCompose:

1. Client sessions are controlled using a time-limited authorization token. Privileges for each active session are controlled server-side to mitigate potential elevation-of-privilege and information disclosure risks.
2. To avoid unauthorized disclosure of information, unique, non-guessable IDs are used to identify conversations. These conversations can only be accessed using a valid client session.
3. Requests to API endpoints that can potentially receive sensitive data are put through a round of redaction to strip the request of sensitive data (like SSNs and phone numbers).

# Structured Data
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autosummary/structured-data

Extract entities and targeted data from your conversations

Structured data is specific, customizable data points extracted from a conversation. This feature encompasses to main components:

* **Entity extraction**: Automatically identifies and extracts specific pieces of information.
* **Question extraction (Targeted Structured Data)**: Answers predefined questions based on the conversation content.

Entity and Question structured data comes out of the box with entities and questions based per industry, but can be [customized](#customization) to match your unique use cases.

The dynamic nature of structure data makes them capable of solving an endless list of challenges, but may help you with:

* Automating data collection for analytics and reporting
* Facilitating compliance monitoring and quality assurance
* Rapid population of CRMs and other business tools
* Supporting data-driven decision making and process improvement

## How it works

To illustrate how Structured Data works, let's use an example conversation:

> **Agent**: Hello, thank you for contacting XYZ Insurance. How can I assist you today?\
> **Customer**: Hi, I want to check the status of my payout for my claim.\
> **Agent**: Sure, can you please provide me with the claim number?\
> **Customer**: It's H123456789.\
> **Agent**: Thank you. Could you also provide the last 4 digits of your account number?\
> **Customer**: 6789\
> **Agent**: Let me check the details for you. One moment, please.\
> **Agent**: I see that your claim was approved on June 10, 2024, for \$5000. The payout has been processed.\
> **Customer**: Great! When will I receive the money?\
> **Agent**: The payout will be credited to your account within 3-5 business days.\
> **Customer**: Perfect, thank you so much for your help.\
> **Agent**: You’re welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?\
> **Customer**: No, that's all. Have a nice day.\
> **Agent**: You too. Goodbye!

AutoSummary analyzes this conversation and extracts structured data in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Entity">
    Entity Extraction automatically identifies and extracts specific pieces of information from the conversation. These entities can include things like claim numbers, account details, dates, monetary amounts, and more.

    For our example conversation, the extracted entities might look like this:

    ```javascript
    [
        {
          "name": "Claim Number",
          "value": "H123456789"
        },
        {
          "name": "Account Number Last 4",
          "value": "5678"
        },
        {
          "name": "Approval Date",
          "value": "2024-06-10"
        },
        {
          "name": "Payout Amount",
          "value": 5000
        }
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Question">
    Targeted Structured Data, or Questions, allows you to get answers to predefined queries based on the conversation content. These questions can be customized to address specific aspects of customer interactions, compliance requirements, or any other relevant factors.

    For our example conversation, some predefined questions and their answers might look like this:

    ```javascript
    [
        {
          "name": "Customer Satisfied",
          "answer": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "Name": "Payout Information Provided",
          "answer": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "name": "Verification Completed",
          "answer": "Yes"
        }
    ]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Generate Structured Data

To generate Structured Data, you first need to provide the conversation transcript to ASAPP.

This example uses our **Conversation API** to provide the transcript, but you have options to use [AutoTranscribe](/autotranscribe) integration if you have voice conversations you want to send to ASAPP.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Configure your structured data fields">
    You need to configure your structured data fields first.

    Work with your ASAPP account team to determine whether one of our out-of-the-box configurations work for you, or if you need to create custom structured data.

    <Note>
      You can also use our APIs to [customize your structured data fields](#customization).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Create a conversation">
    To create a `conversation`, provide your IDs for the conversation and customer.

    ```javascript
    curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations' \
    --header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
    --header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "externalId": "[Your id for the conversation]",
      "customer": {
        "externalId": "[Your id for the customer]",
        "name": "customer name"
      },
      "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
    }'
    ```

    A successfully created conversation returns a status code of 200 and a conversation ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Add messages">
    You need to add the messages for the conversation. You have the choice to add a **single message** for each turn of the conversation, or can upload a **batch of messages** a conversation.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Single message">
        ```bash
        curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations/01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM/messages' \
        --header 'asapp-api-id: \<API KEY ID\>' \
        --header 'asapp-api-secret: \<API TOKEN\>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{ 
          "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
          "sender": {   
            "role": "customer",
            "externalId": "\[Your id for the customer\]" 
          },
          "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
        }'
        ```

        A successfully created message returns a status code of 200 and the id of the message.

        <Warning>We only show one message as an example, though you would create many messages over the source of the conversation.</Warning>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Batched messages">
        Use the `/messages/batch` endpoint to send multiple messages at once for a given conversation.

        ```javascript
        curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations/5544332211/messages/batch' \
        --header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
        --header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
          "messages": [
            {
              "text": "Hello, thank you for contacting XYZ Insurance. How can I assist you today?",
              "sender": {"role": "agent", "externalId": "agent_1234"},
              "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:00:00Z"
            },
            {
              "text": "Hi, I want to check the status of my payout for my claim.",
              "sender": {"role": "customer", "externalId": "cust_1234"},
              "timestamp": "2024-09-09T10:01:00Z"
            },

    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Generate Structured Data">
    With a conversation containing messages, you can generate Structured Data.

    To generate the Structured Data, provide the ID of the conversation:

    ```javascript
    curl -X GET 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/autosummary/v1/structured-data/5544332211' \
    --header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
    --header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>'
    ```

    A successful Structured Data generation returns 200 and the extracted data:

    ```javascript
    {
      "conversationId": "01GCS2XA9447BCQANJF2SXXVA0",
      "id": "0083d936-ff70-49fc-ac19-74f1246d8b27",
      "structuredDataMetrics": [
        {
          "name": "Claim Number",
          "value": "H123456789"
        },
        {
          "name": "Account Number Last 4",
          "value": "5678"
        },
        {
          "name": "Approval Date",
          "value": "2024-06-10"
        },
        {
          "name": "Payout Amount",
          "value": 5000
        },
        {
          "name": "Customer Satisfied",
          "answer": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "name": "Payout Information Provided",
          "answer": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "name": "Verification Completed",
          "answer": "Yes"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    The structured data represents both the entities and answered questions you have configured.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customization

Structured Data questions and entities are fully customizable according to your business needs.

We have a list of potential questions and entities per industry that you can start with. Work with your ASAPP account team to determine whether one of our out-of-the-box configurations work for you, or if you need to create custom structured data.

We offer [APIs to self-serve custom structured data fields](/autosummary/structured-data/segments-and-customization).


# Segments and Customization
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autosummary/structured-data/segments-and-customization

Learn how to customize the data extracted with Structured Data.

Each business has unique needs and requirement for the type of data they want to extract from their conversations.

We offer out of the box configuration for common use cases but also offer two sets of APIs to for you customize the structured data yourself:

* Create custom `structured data fields` to expand the types of data you can extract.
* Create `segments` to customize which sets of structured data are extracted for a defined type of conversation.

## Before you Begin

Before you start integrating to Custom Structured Data Fields and Segments, you need to:

* [Get your API Key Id and Secret](/getting-started/developers)
* Ensure your API key has been configured to access AutoSummary Configuration APIs. Reach out to your ASAPP team if you unsure.

## Custom Structured Data Fields

Each structured data you extract is defined by a `structured-data-field`. You would have an initial set of structured data fields set up for you by ASAPP, but you can also query and create custom structured data fields yourself.

To create a custom structured data field, you need to create a new [`structured-data-field`](/apis/configuration/structured-data-fields/create-structured-data-field) object with the following fields:

* `id`: Your unique identifier for the structured data field. Must begin with `q_` or `e_`.
* `name`: The name of the structured data field.
* `categoryId`: The category of the structured data field. Must be either **OUTCOME** or **CUSTOM**.
* `type`: The type of the structured data field. Must be either **QUESTION** or **ENTITY**.
* `question`: The question that will be answered using the context of the conversation.
* `active`: Whether the structured data field is active.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/configuration/v1/structured-data-fields \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'asapp-api-id: <api-key>' \
  --header 'asapp-api-secret: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "id": "q_promotion_was_offered",
  "name": "Promotion was offered",
  "categoryId": "OUTCOME",
  "type": "QUESTION",
  "question": {
    "question": "Did the agent offer the correct promotion?"
  },
  "active": true
}'
```

A successfully created structured data field will return a `200` and the newly created `structured-data-field` object in the response body.

```json
{
  "id": "q_promotion_was_offered",
  "name": "Promotion was offered",
  "categoryId": "OUTCOME",
  "type": "QUESTION",
  "question": {
    "question": "Did the agent offer the correct promotion?"
  },
  "active": true
}
```

<Note>
  An inactive structured data field will not be extracted from conversations.
</Note>

You can then use the structured data field id to create a segment.

## Segments

Segments are used to configure which sets of structured data fields are extracted for a defined type of conversation. Segments are defined by two parts:

* A **query** that matches against the conversation metadata and intent.
* A list of **structured data field ids** that are included in the segment.

When you generate structured data for a conversation, the system follows these steps:

1. Checks the conversation against the queries of all segments
2. For each matching query:
   * Extracts the structured data fields defined in that segment
3. If multiple segments match:
   * Combines and extracts all structured data fields from all matching segments

<Note>
  By default, there is a [**GLOBAL** segment](#global-segment) that represents the initially configured structured data fields with a query that matches TRUE on any conversation.
</Note>

Most companies will want to create custom segments to extract structured data fields for specific types of conversations, such as a support call involving a specific product or service, or types of sales calls.

### Create a new segment

To create a new segment, you need to create a new [`segment`](/apis/configuration/segments/create-segment) object with the following fields:

* `id`: Your unique identifier for the segment.
* `name`: The name of the segment.
* `query`: The [query](#query) that defines which conversations are included in the segment.
* `structuredDataFieldIds`: The list of structured data field ids that are included in the segment.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/configuration/v1/segments \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'asapp-api-id: <api-key>' \
  --header 'asapp-api-secret: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "id": "USER_SUPPORT",
  "name": "Support",
  "query": {
    "type": "raw",
    "raw": "TRUE"
  },
  "structuredDataFieldIds": [
    "q_promotion_was_offered",
    "e_promotion_details"
  ]
}'
```

A successfully created segment will return a 200 and the newly created segment object in the response body.

```json
{
  "id": "USER_SUPPORT",
  "name": "Support",
  "query": {
    "type": "raw",
    "raw": "TRUE"
  },
  "structuredDataFieldIds": [
    "q_promotion_was_offered",
    "e_promotion_details"
  ]
}
```

### Query

The segments query defines rules for when a segment should be applied to a conversation. We currently only support a query type of `raw` that uses a SQL-like syntax with a focused set of operators for clear and precise matching.

The query language supports these key elements:

**Logical Operators**

* `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` - Combine conditions
* Parentheses `()` for grouping and precedence

**Field Comparisons**

* Equality: `field = 'value'`
* List membership: `field IN ['value1', 'value2']`

#### Available Fields

The data you can query against is the conversation metadata as uploaded as part of [metadata ingestion](/reporting/metadata-ingestion).

Specifically, you can query against the following fields:

**Conversation Metadata**

| ------------ | ----------------- |
| intent\_code | Intent identifier |
| intent\_name | Intent name       |

#### Query Examples

Here are some examples of how queries can be constructed for different types of conversations.

Note that the field values used in these examples are arbitrary and for illustration purposes only. You will need to construct queries using your actual metadata fields and values based on your business needs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match conversations for mobile products AND the iOS platform">
    ```sql
    group_id IN ['mobile_support', 'mobile_tech'] AND platform = 'ios'
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match conversations for up-sell and cross-sell opportunities">
    ```sql
    intent_code IN ['UPGRADE_INQUIRY', 'ADDITIONAL_SERVICE', 'PREMIUM_FEATURES'] 
    AND company_subdivision = 'inside_sales'
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match high-priority complaints">
    ```sql
    intent_code = 'COMPLAINT' AND campaign = 'holiday_season' AND business_rule = 'high_priority'
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match billing conversations for wireless and broadband services">
    ```sql
    intent_code = 'BILLING' AND lob_id IN ['wireless_service', 'broadband_service']
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Global Segment

The **GLOBAL** segment is a special segment that matches all conversations. It is automatically created when you first configure your structured data fields.

You can update the **GLOBAL** segment to include new structured data fields or modify the query to change the criteria for matching conversations.

We recommend that once you start creating custom segments, you update the **GLOBAL** segment to remove the structured data fields and rely on the custom segments to extract structured data.

Transcribe your audio with best in class accuracy

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/autotranscribe/autotranscribe-home.png" />
</Frame>

ASAPP AutoTranscribe converts speech to text in real-time for live call audio streams and audio recordings.

Use AutoTranscribe for voice interactions between contact center agents and their customers, in support of a broad range of use cases including real-time guidance, topical analysis, coaching, and quality management

ASAPP's AutoTranscribe service is powered by a speech recognition model that transforms spoken form to written forms in real-time, along with punctuation and capitalization. To optimize performance, the model can be customized to support domain-specific needs by training on historical call audio and adding custom vocabulary to further boost recognition accuracy.

## How it Works

ASAPP's AutoTranscribe service is powered by a speech recognition model that transforms spoken form to written forms in real-time, along with punctuation and capitalization.

To optimize performance, the model can be customized to support domain-specific needs by training on historical call audio and adding custom vocabulary to further boost recognition accuracy

AutoTranscribe was also designed to be fast enough to show an agent what was said immediately after every utterance.

AutoTranscribe can be implemented in three main integration patterns:

1. **WebSocket API**: All audio streaming, call signaling, and returned transcripts use a WebSocket API, preceded by an authentication mechanism using a REST API.
2. **IPREC Media Gateway**: Audio streaming sent to ASAPP media gateway and call signaling sent via a dedicated API; transcripts are returned either in real-time or post call.
3. **Third Party CCaaS**: Audio is sent to ASAPP media gateway by a third party contact center as a service (CCaaS) vendor and call signaling sent via API; transcripts are returned either in real-time or post call.

# Deploying AutoTranscribe for Amazon Connect
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autotranscribe/amazon-connect

Use AutoTranscribe in your Amazon Connect solution

## Overview

This guide covers the **Amazon Connect** solution pattern, which consists of the following components to receive speech audio and call signals, and return call transcripts:

* Media gateways for receiving call audio from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams
* Start/Stop API for Lambda functions to provide call data and signals for when to start and stop transcribing call audio

<Note>
  ASAPP can also accept requests to start and stop transcription via API from other call-state aware services. AWS Lambda functions are the approach outlined in this guide.
</Note>

* Required AWS IAM role to allow access to Kinesis Video Streams
* Webhook to POST real-time transcripts to a designated URL of your choosing, alongside two additional APIs to retrieve transcripts after-call

ASAPP works with you to understand your current telephony infrastructure and ecosystem.

Your ASAPP account team will also determine the main use case(s) for the transcript data to determine where and how call transcripts should be sent.

</Frame>

### Integration Steps

There are five parts of the integration process:

1. Setup Authentication for Kineses Video Streams
2. Enable Audio Streaming to Kinesis Video Streams
3. Add Start Media and Stop Media To Flows
4. Send Start and Stop Requests to ASAPP
5. Receive Transcript Outputs

### Requirements

**Audio Stream Codec**

AWS Kinesis Video Streams provides MKV format, which is supported by ASAPP.  No modification or additional transcoding is needed when forking audio to ASAPP.

<Note>
  When supplying recorded audio to ASAPP for AutoTranscribe model training prior to implementation, send uncompressed .WAV media files with speaker-separated channels.
</Note>

Recordings for training should have a sample rate of 8000 and 16-bit PCM audio encoding.

See the [Customization section of the AutoTranscribe Product Guide](/autotranscribe/product-guide#customization) for more on data requirements for transcription model training.

**Developer Portal**

ASAPP provides an AI Services [Developer Portal](/getting-started/developers). Within the portal, developers can do the following:

* Access relevant API documentation (e.g. OpenAPI reference schemas)
* Access API keys for authorization
* Manage user accounts and apps

<Tip>
  Visit the [Get Started](/getting-started/developers) for instructions on creating a developer account, managing teams and apps, and setup for using AI Service APIs.
</Tip>

## Integrate with Amazon Connect

### 1. Setup Authentication for Kineses Video Streams

The audio streams for Amazon Connect are stored in the Amazon Kinesis Video Streams service in your AWS account where the Amazon Connect instance resides. The access to the Kinesis Video Streams service is [controlled by IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/how-iam).

ASAPP will use [IAM Roles for Service accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts) to receive a specific IAM role in the ASAPP account, for example `asapp-prod-mg-amazonconnect-role`.

Setup your account's IAM role (e.g., `kinesis-connect-access-role-for-asapp`) to trust `asapp-prod-mg-amazonconnect-role` to assume it and create a policy permitting list/read operations on appropriate Kinesis Video Streams associated with Amazon Connect instance.

### 2. Enable Audio Streaming to Kinesis Video Streams

ASAPP retrieves streaming audio by sending requests to Kineses Video Streams. Streaming media is not enabled by default and must be turned on manually.

Enable live media streaming for applicable instances in your Amazon Connect console to ensure audio is available when ASAPP sends requests to Kinesis Video Streams.

<Note>
  If you choose to use a non-default KMS key, ensure that the IAM role for Service Accounts (IRSA) created for ASAPP has access to this KMS key.

  Amazon provides [documentation to guide enabling live media streaming to Kinesis Video Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/enable-live-media-streams).
</Note>

### 3. Add Start Media and Stop Media To Flows

Sending streaming media to Kinesis Video Streams is initiated and stopped by inserting preset blocks - called **Start media streaming** and **Stop media streaming** - into Amazon Connect flows. Place these blocks into your flows to programmatically set when media will be streamed and stopped - this determines what audio will be available for transcription

Typically for ASAPP, audio streaming begins as close as possible to when the agent is assigned. Audio streaming typically stops ahead of parts of calls that should not be transcribed such as holds, transfers, and post-call surveys.

<Note>
  When placing the **Start media streaming** block, ensure **From the customer** and **To the customer** menu boxes are checked so that both participants' call media streams are available for transcription.
</Note>

Amazon provides [documentation on adding Start media streaming and Stop media streaming blocks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/use-media-streams-blocks) to Amazon Connect flows.

### 4. Send Start and Stop Requests to ASAPP

AWS Lambda functions can be inserted into Amazon Connect flows in order to send requests directly to ASAPP APIs to start and stop transcription.

<Note>
  ASAPP can also accept requests to start and stop transcription via API from other call-state aware services. If you are using another service to interact with ASAPP APIs, you can use AWS Lambda functions to send important call metadata to your other services before they send requests to ASAPP.

  The approach outlined in this guide is to call ASAPP APIs directly using AWS Lambda functions.
</Note>

As outlined in [Requirements](#requirements "Requirements"), user accounts must be created in the developer portal in order to enroll apps and receive API keys to interact with ASAPP endpoints.

Lambda functions (or any other service you use to interact with ASAPP APIs) will require these API keys to send requests to start and stop transcription. See the [Endpoints](#endpoints "Endpoints") section to learn how to interact with them, including what's necessary to include in requests to each endpoint.

ASAPP will not begin transcribing call audio until requested to, at which point we will request the audio from Kinesis Video Streams and begin transcribing.

With AWS Kinesis Video streams, there are 2 supported selectorTypes to start-streaming:

* **NOW**: NOW will start transcribing from the most recent audio data in the Kinesis stream.
* **FRAGMENT\_NUMBER**: FRAGMENT\_NUMBER will require another parameter afterFragmentNumber to be populated and would be the fragment within the media stream to start (for example, the start fragment number to capture all transcripts in the stream prior to start-streaming being called).

<Note>
  The `/start-streaming` endpoint request requires several fields, but three specific attributes must come from Amazon:

  * Amazon Connect Contact Id (multiple possible sources)
    JSONPath formats: `$.ContactId`, `$.InitialContactId`, `$.PreviousContactId`
  * Audio Stream ARN
    JSONPath format: `$.MediaStreams.Customer.Audio.StreamARN`
  * \[OPTIONAL] Start Fragment Number
    JSONPath format: `$.MediaStreams.Customer.Audio.StartFragmentNumber`
    Requests to `/start-streaming` also require agent and customer identifiers. These identifiers can be sourced from Amazon Connect but may also originate from other systems if your use case requires it.
</Note>

Stop requests are used to pause or end transcription for any needed reason. For example, a stop request could be used when the agent initiates a transfer to another agent or queue or at the end of the call to prevent transcribing post-call interactions such as satisfaction surveys.

<Note>
  AutoTranscribe is only meant to transcribe conversations between customers and agents - start and stop requests should be implemented to ensure non-conversation audio (e.g. hold music, IVR menus, surveys) is not being transcribed. Attempted transcription of non-conversation audio will negatively impact other services meant to consume conversation transcripts, such as ASAPP AutoSummary.
</Note>

#### Adding Lambda Functions to Flows

First, create and deploy two new Lambda functions in the AWS Lambda console: one for  sending a request to ASAPP's `/start-streaming` endpoint and another for sending a request to ASAPP's `/stop-streaming` endpoint.

<Note>
  Refer to the [API Reference in ASAPP's Developer Portal](/apis/autotranscribe-media-gateway/start-streaming) for detailed specifications for sending requests to each endpoint.
</Note>

Once Lambda functions are deployed and configured, add the Lambda functions to your Amazon Connect instance using the Amazon Connect console. Once added, the Lambda functions will be available for use in your existing applicable flows.

In Amazon Connect's flow tool, add an Invoke **AWS Lambda function** where you want to make a request to ASAPP's APIs.

* For requests to `/start-streaming` endpoint, place the Lambda block following the **Start media streaming** flow block
* For requests to `/stop-streaming` endpoint, place the Lambda block immediately before the **Stop media streaming** flow block.

Amazon provides [documentation on invoking AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-lambda-functions).

### 5. Receive Transcript Outputs

AutoTranscribe outputs transcripts using three separate mechanisms, each corresponding to a different temporal use case:

* **[Real-time](#real-time-via-webhook "Real-Time via Webhook")**: Webhook posts complete utterances to your target endpoint as they are transcribed during the live conversation
* **[After-call](#after-call-via-get-request "After-Call via GET Request")**: GET endpoint responds to your requests for a designated call with the full set of utterances from that completed conversation
* **[Batch](#batch-via-file-exporter "Batch via File Exporter")**: File Exporter service responds to your request for a designated time interval with a link to a data feed file that includes all utterances from that interval's conversations

#### Real-Time via Webhook

ASAPP sends transcript outputs in real-time via HTTPS POST requests to a target URL of your choosing.

Authentication

Once the target is selected, work with your ASAPP account team to implement one of the following supported authentication mechanisms:

* **Custom CAs:** Custom CA certificates for regular TLS (1.2 or above).
* **mTLS:** Mutual TLS using custom certificates provided by the customer.
* **Secrets:** A secret token. The secret name is configurable as is whether it appears in the HTTP header or as a URL parameter.
* **OAuth2 (client\_credentials):** Client credentials to fetch tokens from an authentication server.

Expected Load

Target servers should be able to support receiving transcript POST messages for each utterance of every live conversation on which AutoTranscribe is active.

For reference, an average live call sends approximately 10 messages per minute. At that rate, 50 concurrent live calls represents approximately 8 messages per second.

Please ensure the selected target server is load tested to support anticipated peaks in concurrent call volume.

Transcript Timing and Format

Once you have started transcription for a given call stream using the `/start-streaming` endpoint, AutoTranscribe begins to publish `transcript` messages, each of which contains a full utterance for a single call participant.

The expected latency between when ASAPP receives audio for a completed utterance and provides a transcription of that same utterance is 200-600ms.

<Note>
  Perceived latency will also be influenced by any network delay sending audio to ASAPP and receiving transcription messages in return.
</Note>

Though messages are sent in the order they are transcribed, network latency may impact the order in which they arrive or cause messages to be dropped due to timeouts. Where latency causes timeouts, the oldest pending messages will be dropped first; AutoTranscribe does not retry to deliver dropped messages.

The message body for `transcript` type messages is JSON encoded with these fields:

| Field                  | Subfield   | Description                                                                                                                            | Example Value                        |
| :--------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |

| streamId               |            | Unique identifier assigned by ASAPP to each call participant's stream returned in response to `/start-streaming` and `/stop-streaming` | 5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5 |
| sender                 | externalId | Customer or agent identifier as provided in request to `/start-streaming`                                                              | ef53245                              |
| sender                 | role       | A participant role, either customer or agent                                                                                           | customer, agent                      |
| autotranscribeResponse | message    | Type of message                                                                                                                        | transcript                           |
| autotranscribeResponse | start      | The start ms of the utterance                                                                                                          | 0                                    |
| autotranscribeResponse | end        | Elapsed ms since the start of the utterance                                                                                            | 1000                                 |
| autotranscribeResponse | utterance  | Transcribed utterance text                                                                                                             | Are you there?                       |

Expected `transcript` message format:

```json
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "externalConversationId": "<Amazon Connect Contact Id>",
  "streamId": "<streamId>",
  "sender": {
    "externalId": "<id>",
    "role": "customer",  // or "agent"
  },
  "autotranscribeResponse": {
    "message": "transcript",
    "start": 0,
    "end": 1000,
    "utterance": [
       {"text": "<transcript text>"}
      ]
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Should your target server return an error in response to a POST request, ASAPP will record the error details for the failed message delivery and drop the message.

### After-Call via GET Request

AutoTranscribe makes a full transcript available at the following endpoint for a given completed call:

`GET /conversation/v1/conversation/messages`

Once a conversation is complete, make a request to the endpoint using a conversation identifier and receive back every message in the conversation.

### Message Limit

This endpoint will respond with up to 1,000 transcribed messages per conversation, approximately a two-hour continuous call. All messages are received in a single response without any pagination.

To retrieve all messages for calls that exceed this limit, use either a real-time mechanism or File Exporter for transcript retrieval.

<Note>
  Transcription settings (e.g. language, detailed tokens, redaction), for a given call are set with the Start/Stop API, when call transcription is initiated. All transcripts retrieved after the call will reflect the initially requested settings with the Start/Stop API.
</Note>

See the [Endpoints](#endpoints "Endpoints") section to learn how to interact with this API.

#### Batch via File Exporter

AutoTranscribe makes full transcripts for batches of calls available using the File Exporter service's `utterances` data feed.

The File Exporter service is meant to be used as a batch mechanism for exporting data to your data warehouse, either on a scheduled basis (e.g. nightly, weekly) or for ad hoc analyses. Data that populates feeds for the File Exporter service updates once daily at 2:00AM UTC.

Visit [Retrieving Data from ASAPP Messaging](/reporting/file-exporter) for a guide on how to interact with the File Exporter service.

## Use Case Example

Real-Time Transcription

This real-time transcription use case example consists of an English language call between an agent and customer with redaction enabled, ending with a hold. Note that redaction is enabled by default and does not need to be requested explicitly.

1. When the customer and agent are connected, send ASAPP a request to start transcription for the call:
   **POST** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/start-streaming`
   **Request**

   ```json
   {
     "namespace": "amazonconnect",
     "guid": "8c259fea-8764-4a92-adc4-73572e9cf016",
     "customerId": "TT9833237",
     "agentId": "RE223444211993",
     "autotranscribeParams": {
       "language": "en-US"
     },
     "amazonConnectParams": {
       "streamArn": arn:aws:kinesisvideo:us-east-1:145051540001:stream/streamtest-connect-asappconnect-contact-cccaa6b8-12e4-44a6-90d5-829c4fdf68e4/1696422764859TBD,
       "startSelectorType":"NOW"
     }
   } 
   ```

   **Response**

   *STATUS 200: Router processed the request, details are in the response body*

   ```json
   {
    "isOk": true,
    "autotranscribeResponse": {
      "customer": {
        "streamId": "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
        "status": {
          "code": 1000,
          "description": "OK"
        }
      },
      "agent": {
        "streamId": "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
        "status": {
          "code": 1000,
          "description": "OK"
        }
      }
    }
   }
   ```

2. The agent and customer begin their conversation and separate HTTPS POST `transcript` messages are sent for each participant from ASAPP's webhook publisher to a target endpoint configured to receive the messages.

   HTTPS **POST** for Customer Utterance

   ```json
   {
     type: "transcript",
     externalConversationId: "8c259fea-8764-4a92-adc4-73572e9cf016",
     streamId: "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
     sender: {
       externalId: "TT9833237",
       role: "customer",
     },
     autotranscribeResponse: {
       message: 'transcript',
       start: 400,
       end: 3968,
       utterance: [
          {text: "I need help upgrading my streaming package and my PIN number is ####"}
         ]
     }
   }
   ```

   HTTPS **POST** for Agent Utterance

   ```json
   {
     type: "transcript",
     externalConversationId: "8c259fea-8764-4a92-adc4-73572e9cf016",
     streamId: "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
     sender: {
       externalId: "RE223444211993",
       role: "agent",
     },
     autotranscribeResponse: {
       message: 'transcript',
       start: 4744,
       end: 8031,
       utterance: [
          {text: "Thank you sir, let me pull up your account."}
         ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. Later in the conversation, the agent puts the customer on hold. This triggers a request to the `/stop-streaming` endpoint to pause transcription and prevents hold music and promotional messages from being transcribed.

   **POST** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/stop-streaming`

   **Request**

   ```json
   {
    "namespace": "amazonconnect",
    "guid": "8c259fea-8764-4a92-adc4-73572e9cf016",
   }
   ```

   **Response**

   *STATUS 200: Router processed the request, details are in the response body*

   ```json
   {
    "isOk": true,
    "autotranscribeResponse": {
      "customer": {
        "streamId": "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
        "status": {
          "code": 1000,
          "description": "OK"
        },
        "summary": {
          "totalAudioBytes": 1334720,
          "audioDurationMs": 83420,
          "streamingSeconds": 84,
          "transcripts": 2
        },
      "agent": {
        "streamId": "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
        "status": {
          "code": 1000,
          "description": "OK"
        },
        "summary": {
          "totalAudioBytes": 1334720,
          "audioDurationMs": 83420,
          "streamingSeconds": 84,
          "transcripts": 2
        },
      }
    }
   }
   ```

### Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission, from first user authentication to secure communications to our auditing and logging system (which includes hashing of data in transit) all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in the data logging system. The teams at ASAPP are also under tight restraints in terms of access to data. These security protocols protect both ASAPP and its customers.


# AutoTranscribe via Direct Websocket
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autotranscribe/direct-websocket

Use a websocket URL to send audio media to AutoTranscribe

Your organization can use AutoTranscribe to transcribe voice interactions between contact center agents and their customers, in support of a broad range of use cases including analysis, coaching, and quality management.

ASAPP AutoTranscribe is a streaming speech-to-text transcription service that works both with live streams and with audio recordings of completed calls. Integrating your voice system with GenerativeAgent using the AutoTranscribe Websocket enables real-time communication, allowing for seamless interaction between your voice platform and GenerativeAgent's services.

AutoTranscribe service is powered by a speech recognition model that transforms spoken form to written forms in real-time, along with punctuation and capitalization. To optimize performance, the model can be customized to support domain-specific needs by training on historical call audio and adding custom vocabulary to further boost recognition accuracy.

Some benefits of using Websocket to Stream events include:

* Websocket Connection: Establish a persistent connection between your voice system and the GenerativeAgent server.
* API Streaming: All audio streaming, call signaling, and returned transcripts use a WebSocket API, preceded by an authentication mechanism using a REST API
* Real-time Data Exchange: Messages are exchanged in real time, ensuring quick responses and efficient handling of user queries.
* Bi-directional Communication: Websockets facilitate bi-directional communication, making the interaction smooth and responsive.

### Implementation Steps

1. Step 1: Authenticate with ASAPP
2. Step 2: Open a Connection
3. Step 3: Start an Audio Stream
4. Step 4: Send the Audio Stream
5. Step 5: Receive the free-text Transcriptions from AutoTranscribe
6. Step 6: Stop the Audio Stream

Finalize the audio stream when the conversation is over or escalated to a human agent

### How it works

1. The API Gateway authenticates customer requests and returns a WebSocket URL, which points to the Voice Gateway with secure protocol.
2. The Voice Gateway validates the client connection request, translates public WebSocket API calls to internal protocols and sends live audio streams to the Speech Recognition Server
3. The Redaction Server redacts the transcribed texts with given customizable redaction rules if redaction is requested.
4. The texts are sent to AutoTranscribe so it can analyze and reply back

This guide covers the **WebSocket API** solution pattern, which consists of an API Gateway, Voice Gateway, Speech Recognition Server and Redaction Server, where:

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-943bb07d-59b2-bfc3-921f-1251b8198153.png" />
</Frame>

### Integration Steps

Here's a high level overview of how to work with AutoTranscribe:

1. Authenticate with ASAPP to gain access to the AutoTranscribe API.
2. Establish a WebSocket connection with the ASAPP Voice Gateway.
3. Send a `startStream` message with appropriate feature parameters specified.
4. Once the request is accepted by the ASAPP Voice Gateway, stream audio as binary data.
5. The ASAPP voice server will return transcripts in multiple messages.
6. Once the audio streaming is completed, send a `finishStream` to indicate to the Voice server that there is no more audio to send for this stream request.
7. Upon completion of all audio processing, the server sends a `finalResponse` which contains a summary of the stream request.

### Requirements

**Audio Stream Format**

In order to be transcribed properly, audio sent to ASAPP AutoTranscribe must be in mono or single-channel for each speaker.

Audio is sent as binary format through the WebSocket; the audio encoding (sample rate and encoding format) should be given in the `startStream` message.

For real-time live streaming, ASAPP recommends that you stream audio chunk-by-chunk in a real-time streaming format, by sending every 20ms or 100ms of audio as one binary message and sending the next chunk after a 20ms or 100ms interval.

If the chunk is too small, it will require more audio binary messages and more downstream message handling; if the chunk is too big, it increases buffering pressure and slows down the server responsiveness.

Exceptionally large chunks may result in WebSocket transport errors such as timeouts.

<Note>
  When supplying recorded audio to ASAPP for AutoTranscribe model training prior to implementation, send uncompressed `.WAV` media files with speaker-separated channels.

  Recordings for training and real-time streams should have both the same sample rate (8000 samples/sec) and audio encoding (16-bit PCM).

  See the [Customization section of the AutoTranscribe Product Guide](/autotranscribe/product-guide#customization) for more on data requirements for transcription model training.

**Developer Portal**

ASAPP provides an AI Services [Developer Portal](/getting-started/developers). Within the portal, developers can do the following:

* Access relevant API documentation (e.g. OpenAPI reference schemas)
* Access API keys for authorization
* Manage user accounts and apps

<Tip>
  Visit the [Get Started](/getting-started/developers) for instructions on creating a developer account, managing teams and apps, and setup for using AI Service APIs.

## Step 1 : Authenticate with ASAPP and Obtain an Access URL

<Note>
  All requests to ASAPP sandbox and production APIs must use `HTTPS` protocol. Traffic using `HTTP` will not be redirected to `HTTPS`.
</Note>

The following HTTPS REST API enables authentication with the ASAPP API Gateway:

* `asapp-api-id` and `asapp-api-secret`are required header parameters, both of which will be provided to you by ASAPP.
* A unique conversation ID is recommended to be sent in the request body as `externalId`. ASAPP refers to this identifier from the client's system in real-time streaming use cases to redact utterances using context from other utterances in the same conversation (e.g. reference to a credit card in an utterance from 20s earlier). It is the client's responsibility to ensure `externalId` is unique.

[`POST /autotranscribe/v1/streaming-url`](/apis/autotranscribe/get-streaming-url)

Headers (required)

```json
{
    "asapp-api-id": <asapp provided api id>,
    "asapp-api-secret": <asapp provided api secret>
}
```

Request body (optional)

```json
{
    "externalId": "<unique conversation id>"
}

```

If the authentication succeeds, a secure WebSocket short-lived access URL will be returned in the HTTP response body. Default TTL (time-to-live) for this URL is 5 minutes.

```json
{
    "streamingUrl": "<short-lived access URL>"
}
```

## Step 2: Open a Connection

Before sending any message, create a WebSocket connection with the access URL obtained from previous step:

`wss://<internal-voice-gateway-ingress>?token=<short_lived_access_token>`

A WebSocket connection will be established if the `short_lived_access_token` is validated. Otherwise, the requested connection will be rejected.

## Step 3: Start a stream audio message

AutoTranscribe uses the following message sequence for streaming audio, sending transcripts, and ending streaming:

|    | **Send Your Request**  | **Receive ASAPP Response** |
| :- | :--------------------- | :------------------------- |
| 1  | `startStream` message  | `startResponse` message    |
| 2  | Stream audio           | `transcript` message       |
| 3  | `finishStream` message | `finalResponse` message    |

<Note>
  WebSocket protocol request messages in the sequence must be formatted as text (UTF-8 encoded string data); only the audio stream should be formatted in binary. All response messages will also be formatted as text.
</Note>

### Send startStream message

Once the connection is established, send a `startStream` message with information about the speaker including their `role` (customer, agent) and their unique identifier (`externalId`) from your system before sending any audio packets.

```json
{
   "message":"startStream",
   "sender": {
          "role": "customer",
          "externalId": "JD232442"
   }
}
```

Provide additional [optional fields](#fields-and-parameters) in the `startStream` message to adjust default transcription settings.

For example, the default `language` transcription setting is `en-US` if not denoted in the `startStream` message. To set the language to Spanish, the `language` field should be set with value `es-US`. Once set, AutoTranscribe will expect a Spanish conversation in the audio stream and return transcribed message text in Spanish.

### Receive startResponse message

For any `startStream` message, the server will respond with a `startResponse` if the request is granted:

```json
{
   "message": "startResponse",
   "streamID": "128342213",
   "status": {
          "code": "1000",
          "description": "OK"
   }
}
```

The `streamID` is a unique identifier assigned to the connection by the ASAPP server.

The status code and description may contain additional useful information.

If there is an application status code error with the request, the ASAPP server sends a `finalResponse` message with an error description, and the server then closes the connection.

## Step 4: Send the audio stream

You can start to stream audio as soon as the  `startStream` message is sent without the need to wait for the `startResponse`. However, it is possible a request could be rejected either due to an invalid `startStream` or internal server errors. If that is the case, the server notifies with a `finalResponse` message, and any streamed audio packets will be dropped by the server.

Audio must be sent as binary data of WebSocket protocol:

`ws.send(<binary_blob>)`

The server does not acknowledge receiving individual audio packets. The summary in the `finalResponse` message can be used to verify if any audio packet was not received by the server.

If audio can be transcribed, the server sends back `transcript` messages asynchronously.

For real-time live streaming, it is recommeneded that audio streams are sent chunk-by-chunk, sending every 20ms or 100ms of audio as one binary message. Exceptionally large chunks may result in WebSocket transport errors such as timeouts.

### Receive transcript messages

The server sends back the `transcript` message, which contains one complete utterance.

Example of a `transcript` message:

```json
{
   "message": "transcript",
   "start": 0,
   "end": 1000,
   "utterance":
   [
      {"text": "Hi, my ID is 123."}
   ]
}
```

## Step 5: Receive Transcriptions from AutoTranscribe

Now you must call `GET /messages` to receive all the transcript messages for a completed call.

Conversation transcripts are available for seven days after they are completed.

```json
curl -X GET 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversation/messages' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "externalId": "Your GUID/UCID of the SPIREC Call"
}'

```

A successful response returns a 200 and the Call Transcripts

```json
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "externalConversationId": "<guid>",
  "streamId": "<streamId>",
  "sender": {
    "externalId": "<id>",
    "role": "customer",  // or "agent"
  },
  "autotranscribeResponse": {
    "message": "transcript",
    "start": 0,
    "end": 1000,
    "utterance": [
       {"text": "<transcript text>"}
      ]
  }
}

```

## Step 6: Stop the streaming audio message

### Send finishStream message

When the audio stream is complete, send a `finishStream` message. Any audio message sent after `finishStream` will be dropped by the service.

```json
{
   "message": "finishStream"
}
```

Any other non-audio messages sent after `finishStream` will be dropped, the service will send a `finalResponse` with error code 4056 (Wrong message order) and the connection will be closed.

### Receive finalResponse message

The server sends a `finalResponse` at the end of the streaming session and closes the connection, after which the server will stop processing incoming messages for the stream. It is safe to close the WebSocket connection when the `finalResponse` message is received.

The server will end a given stream session if any of following are true:

* Server receives `finishStream` and all audio received has been processed
* Server detects connection idle timeout (at 60 seconds)
* Server internal errors (unable to recover)
* Request message is invalid (note: if the access token is invalid, the WebSocket will close with a WebSocket error code)
* Critical requested feature is not supported, for example, redaction
* Service maintenance
* Streaming duration over limit (default is 3 hours)

In case of non-application WebSocket errors, the WebSocket layer closes the connection, and the server may not get an opportunity to send a `finalResponse` message.

The `finalResponse`message has a summary of the stream along with the status code, which you can use to verify if there are any missing audio packets or transcript messages:

```json
{
   "message": "finalResponse",
   "streamId": "128342213",
   "status": {
       "code": "1000",
       "description": "OK"
   },
   "summary": {
       "totalAudioBytes": 300,     // number of audio bytes received 
       "audioDurationMs": 6000,    // audio length in milliseconds processed by the server
       "streamingSeconds": 6,
       "transcripts": 10     // number of transcripts recognized
}
```

### Custom Vocabulary

The ASAPP speech server can boost specific word accuracy if a target list of vocabulary words is provided before recognition starts, using an `updateVocabulary` message.

The `updateVocabulary` service can be sent multiple times during a session. Vocabulary is additive, which means the new vocabulary words are appended to the previous ones. If vocabulary is sent in between sent audio packets, it will take into effect only after the end of the current utterance being processed.

All `updateVocabulary` changes are valid only for the current WebSocket session.

The following fields are part of a `updateVocabulary` message:

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Mandatory | Example Syntax                                     |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| phrase     | Phrase which needs to be boosted. Prevent adding longer phrases, instead add them as separate entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Yes       | "IEEE"                                             |
| soundsLike | This provides the ways in which a phrase can be said/pronounced. Certain rules: - Spell out numbers (25 -> 'two five' and/or 'twenty five') - Spell out acronyms (WHO -> 'w h o') - Use lowercase letters for everything - Limit phrases to English and Spanish-language letters (accented consonants and vowels accepted) | No        | "i triple e"                                       |
| category   | Supported Categories: 'address', 'name', 'number'. Categories help the AutoTranscribe service normalize the provided phrase so it can guess certain ways in which a phrase can be pronounced. e.g., '717 N Blvd' with 'address' category will help the service normalize the phrase to 'seven one seven North Boulevard'   | No        | "address", "name", "number", "company", "currency" |

## Retrieving Transcript Data

In addition to real-time transcription messages via WebSocket, AutoTranscribe also can output transcripts through two other mechanisms:

* **After-call**: GET endpoint responds to your requests for a designated call with the full set of utterances from that completed conversation
* **Batch**: File Exporter service responds to your request for a designated time interval with a link to a data feed file that includes all utterances from that interval's conversations

### After-Call via GET Request

[`GET /conversation/v1/conversation/messages`](/apis/messages/list-messages-with-an-externalid)

Use this endpoint to retrieve all the transcript messages for a completed call.

**When to Call**

Once the conversation is complete. Conversation transcripts are available for seven days after they are completed.

<note>
  For conversations that include transfers, the endpoint will provide transcript messages for all call legs that correspond to the call's identifier.
</note>

**Request Details**

Requests must include a call identifier with the GUID/UCID of the SIPREC call.

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with an array of objects, each of which corresponds to a single message. Each object contains the text of the message, the sender's role and identifier, a unique message identifier, and timestamps.

<Tip>
  Transcription settings (e.g. language, detailed tokens, redaction), for a given call are set with [the `startStream` websocket message](#startstream-request-fields), when call transcription is initiated. All transcripts retrieved after the call will reflect the initially requested settings in the `startStream` message.
</Tip>

**Message Limit**

This endpoint will respond with up to 1,000 transcribed messages per conversation, approximately a two-hour continuous call. All messages are received in a single response without any pagination.

To retrieve all messages for calls that exceed this limit, use either a real-time mechanism or File Exporter for transcript retrieval.

### Batch via File Exporter

AutoTranscribe makes full transcripts for batches of calls available using the File Exporter service's `utterances` data feed.

The File Exporter service is meant to be used as a batch mechanism for exporting data to your data warehouse, either on a scheduled basis (e.g. nightly, weekly) or for ad hoc analyses. Data that populates feeds for the File Exporter service updates once daily at 2:00AM UTC.

Visit [Retrieving Data for AI Services](/reporting/file-exporter) for a guide on how to interact with the File Exporter service.


# Deploying AutoTranscribe for Genesys AudioHook
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autotranscribe/genesys-audiohook

Use AutoTranscribe in your Genesys Audiohook application

This guide covers the **Genesys AudioHook Media Gateway** solution pattern, which consists of the following components to receive speech audio and call signals, and return call transcripts:

* Media gateways for receiving call audio from Genesys Cloud
* HTTPS API which enables the customer to POST requests to start and stop call transcription
* Webhook to POST real-time transcripts to a designated URL of your choosing, alongside two additional APIs to retrieve transcripts after-call for one or a batch of conversations

ASAPP works with you to understand your current telephony infrastructure and ecosystem.

Your ASAPP account team will also determine the main use case(s) for the transcript data to determine where and how call transcripts should be sent.

ASAPP then completes the architecture definition, including integration points into the existing infrastructure.

</Frame>

### Integration Steps

There are three steps to integrate AutoTranscribe into Genesys Audiohook:

1. Enable AudioHook and Configure for ASAPP
2. Send Start and Stop Requests
3. Receive Transcript Outputs

### Requirements

**Audio Stream Codec**

Genesys AudioHook provides audio in the mu-law format with 8000 sample rate, which is supported by ASAPP.

No modification or additional transcoding is needed when forking audio to ASAPP.

<Note>
  When supplying recorded audio to ASAPP for AutoTranscribe model training prior to implementation, send uncompressed .WAV media files with speaker-separated channels.
</Note>

Recordings for training should have a sample rate of 8000 and 16-bit PCM audio encoding.

Read the [Customization section of the AutoTranscribe Product Guide](/autotranscribe/product-guide#customization) for more on data requirements for transcription model training.

**Developer Portal**

ASAPP provides an AI Services [Developer Portal](/getting-started/developers). Within the portal, developers can do the following:

* Access relevant API documentation (e.g. OpenAPI reference schemas)
* Access API keys for authorization
* Manage user accounts and apps

<Tip>
  Visit the [Get Started](/getting-started/developers) for instructions on creating a developer account, managing teams and apps, and setup for using AI Service APIs.
</Tip>

## Integrate with Genesys AudioHook

### 1. Enable AudioHook and configure for ASAPP

To enable AudioHook within Genesys:

1. Access Genesys Cloud Admin, navigate to Integrations/Integrations and click "plus" in upper right to add more integrations.
2. Find [AudioHook](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/install-audiohook-monitor-from-genesys-appfoundry/) Monitor and Install.
3. [Configure AudioHook Monitor](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/configure-and-activate-audiohook-monitor-in-genesys-cloud/) Integration, using the Connection URI (i.e. wss\://ws-example.asapp.com/mg-genesysaudiohook-autotranscribe/) and credentials provided by ASAPP.
4. [Enable voice transcription](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/configure-voice-transcription/) on desired trunks and within desired Architect Flows. You do not need to select ASAPP as the transcription engine.

### 2. Send Start and Stop Requests

The `/start-streaming` and `/stop-streaming` endpoints of the Start/Stop API are used to control when transcription occurs for every call media stream (identified by the Genesys conversationId) sent to ASAPP's media gateway. See the [Endpoints](#endpoints) section to learn how to interact with them.

ASAPP will not begin transcribing call audio until requested to, thus preventing transcription of audio at the very beginning of the Genesys AudioHook audio streaming session, which may include IVR, hold music, or queueing.

Stop requests are used to pause or end transcription for any needed reason. For example, a stop request could be used mid-call when the agent places the call on hold or at the end of the call to prevent transcribing post-call interactions such as satisfaction surveys.

<note>
  AutoTranscribe is only meant to transcribe conversations between customers and agents - start and stop requests should be implemented to ensure non-conversation audio (e.g. hold music, IVR menus, surveys) is not being transcribed. Attempted transcription of non-conversation audio will negatively impact other services meant to consume conversation transcripts, such as ASAPP AutoSummary.
</note>

### 3. Receive Transcript Outputs

AutoTranscribe outputs transcripts using three separate mechanisms, each corresponding to a different temporal use case:

* **[Real-time](#real-time-via-webhook)**: Webhook posts complete utterances to your target endpoint as they are transcribed during the live conversation
* **[After-call](#after-call-via-get-request "After-Call via GET Request")**: GET endpoint responds to your requests for a designated call with the full set of utterances from that completed conversation
* **[Batch](#batch-via-file-exporter "Batch via File Exporter")**: File Exporter service responds to your request for a designated time interval with a link to a data feed file that includes all utterances from that interval's conversations

#### Real-Time via Webhook

ASAPP sends transcript outputs in real-time via HTTPS POST requests to a target URL of your choosing.

Authentication

Once the target is selected, work with your ASAPP account team to implement one of the following supported authentication mechanisms:

* **Custom CAs:** Custom CA certificates for regular TLS (1.2 or above).
* **mTLS:** Mutual TLS using custom certificates provided by the customer.
* **Secrets:** A secret token. The secret name is configurable as is whether it appears in the HTTP header or as a URL parameter.
* **OAuth2 (client\_credentials):** Client credentials to fetch tokens from an authentication server.

Expected Load

Target servers should be able to support receiving transcript POST messages for each utterance of every live conversation on which AutoTranscribe is active.

For reference, an average live call sends approximately 10 messages per minute. At that rate, 50 concurrent live calls represents approximately 8 messages per second.

Please ensure the selected target server is load tested to support anticipated peaks in concurrent call volume.

Transcript Timing and Format

Once you have started transcription for a given call stream using the `/start-streaming` endpoint, AutoTranscribe begins to publish `transcript` messages, each of which contains a full utterance for a single call participant.

The expected latency between when ASAPP receives audio for a completed utterance and provides a transcription of that same utterance is 200-600ms.

<Note>
  Perceived latency will also be influenced by any network delay sending audio to ASAPP and receiving transcription messages in return.
</Note>

Though messages are sent in the order they are transcribed, network latency may impact the order in which they arrive or cause messages to be dropped due to timeouts. Where latency causes timeouts, the oldest pending messages will be dropped first; AutoTranscribe does not retry to deliver dropped messages.

The message body for `transcript` type messages is JSON encoded with these fields:

| Field                  | Subfield   | Description                                                                                                                            | Example Value                        |

| autotranscribeResponse | end        | Elapsed ms since the start of the utterance                                                                                            | 1000                                 |

Expected `transcript` message format:

```json
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "externalConversationId": "<conversationId>",
  "streamId": "<streamId>",
  "sender": {
    "externalId": "<id>",
    "role": "customer",  // or "agent"
  },
  "autotranscribeResponse": {
    "message": "transcript",
    "start": 0,
    "end": 1000,
    "utterance": [
       {"text": "<transcript text>"}
      ]
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Should your target server return an error in response to a POST request, ASAPP will record the error details for the failed message delivery and drop the message.

### After-Call via GET Request

AutoTranscribe makes a full transcript available at the following endpoint for a given completed call:

`GET /conversation/v1/conversation/messages`

Once a conversation is complete, make a request to the endpoint using a conversation identifier and receive back every message in the conversation.

Message Limit

This endpoint will respond with up to 1,000 transcribed messages per conversation, approximately a two-hour continuous call. All messages are received in a single response without any pagination.

To retrieve all messages for calls that exceed this limit, use either a real-time mechanism or File Exporter for transcript retrieval.

<Note>
  Transcription settings (e.g. language, detailed tokens, redaction), for a given call are set with the Start/Stop API, when call transcription is initiated. All transcripts retrieved after the call will reflect the initially requested settings with the Start/Stop API.
</Note>

See the [Endpoints](#endpoints) section to learn how to interact with this API.

### Batch via File Exporter

AutoTranscribe makes full transcripts for batches of calls available using the File Exporter service's `utterances` data feed.

The File Exporter service is meant to be used as a batch mechanism for exporting data to your data warehouse, either on a scheduled basis (e.g. nightly, weekly) or for ad hoc analyses. Data that populates feeds for the File Exporter service updates once daily at 2:00AM UTC.

## Use Case Example

Real-Time Transcription

This real-time transcription use case example consists of an English language call between an agent and customer with redaction enabled, ending with a hold. Note that redaction is enabled by default and does not need to be requested explicitly.

1. Ensure the Genesys AudioHook is enabled and configured on the desired trunk and flow.
2. When the customer and agent are connected, send ASAPP a request to start transcription for the call:

   **POST** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/start-streaming`

   **Request**

```json
    {
      "namespace": "genesysaudiohook",
      "guid": "090eaa2f-72fa-480a-83e0-8667ff89c0ec",
      "customerId": "TT9833237",
      "agentId": "RE223444211993",
      "autotranscribeParams": {
        "language": "en-US"
      }
    }  
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Router processed the request, details are in the response body*

```json
    {
     "isOk": true,
     "autotranscribeResponse": {
       "customer": {
         "streamId": "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         }
       },
       "agent": {
         "streamId": "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         }
       }
     }
    }
```

3. The agent and customer begin their conversation and separate HTTPS POST `transcript` messages are sent for each participant from ASAPP's webhook publisher to a target endpoint configured to receive the messages.

   HTTPS **POST** for Customer Utterance

```json
    {
      type: "transcript",
      externalConversationId: "8c259fea-8764-4a92-adc4-73572e9cf016",
      streamId: "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
      sender: {
        externalId: "TT9833237",
        role: "customer",
      },
      autotranscribeResponse: {
        message: 'transcript',
        start: 400,
        end: 3968,
        utterance: [
           {text: "I need help upgrading my streaming package and my PIN number is ####"}
          ]
      }
    }
```

HTTPS **POST** for Agent Utterance

```json
    {
      type: "transcript",
      externalConversationId: "8c259fea-8764-4a92-adc4-73572e9cf016",
      streamId: "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
      sender: {
        externalId: "RE223444211993",
        role: "agent",
      },
      autotranscribeResponse: {
        message: 'transcript',
        start: 4744,
        end: 8031,
        utterance: [
           {text: "Thank you sir, let me pull up your account."}
          ]
      }
    }
```

4. Later in the conversation, the agent puts the customer on hold. This triggers a request to the `/stop-streaming` endpoint to pause transcription and prevents hold music and promotional messages from being transcribed.

   **POST** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/stop-streaming`

   **Request**

```json
    {
     "namespace": "genesysaudiohook",
     "guid": "8c259fea-8764-4a92-adc4-73572e9cf016",
    }
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Router processed the request, details are in the response body*

```json
    {
     "isOk": true,
     "autotranscribeResponse": {
       "customer": {
         "streamId": "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         },
         "summary": {
           "totalAudioBytes": 1334720,
           "audioDurationMs": 83420,
           "streamingSeconds": 84,
           "transcripts": 2
         },
       "agent": {
         "streamId": "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         },
         "summary": {
           "totalAudioBytes": 1334720,
           "audioDurationMs": 83420,
           "streamingSeconds": 84,
           "transcripts": 2
         },
       }
     }
    }
```

### Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission, from first user authentication to secure communications to our auditing and logging system (which includes hashing of data in transit) all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in the data logging system. The teams at ASAPP are also under tight restraints in terms of access to data. These security protocols protect both ASAPP and its customers.

Learn more about the use of AutoTranscribe and its features

## Getting Started

This page provides an overview of the features and functionalities in AutoTranscribe.

After AutoTranscribe is integrated into your applications, you can use all of the configured features.

### Transcription Outputs

AutoTranscribe returns transcriptions as a sequence of utterances with start and end timestamps in response to an audio stream from a single speaker.

As the agent and customer speak, ASAPP's automated speech recognition (ASR) model transcribes their audio streams and returns completed utterances based on the natural pauses from each speaker. The expected latency between when ASAPP receives audio for a completed utterance and provides a transcription of that same utterance is 200-600ms.

<Note>
  Perceived latency will also be influenced by any network delay sending audio to ASAPP and receiving transcription messages in return.
</Note>

Smart Formatting is enabled by default, producing utterances with punctuation and capitalization already applied. Any spoken forms of utterances are also automatically converted to written forms (e.g. 'twenty two' shown as '22').

</Frame>

### Redaction

AutoTranscribe can immediately redact audio for sensitive information, returning utterances with sensitive information denoted in hashmarks.

ASAPP applies default redaction policies to prevent exposure of sensitive combinations of numerical digits. To configure redaction rules for your implementation, consult your ASAPP account contact.

Visit the [Data Redaction](/security/data-redaction) section to learn more.

</Frame>

<note>
  Redaction is enabled by default. Smart Formatting must also be enabled (it is by default) in order for redaction to function.
</note>

## Customization

### Transcriptions

ASAPP customizes transcription models for each implementation of AutoTranscribe to ensure domain-specific context and terminology is well incorporated prior to launch.

Consult your ASAPP account contact if the required historical call audio files are not available ahead of implementing AutoTranscribe.

<table class="informaltable frame-void rules-rows">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="td"><p><strong>Option</strong></p></td>
      <td class="td"><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td>

    <tr>
      <td class="td"><p>Customized</p></td>
      <td class="td"><p>A custom-trained transcription model to incorporate domain-specific terminology likely to be encountered during implementation</p></td>

      <td class="td">
        <p>For English custom models, a minimum 100 hours of representative historical call audio between customers and agents</p>
        <p>For Spanish custom models, a minimum of 200 hours.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
  When supplying recorded audio to ASAPP for AutoTranscribe model training prior to implementation, send uncompressed `.WAV` media files with speaker-separated channels.

  Recordings for training and real-time streams should have both the same sample rate (8000 samples/sec) and audio encoding (16-bit PCM).
</Note>

Visit [Transmitting Data to SFTP](/reporting/send-sftp) for instructions on how to send historical call audio files to ASAPP.

### Vocabulary

In addition to training on historical transcripts, AutoTranscribe accepts explicitly defined custom vocabulary for terms that are specific to your implementation.

AutoTranscribe also boosts detection for these terms by accepting what the term may ordinarily sound like, so that it can be recognized and outputted with the correct spelling.

Common examples of custom vocabulary include:

* Branded products, services and offers
* Commonly used acronyms or abbreviations
* Important corporate addresses

Custom vocabulary is sent to ASAPP for each audio transcription session, and can be consistent for all transcription requests or adjusted for different use cases (different brands, skills/queues, geographies, etc.)

<Note>
  Session-specific custom vocabulary is only available for AutoTranscribe implementations via WebSocket API.

  For Media Gateway implementations, transcription models can also be trained with custom vocabulary through an alternative mechanism. Reach out to your ASAPP account team for more information.
</Note>

## Use Cases

### For Live Agent Assistance

**Challenge**

Organizations are exploring technologies to assist agents in real-time by surfacing customer-specific offers, troubleshooting process flows, topical knowledge articles, relevant customer profile attributes and more. Agents have access to most (if not all) of this content already, but a great assistive technology makes content actionable by finding the right time to bring the right item to the forefront. To do this well, these technologies need to know both what's been said and what is being said in the moment with very low latency.

Many of these technologies face agent adoption and click-through challenges for two reported reasons:

1. Recommended content often doesn't fit the conversation, which may mean the underlying transcription isn't an accurate representation of the real conversation
2. Recommended content doesn't arrive soon enough for them to use it, which may mean the latency between the audio and outputted transcript is too high

**Using AutoTranscribe**

AutoTranscribe is built to be the call transcript input data source for models that power assistive technologies for customer interactions.

Because AutoTranscribe is specifically designed for customer service interactions and trained on implementation-specific historical data, the word error rate (WER) for domain and company-specific language is reduced substantially rather than being the subject of incorrect transcriptions that lead models astray.

To illustrate this point, consider a sample of 10,000 hours of transcribed audio from a typical contact center. A speech-to-text service only needs to recognize 241 of the most frequently used words to get 80% accuracy; those are largely words like "the", "you", "to", "what", and so on.

To get to 90% accuracy, the system needs to correctly transcribe the next 324 most frequently used words, and even more for every additional percent. These are often words that are unique to your business---the words that really matter.

<Tip>
  Read more here about [why small increases in transcription accuracy matter.](https://www.asapp.com/blog/why-a-little-increase-in-transcription-accuracy-is-such-a-big-deal/)
</Tip>

To ensure these high-accuracy transcript inputs reach models quickly enough to make timely recommendations, the expected time from audio received to transcription of that same utterance is 200-600 ms (excluding effects of network delay, as noted in *Transcription Outputs*).

### For Insights and Compliance

**Challenge**

For many organizations, lack of accuracy and coverage of speech-to-text technologies prevent them from effectively employing transcripts for insights, quality management and compliance use cases. Transcripts that fall short of accurately representing conversations compromise the usability of insights and leave too much room for ambiguity for quality managers and compliance teams.

Transcription technologies that aren't accurate enough for many use cases also tend to be employed only for a minority share of total call volume because the outputs aren't useful enough to pay for full coverage. As a result, quality and compliance teams must rely on audio recordings since most calls don't get transcribed.

**Using AutoTranscribe**

AutoTranscribe is specifically designed to maximize domain-specific accuracy for call center conversations. It is trained on past conversations before being deployed and continues to improve early in the implementation as it encounters conversations at scale.

For non real-time use cases, AutoTranscribe also supports processing batches of call audio at an interval that suits the use case.

Teams can query AutoTranscribe outputs in time-stamped utterance tables for data science and targeted compliance use cases or load customer and agent utterances into quality management systems for managers to review in messaging-style user interfaces.

### AI Services That Enhance AutoTranscribe

</Frame>

Once accurate call transcripts are generated, automatic summarization of those customer interactions becomes possible.

ASAPP AutoSummary is a recommended pairing with AutoTranscribe, generating analytics-ready structured summaries and readable paragraph summaries that save agents the distraction of needing to write and submit disposition notes on every call.

# Deploy AutoTranscribe into SIPREC via Media Gateway
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autotranscribe/siprec

Integrate AutoTranscribe into your SIPREC system using ASAPP Media Gateway

This guide covers the **SIPREC Media Gateway** solution pattern, which consists of the following components to receive speech audio and call signals, and return call transcripts:

* Session border controllers and media gateways for receiving call audio from your session border controllers (SBCs)
* HTTPS API to receive requests to start and stop call transcription
* Webhook to POST real-time transcripts to a designated URL of your choosing, alongside two additional APIs to retrieve transcripts after-call for one or a batch of conversations

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-1dced95e-7af4-160d-04a5-fa44d60214ee.png" />
</Frame>

ASAPP works with you to understand your current telephony infrastructure and ecosystem, including the type of voice work assignment platform(s) and other capabilities available, such as SIPREC.

Your ASAPP account team will also determine the main use case(s) for the transcript data to determine where and how call transcripts should be sent.

ASAPP then completes the architecture definition, including integration points into the existing infrastructure.

### Integration Steps

There are three steps to integrate AutoTranscribe into SIPREC:

1. Send Audio to Media Gateway
2. Send Start and Stop Requests
3. Receiving Transcript Outputs

### Requirements

**Audio Stream Codec**

With SIPREC, the customer SBC and the ASAPP media gateway negotiate the media attributes via the SDP offer/answer exchange during the establishment of the session. The codecs in use today are as follows:

* G.711
* G.729

<Note>
  When supplying recorded audio to ASAPP for AutoTranscribe model training prior to implementation, send uncompressed `.WAV` media files with speaker-separated channels.
  Recordings for training and real-time streams should have both the same sample rate (8000 samples/sec) and audio encoding (16-bit PCM).
  See the [Customization section of the AutoTranscribe Product Guide](/autotranscribe/product-guide#customization) for more on data requirements for transcription model training.
</Note>

**Developer Portal**

ASAPP provides an AI Services [Developer Portal](/getting-started/developers). Within the portal, developers can do the following:

* Access relevant API documentation (e.g. OpenAPI reference schemas)
* Access API keys for authorization
* Manage user accounts and apps

<Tip>
  Visit the [Get Started](/getting-started/developers) for instructions on creating a developer account, managing teams and apps, and setup for using AI Service APIs.
</Tip>

## Integrate to the Media Gateway

### 1. Send Audio to Media Gateway

Media Gateway (MG) and Media Gateway Proxy (MG Proxy) components are responsible for receiving real-time audio via SIPREC protocol (acting as Session Recording Servers) along with metadata and sending to AutoTranscribe.

ASAPP offers a software-as-a-service approach to hosting MGs and MG Proxies at ASAPP's VPC in the PCI-scoped zone.

**Network Connectivity**

ASAPP will determine the network connectivity between your infrastructure and the ASAPP AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) based on the architecture; however, there will be secure connections deployed between your data centers and the ASAPP VPC.

* **Edge layer**: ASAPP has built an edge layer utilizing public IPv4 addresses registered to ASAPP. These IP addresses are NOT routed over the Internet, but they guarantee uniqueness across all IP networks. The edge layer houses firewalls and session border controllers that properly take care of full NAT for both SIP and non-SIP traffic.
* **Customer connection aggregation**: Connectivity to customers is done via AWS Transit Gateway, which allows establishment of multiple route-based VPN connections to customers. Sample configuration for various customer devices is available on request.

**Port Details**

Ports and protocols in use for the AutoTranscribe implementations are shown below. These definitions provide visibility to your security teams for the provisioning of firewalls and ACLs.

* **SIP/SIPREC:** TCP 5070 and above; your ASAPP account team will specify a value for your implementation
* **Audio Streams:** UDP \<RTP/RTCP port range>; your ASAPP account team will specify a value for your implementation
* **API Endpoints:** TCP 443

In customer firewalls, you must disable the SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) and any 'Threat Detection' features, as they typically interfere with the SIP dialogs and the re-INVITE process.

#### Generating Call Identifiers

AutoTranscribe uses your call identifier to ensure a given call can be referenced in subsequent start and stop requests and associated with transcripts.

To ensure ASAPP receives your call identifiers properly, configure the SBC to create a universal call identifier (UCID or equivalent identifier).

<Note>
  UCID generation is a native feature for session border controller platforms.

  For example, the Oracle/Acme Packet session border controller platform provides documentation on UCID generation as part of its [configuration guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/communications/enterprise-session-border-controller/8.4.0/configuration/universal-call-identifier-spl). 

  Other session border controller vendors have similar features, so please refer to the vendor documentation for guidance.
</Note>

### 2. Send Start and Stop Requests

As outlined above in requirements, user accounts must be created in the developer portal in order to enroll apps and receive API keys to interact with ASAPP endpoints.

The `/start-streaming` and `/stop-streaming` endpoints of the Start/Stop API are used to control when transcription occurs for every call media stream (identified by the GUID/UCID) sent to ASAPP's media gateway.

See the [Endpoints](#endpoints) section to learn how to interact with them.

ASAPP will not begin transcribing call audio until requested to, thus preventing transcription of audio at the very beginning of the SIPREC session such as standard IVR menus and hold music.

Stop requests are used to pause or end transcription for any needed reason. For example, a stop request could be used mid-call when the agent places the call on hold or at the end of the call to prevent transcribing post-call interactions such as satisfaction surveys.

<Note>
  AutoTranscribe is only meant to transcribe conversations between customers and agents - start and stop requests should be implemented to ensure non-conversation audio (e.g. hold music, IVR menus, surveys) is not being transcribed. Attempted transcription of non-conversation audio will negatively impact other services meant to consume conversation transcripts, such as ASAPP AutoSummary.
</Note>

### 3. Receiving Transcript Outputs

AutoTranscribe outputs transcripts using three separate mechanisms, each corresponding to a different temporal use case:

* **[Real-time](#real-time-via-webhook)**: Webhook posts complete utterances to your target endpoint as they are transcribed during the live conversation
* **[After-call](#after-call-via-get-request)**: GET endpoint responds to your requests for a designated call with the full set of utterances from that completed conversation
* **[Batch](#batch-via-file-exporter)**: File Exporter service responds to your request for a designated time interval with a link to a data feed file that includes all utterances from that interval's conversations

#### Real-Time via Webhook

ASAPP sends transcript outputs in real-time via HTTPS POST requests to a target URL of your choosing.

Authentication

Once the target is selected, work with your ASAPP account team to implement one of the following supported authentication mechanisms:

* **Custom CAs:** Custom CA certificates for regular TLS (1.2 or above).
* **mTLS:** Mutual TLS using custom certificates provided by the customer.
* **Secrets:** A secret token. The secret name is configurable as is whether it appears in the HTTP header or as a URL parameter.
* **OAuth2 (client\_credentials):** Client credentials to fetch tokens from an authentication server.

**Expected Load**

Target servers should be able to support receiving transcript POST messages for each utterance of every live conversation on which AutoTranscribe is active.

For reference, an average live call sends approximately 10 messages per minute. At that rate, 50 concurrent live calls represents approximately 8 messages per second.

Please ensure the selected target server is load tested to support anticipated peaks in concurrent call volume.

**Transcript Timing and Format**

See the [API Reference](/apis/overview)  to learn how to interact with this API.

The expected latency between when ASAPP receives audio for a completed utterance and provides a transcription of that same utterance is 200-600ms.

<Note>
  Perceived latency will also be influenced by any network delay sending audio to ASAPP and receiving transcription messages in return.
</Note>

Though messages are sent in the order they are transcribed, network latency may impact the order in which they arrive or cause messages to be dropped due to timeouts. Where latency causes timeouts, the oldest pending messages will be dropped first; AutoTranscribe does not retry to deliver dropped messages.

The message body for `transcript` type messages is JSON encoded with these fields:

| Field                  | Sub field  | Description                                                                                                                            | Example Value                                |                 |

Expected `transcript` message format:

```json
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "externalConversationId": "<guid>",
  "streamId": "<streamId>",
  "sender": {
    "externalId": "<id>",
    "role": "customer",  // or "agent"
  },
  "autotranscribeResponse": {
    "message": "transcript",
    "start": 0,
    "end": 1000,
    "utterance": [
       {"text": "<transcript text>"}
      ]
  }
}
```

**Error Handling**

Should your target server return an error in response to a POST request, ASAPP will record the error details for the failed message delivery and drop the message.

#### After-Call via GET Request

AutoTranscribe makes a full transcript available at the following endpoint for a given completed call:

`GET /conversation/v1/conversation/messages`
Once a conversation is complete, make a request to the endpoint using a conversation identifier and receive back every message in the conversation.

**Message Limit**

This endpoint will respond with up to 1,000 transcribed messages per conversation, approximately a two-hour continuous call. All messages are received in a single response without any pagination.

To retrieve all messages for calls that exceed this limit, use either a real-time mechanism or File Exporter for transcript retrieval.

<Note>
  Transcription settings (e.g. language, detailed tokens, redaction), for a given call are set with the Start/Stop API, when call transcription is initiated.

  All transcripts retrieved after the call will reflect the initially requested settings with the Start/Stop API.
</Note>

See the [Endpoints](#endpoints) section to learn how to interact with this API.

#### Batch via File Exporter

AutoTranscribe makes full transcripts for batches of calls available using the File Exporter service's `utterances` data feed.

The File Exporter service is meant to be used as a batch mechanism for exporting data to your data warehouse, either on a scheduled basis (e.g. nightly, weekly) or for ad hoc analyses. Data that populates feeds for the File Exporter service updates once daily at 2:00AM UTC.

Visit [Retrieving Data for AI Services](/reporting/file-exporter) for a guide on how to interact with the File Exporter service.

## Usage

### Endpoints

ASAPP receives start/stop requests to signal when transcription for a given call should occur. Start and stop requests can be sent multiple times during a single call (for example, stopped when an agent places the call on hold and resumed when the call is resumed).

<Note>
  For all requests, you must provide a header containing the `asapp-api-id` API Key and the `asapp-api-secret`. You can find them under your Apps in the [AI Services Developer Portal](https://developer.asapp.com/).

  All requests to ASAPP sandbox and production APIs must use `HTTPS` protocol. Traffic using `HTTP` will not be redirected to `HTTPS`.
</Note>

[`POST /mg-autotranscribe/v1/start-streaming/`](/apis/autotranscribe-media-gateway/start-streaming)

Use this endpoint to tell ASAPP to start or resume transcription for a given call.

**When to Call**

Transcription can be started (or resumed after a [`/stop-streaming`](/apis/autotranscribe-media-gateway/stop-streaming) request) at any point during a call.

**Request Details**

Requests must include a call identifier with the GUID/UCID of the SIPREC call, a namespace (e.g. `siprec`), and an identifier from your system(s) for each of the customer and agent participants on the call.

Agent identifiers provided here can tell ASAPP whether agents have changed, indicating a new leg of the call has begun. This agent information enables other services to target specific legs of calls rather than only the higher-level call.

<Note>
  The `guid` field expects the decimal formatting of the identifier.

  Cisco example: `0867617078-0032318833-2221801472-0002236962`

  Avaya example: `00002542391662063156`
</Note>

Requests also include a parameter to indicate the mapping of media lines (m-lines) in the SDP of SIPREC protocol; the parameter specifies whether the top m-line is mapped to the agent or customer participant. The top m-line is typically reversed for outbound calls vs. inbound calls.

Requests may also include optional parameters for transcription including:

* Language (e.g. `en-us` for English or `es-us` for Spanish)
* Whether detailed tokens are requested
* Whether call audio recording is permitted
* Whether transcribed outputs should be redacted, unredacted, or both redacted and unredacted outputs should be returned

<Note>
  AutoTranscribe can immediately redact audio for sensitive information, returning utterances with sensitive information denoted in hashmarks. Visit [Redaction Policies](/security/data-redaction/redaction-policies) to learn more.
</Note>

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with a boolean indicating whether the stream has started successfully along with a `customer` and `agent` object. Each object contains a stream identifier (`streamId`), status code and status description.

[`POST /mg-autotranscribe/v1/stop-streaming/`](/apis/autotranscribe-media-gateway/stop-streaming)

Use this endpoint to tell ASAPP to pause or end transcription for a given call.

**When to Call**

Transcription can be stopped at any point during a call.

**Request Details**

Requests must include a call identifier with the GUID/UCID of the SIPREC call and a namespace (e.g. `siprec`).

<Note>
  The `guid` field expects the decimal formatting of the identifier.

  Cisco example: `0867617078-0032318833-2221801472-0002236962`

  Avaya example: `00002542391662063156`
</Note>

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with a boolean indicating whether the stream has stopped successfully along with a `customer` and `agent` object. Each object contains a stream identifier (`streamId`), status code and status description. Each object also contains a `summary` object of transcription stats related to that participant's stream.

[`GET /conversation/v1/conversation/messages`](/apis/messages/list-messages-with-an-externalid)

Use this endpoint to retrieve all the transcript messages for a completed call.

**When to Call**

Once the conversation is complete. Conversation transcripts are available for seven days after they are completed.

<Note>
  For conversations that include transfers, the endpoint will provide transcript messages for all call legs that correspond to the call's identifier.
</Note>

**Request Details**

Requests must include a call identifier with the GUID/UCID of the SIPREC call.

**Response Details**

When successful, this endpoint responds with an array of objects, each of which corresponds to a single message. Each object contains the text of the message, the sender's role and identifier, a unique message identifier, and timestamps.

#### Error Handling

ASAPP uses HTTP status codes to communicate the success or failure of an API Call.

* 2XX HTTP status codes are for successful API calls.
* 4XX and 5XX HTTP status codes are for errored API calls.

ASAPP errors are returned in the following structure:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "requestId": "67441da5-dd2b-4820-b47d-441998f066e9",
        "message": "Bad request",
        "code": "400-02"
    }
}
```

In the course of using the `/start-streaming` and `/stop-streaming` endpoints, the following error codes may be returned:

| Code      | Description                                           |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `400-201` | MG AutoTranscribe API parameter incorrect             |
| `400-202` | AutoTranscribe parameter or combination incorrect     |
| `400-203` | No call with specified guid found                     |
| `409-201` | Call transcription already started or already stopped |
| `409-202` | Another API request for same guid is pending          |
| `409-203` | SIPREC BYE being processed                            |
| `500-201` | MG AutoTranscribe or AutoTranscribe internal error    |

#### Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission from first user authentication, to secure communications, to our auditing and logging system, all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in the data logging system. Access to data by ASAPP teams is tightly constrained and monitored. Strict security protocols protect both ASAPP and our customers.

## Use Case Example

### Real-Time Transcription

This real-time transcription use case example consists of an English language call between an agent and customer with redaction enabled, ending with a hold. Note that redaction is enabled by default and does not need to be requested explicitly.

1. When the call record is created, ASAPP media gateway components receive real-time audio via SIPREC protocol along with metadata, most notably the call's Avaya-formatted UCID/GUID: `00002542391662063156`
2. When the customer and agent are connected, ASAPP is sent a request to start transcription for the call:

**POST** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/start-streaming`

**Request**

```json
    {
     "namespace": "siprec",
     "guid": "00002542391662063156",
     "customerId": "TT9833237",
     "agentId": "RE223444211993",
     "autotranscribeParams": {
       "language": "en-US"
     },
     "siprecParams": {
       "mediaLineOrder": "CUSTOMER_FIRST"
     }
    } 
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Router processed the request, details are in the response body*

```json
    {
     "isOk": true,
     "autotranscribeResponse": {
       "customer": {
         "streamId": "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         }
       },
       "agent": {
         "streamId": "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         }
       }
     }
    }
```

3. The agent and customer begin their conversation and separate HTTPS POST `transcript` messages are sent for each participant from ASAPP's webhook publisher to a target endpoint configured to receive the messages.

**HTTPS POST for Customer Utterance**

```json
    {
      type: "transcript",
      externalConversationId: "00002542391662063156",
      streamId: "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
      sender: {
        externalId: "TT9833237",
        role: "customer",
      },
      autotranscribeResponse: {
        message: 'transcript',
        start: 400,
        end: 3968,
        utterance: [
           {text: "I need help upgrading my streaming package and my PIN number is ####"}
          ]
      }
    }
```

**HTTPS POST for Agent Utterance**

```json
    {
      type: "transcript",
      externalConversationId: "00002542391662063156",
      streamId: "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
      sender: {
        externalId: "RE223444211993",
        role: "agent",
      },
      autotranscribeResponse: {
        message: 'transcript',
        start: 4744,
        end: 8031,
        utterance: [
           {text: "Thank you sir, let me pull up your account."}
          ]
      }
    }
```

4. Later in the conversation, the agent puts the customer on hold. This triggers a request to the `/stop-streaming` endpoint to pause transcription and prevents hold music and promotional messages from being transcribed.

**POST** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/stop-streaming`

**Request**

```json
    {
     "namespace": "siprec",
     "guid": "00002542391662063156",
    }
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Router processed the request, details are in the response body*

```json
    {
     "isOk": true,
     "autotranscribeResponse": {
       "customer": {
         "streamId": "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         },
         "summary": {
           "totalAudioBytes": 1334720,
           "audioDurationMs": 83420,
           "streamingSeconds": 84,
           "transcripts": 2
         },
       "agent": {
         "streamId": "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         },
         "summary": {
           "totalAudioBytes": 1334720,
           "audioDurationMs": 83420,
           "streamingSeconds": 84,
           "transcripts": 2
         },
       }
     }
    }
```


# Deploying AutoTranscribe for Twilio
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/autotranscribe/twilio

Use AutoTranscribe with Twilio

This guide covers the **Twilio Media Gateway** solution pattern, which consists of the following components to receive speech audio from Twilio, receive call signals, and return call transcripts:

* Media gateways for receiving call audio from Twilio
* HTTPS API which enables the customer to GET a streaming URL to which call audio is sent and POST requests to start and stop call transcription
* Webhook to POST real-time transcripts to a designated URL of your choosing, alongside two additional APIs to retrieve transcripts after-call for one or a batch of conversations

ASAPP works with you to understand your current telephony infrastructure and ecosystem.

Your ASAPP account team will also determine the main use case(s) for the transcript data to determine where and how call transcripts should be sent.

ASAPP then completes the architecture definition, including integration points into the existing infrastructure.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-7d518252-d6a2-da98-a595-edc3b3640295.png" />
</Frame>

### Integration Steps

There are four steps to integrate AutoTranscribe into Twilio:

1. Authenticate with ASAPP and Obtain a Twilio Media Stream URL
2. Send Audio to Media Gateway
3. Send Start and Stop Requests
4. Receive Transcript Outputs

### Requirements

**Audio Stream Codec**

Twilio provides audio in the mu-law format with 8000 sample rate, which is supported by ASAPP. No modification or additional transcoding is needed when forking audio to ASAPP.

<Note>
  When supplying recorded audio to ASAPP for AutoTranscribe model training prior to implementation, send uncompressed .WAV media files with speaker-separated channels.
</Note>

Recordings for training should have a sample rate of 8000 and 16-bit PCM audio encoding.

See the [Customization section of the AutoTranscribe Product Guide](/autotranscribe/product-guide#customization) for more on data requirements for transcription model training.

**Developer Portal**

ASAPP provides an AI Services [Developer Portal](/getting-started/developers). Within the portal, developers can do the following:

* Access relevant API documentation (e.g. OpenAPI reference schemas)
* Access API keys for authorization
* Manage user accounts and apps

<Tip>
  Visit the [Get Started](/getting-started/developers) for instructions on creating a developer account, managing teams and apps, and setup for using AI Service APIs.
</Tip>

## Integrate with Twilio

### 1. Authenticate with ASAPP and Obtain a Twilio Media Stream URL

A Twilio media stream URL is required to start streaming audio. Begin by authenticating with ASAPP to obtain this URL.

<Note>
  All requests to ASAPP sandbox and production APIs must use `HTTPS` protocol. Traffic using `HTTP` will not be redirected to `HTTPS`.
</Note>

The following HTTPS REST API enables authentication with the ASAPP API Gateway:

[`GET /mg-autotranscribe/v1/twilio-media-stream-url`](/apis/autotranscribe-media-gateway/get-twilio-media-stream-url)

HTTP headers (required):

```json
{
    "asapp-api-id": <asapp provided api id>,
    "asapp-api-secret": <asapp provided api secret>
}
```

Header parameters are required and are provided to you by ASAPP in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.asapp.com/).
HTTP response body:

```json
{
   "streamingUrl": "<short-lived URL for twilio media stream>"
}
```

If the authentication succeeds, a secure WebSocket short-lived access URL will be returned in the HTTP response body. TTL (time-to-live) for this URL is 5 minutes.  Validity of the short-lived URL is checked only at the beginning of the WebSocket connection, so duration of the sessions can be as long as needed.  The same short-lived access URL can be used to start as many unique sessions as desired in the 5 minute TTL.

For example, if the call center has an average rate of 1 new call per second, the same short-lived access URL can be used to initiate 300 total calls (60 calls per minute \* 5 minutes).  And each call can last as long as needed, regardless if it's 2 minutes long or longer than 30 minutes.  But after the five minute TTL, a new short-lived access URL will need to be obtained to start any new calls.  It is recommended to obtain a new short-lived URL in less than 5 minutes to always have a valid URL.

### 2. Send Audio to Media Gateway

With the URL obtained in the previous step, instruct Twilio to start sending Media Stream to ASAPP Media Gateway components.  Media Gateway (MG) components are responsible for receiving real-time audio along with Call SID metadata.

<Note>
  Twilio provides multiple ways to initiate Media Stream, which are described in [their documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/media-streams#startstop-media-streams).
</Note>

While instructing Twilio to send Media Streams, it's highly recommended to provide a `statusCallback` URL. Twilio will use this URL in the event connectivity is lost or has an error.  It will be up to the customer call center to process this callback and instruct Twilio to again start new Media Streams, assuming transcriptions are still desired. 

<Tip>
  See Handling Failures for Twilio Media Streams for details below.
</Tip>

ASAPP offers a software-as-a-service approach to hosting MGs at ASAPP's VPC in the PCI-scoped zone.

**Network Connectivity**

Audio will be sent from Twilio cloud to ASAPP cloud via secure (TLS 1.2) WebSocket connections over the internet.  No additional or custom networking is required.

**Port Details**

Ports and protocols in use for the AutoTranscribe implementations are shown below:

* **Audio Streams**: Secure WebSocket with destination port 443
* **API Endpoints**: TCP 443

**Handling Failures for Twilio Media Streams**

There are multiple reasons (e.g. intermediate internet failures, scheduled maintenance) why Twilio Media Stream could be interrupted mid-call. The only way to know that the Media Stream was interrupted is to utilize the `statusCallback` parameter (along with `statusCallbackMethod` if needed) of the Twilio API. Should a failure occur, the URL specified in `statusCallback` parameter will receive the HTTP request informing of a failure.

If a failure notification is received, it means ASAPP has stopped receiving audio from Twilio and no more transcriptions for that call will take place. To restart transcriptions:

* Obtain a Twilio Media Stream URL - unless failure occurred within 5 minutes of the start of the call, you won't be able to reuse the original call streaming URL.
* Send Audio to Media Gateway - instruct Twilio through their API to start a new media stream to the Twilio Media Stream URL provided by ASAPP.
* Send Start request (see [3. Sending Start and Stop Requests](#3-send-start-and-stop-requests) for details).

**Generating Call Identifiers**

AutoTranscribe uses your call identifier to ensure a given call can be referenced in subsequent [start and stop requests](#3-send-start-and-stop-requests) and associated with transcripts.

Twilio will automatically generate a unique Call SID identifier for the call.

### 3. Send Start and Stop Requests

As outlined in [requirements](#requirements), user accounts must be created in the developer portal in order to enroll apps and receive API keys to interact with ASAPP endpoints.

The `/start-streaming` and `/stop-streaming` endpoints of the Start/Stop API are used to control when transcription occurs for every call.

See the [API Reference](/apis/overview)  to learn how to interact with this API.

ASAPP will not begin transcribing call audio until requested to, thus preventing transcription of audio at the very beginning of the audio streaming session, which may include IVR, hold music, or queueing.

Stop requests are used to pause or end transcription for any needed reason. For example, a stop request could be used mid-call when the agent places the call on hold or at the end of the call to prevent transcribing post-call interactions such as satisfaction surveys.

<note>
  AutoTranscribe is only meant to transcribe conversations between customers and agents - start and stop requests should be implemented to ensure non-conversation audio (e.g. hold music, IVR menus, surveys) is not being transcribed. Attempted transcription of non-conversation audio will negatively impact other services meant to consume conversation transcripts, such as ASAPP AutoSummary.
</note>

### 4. Receive Transcript Outputs

AutoTranscribe outputs transcripts using three separate mechanisms, each corresponding to a different temporal use case:

* **[Real-time](#real-time-via-webhook)**: Webhook posts complete utterances to your target endpoint as they are transcribed during the live conversation
* **[After-call](#after-call-via-get-request)**: GET endpoint responds to your requests for a designated call with the full set of utterances from that completed conversation
* **[Batch](#batch-via-file-exporter)**: File Exporter service responds to your request for a designated time interval with a link to a data feed file that includes all utterances from that interval's conversations

#### Real-Time via Webhook

ASAPP sends transcript outputs in real-time via HTTPS POST requests to a target URL of your choosing.

Authentication

Once the target is selected, work with your ASAPP account team to implement one of the following supported authentication mechanisms:

* **Custom CAs:** Custom CA certificates for regular TLS (1.2 or above).
* **mTLS:** Mutual TLS using custom certificates provided by the customer.
* **Secrets:** A secret token. The secret name is configurable as is whether it appears in the HTTP header or as a URL parameter.
* **OAuth2 (client\_credentials):** Client credentials to fetch tokens from an authentication server.

Expected Load

Target servers should be able to support receiving transcript POST messages for each utterance of every live conversation on which AutoTranscribe is active.

For reference, an average live call sends approximately 10 messages per minute. At that rate, 50 concurrent live calls represents approximately 8 messages per second.

Please ensure the selected target server is load tested to support anticipated peaks in concurrent call volume.

Transcript Timing and Format

Once you have started transcription for a given call stream using the `/start-streaming` endpoint, AutoTranscribe begins to publish `transcript` messages, each of which contains a full utterance for a single call participant.

The expected latency between when ASAPP receives audio for a completed utterance and provides a transcription of that same utterance is 200-600ms.

<Note>
  Perceived latency will also be influenced by any network delay sending audio to ASAPP and receiving transcription messages in return.
</Note>

Though messages are sent in the order they are transcribed, network latency may impact the order in which they arrive or cause messages to be dropped due to timeouts. Where latency causes timeouts, the oldest pending messages will be dropped first; AutoTranscribe does not retry to deliver dropped messages.

The message body for `transcript` type messages is JSON encoded with these fields:

| Field                  | Subfield   | Description                                                                                                                            | Example Value                        |
| :--------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |

Expected `transcript` message format:

```json
{
  "type": "transcript",
  "externalConversationId": "<twilio call SID>",
  "streamId": "<streamId>",
  "sender": {
    "externalId": "<id>",
    "role": "customer",  // or "agent"
  },
  "autotranscribeResponse": {
    "message": "transcript",
    "start": 0,
    "end": 1000,
    "utterance": [
       {"text": "<transcript text>"}
      ]
  }
}
```

Error Handling

Should your target server return an error in response to a POST request, ASAPP will record the error details for the failed message delivery and drop the message.

#### After-Call via GET Request

AutoTranscribe makes a full transcript available at the following endpoint for a given completed call:

`GET /conversation/v1/conversation/messages`

Once a conversation is complete, make a request to the endpoint using a conversation identifier and receive back every message in the conversation.

Message Limit

This endpoint will respond with up to 1,000 transcribed messages per conversation, approximately a two-hour continuous call. All messages are received in a single response without any pagination.

To retrieve all messages for calls that exceed this limit, use either a real-time mechanism or File Exporter for transcript retrieval.

<Note>
  Transcription settings (e.g. language, detailed tokens, redaction), for a given call are set with the Start/Stop API, when call transcription is initiated. All transcripts retrieved after the call will reflect the initially requested settings with the Start/Stop API.
</Note>

See the [API Reference](/apis/overview)  to learn how to interact with this API.

#### Batch via File Exporter

AutoTranscribe makes full transcripts for batches of calls available using the File Exporter service's `utterances` data feed.

The File Exporter service is meant to be used as a batch mechanism for exporting data to your data warehouse, either on a scheduled basis (e.g. nightly, weekly) or for ad hoc analyses. Data that populates feeds for the File Exporter service updates once daily at 2:00AM UTC.

Visit [Retrieving Data from ASAPP](https://asapp.mintlify.app/reporting/data-from-messaging-platform) for a guide on how to interact with the File Exporter service.

## Use Case Example

Real-Time Transcription

This real-time transcription use case example consists of an English language call between an agent and customer with redaction enabled, ending with a hold. Note that redaction is enabled by default and does not need to be requested explicitly.

1. Obtain a Twilio media streaming URL destination by authenticating with ASAPP.

   **GET** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/twilio-media-stream-url`
   **Response**

   *STATUS 200: OK - Twilio media stream url in the response body*

```json
    {
      "streamingUrl": "wss://localhost/twilio-media?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
    }
```

2. With the URL obtained in the previous step, instruct Twilio to start Media Stream to ASAPP media gateway components.  ASAPP will now receive real-time audio via Twilio Stream along with metadata, most notably the call's SID: `CA5b040e075515c424391012acc5a870cf`

3. When the customer and agent are connected, send ASAPP a request to start transcription for the call:

   **POST** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/start-streaming`
   **Request**

```json
    {
     "namespace": "twilio",
     "guid": "CA5b040e075515c424391012acc5a870cf",
     "customerId": "TT9833237",
     "agentId": "RE223444211993",
     "autotranscribeParams": {
       "language": "en-US"
     },
     "twilioParams": {
       "trackMap": {
         "inbound": "customer",
         "outbound": "agent"
       }
     }
    } 
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Router processed the request, details are in the response body*

```json
    {
     "isOk": true,
     "autotranscribeResponse": {
       "customer": {
         "streamId": "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         }
       },
       "agent": {
         "streamId": "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         }
       }
     }
    }
```

4. The agent and customer begin their conversation and separate HTTPS POST `transcript` messages are sent for each participant from ASAPP's webhook publisher to a target endpoint configured to receive the messages.

   HTTPS **POST** for Customer Utterance

```json
    {
      type: "transcript",
      externalConversationId: "CA5b040e075515c424391012acc5a870cf",
      streamId: "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
      sender: {
        externalId: "TT9833237",
        role: "customer",
      },
      autotranscribeResponse: {
        message: 'transcript',
        start: 400,
        end: 3968,
        utterance: [
           {text: "I need help upgrading my streaming package and my PIN number is ####"}
          ]
      }
    }
```

HTTPS **POST** for Agent Utterance

```json
    {
      type: "transcript",
      externalConversationId: "CA5b040e075515c424391012acc5a870cf",
      streamId: "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
      sender: {
        externalId: "RE223444211993",
        role: "agent",
      },
      autotranscribeResponse: {
        message: 'transcript',
        start: 4744,
        end: 8031,
        utterance: [
           {text: "Thank you sir, let me pull up your account."}
          ]
      }
    }
```

5. Later in the conversation, the agent puts the customer on hold. This triggers a request to the `/stop-streaming` endpoint to pause transcription and prevents hold music and promotional messages from being transcribed.

   **POST** `/mg-autotranscribe/v1/stop-streaming`

   **Request**

```json
    {
     "namespace": "twilio",
     "guid": "CA5b040e075515c424391012acc5a870cf",
    }
```

**Response**

*STATUS 200: Router processed the request, details are in the response body*

```json
    {
     "isOk": true,
     "autotranscribeResponse": {
       "customer": {
         "streamId": "5ce2b755-3f38-11ed-b755-7aed4b5c38d5",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         },
         "summary": {
           "totalAudioBytes": 1334720,
           "audioDurationMs": 83420,
           "streamingSeconds": 84,
           "transcripts": 2
         },
       "agent": {
         "streamId": "cf31116-3f38-11ed-9116-7a0a36c763f1",
         "status": {
           "code": 1000,
           "description": "OK"
         },
         "summary": {
           "totalAudioBytes": 1334720,
           "audioDurationMs": 83420,
           "streamingSeconds": 84,
           "transcripts": 2
         },
       }
     }
    }
```

### Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission, from first user authentication to secure communications to our auditing and logging system (which includes hashing of data in transit) all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in the data logging system. The teams at ASAPP are also under tight restraints in terms of access to data. These security protocols protect both ASAPP and its customers.


# AutoCompose Updates

New updates and improvements across AutoCompose

<Update label="2023-10-16 - Sandbox for AutoCompose">
  AutoCompose Sandbox is a playground environment that allows administrators to preview and test the AutoCompose experience before integration. The sandbox provides a realistic simulation of how agents will interact with AutoCompose's suggestion features, including:

  * Complete response suggestions above the composer
  * In-line suggestions while typing
  * Custom response management through the AutoCompose panel
  * Access to the global response library

  The sandbox environment helps administrators understand the agent experience and evaluate AutoCompose's capabilities firsthand.

  <Frame caption="AutoCompose running in a sandbox environment.">
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-780cd7be-c1db-c5f1-cef1-8627c8e2eec3.png" />
  </Frame>

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    Watch the following video walkthrough to learn how to use the AutoCompose Sandbox:

    <iframe width="560" height="315" allow="fullscreen *" src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ezkjx798f7" />

    AutoCompose Sandbox enables you to play both sides of the conversation. AutoCompose won't suggest anything while simulating a customer, but suggestions will populate for the agent role.

    The AutoCompose panel situated on the right side allows you to define and browse custom responses, which can then be accessed as suggestions in the composer. It also enables browsing of the global response list that has been defined globally. Finally, it allows an agent to customize the behavior of AutoPilot.

    As agents use the suggestions provided by AutoCompose, the response library will grow, which will be reflected in the suggestions produced by AutoCompose.
  </Accordion>
</Update>

<Update label="2022-12-07 - Tooling for AutoCompose">
  AutoCompose now supports configuration of the global response list in ASAPP's AI-Console. Users can manage responses through bulk uploads via CSV files or targeted edits in the UI. This self-serve capability enables teams to maintain an up-to-date response library that improves suggestion quality and coverage for agents.

    **Configurable Response Elements**

    Users can configure four data elements for each global response:

    * **Response text**: The text of the response (required)
    * **Folder path**: The hierarchy that dictates where the response resides
    * **Title**: The short-form title of the response
    * **Metadata filters**: A key and value used to specify the set of conversations for which a response is available

    </Frame>

    **Saving and Deploying**

    Saving changes to the global response list or uploading a new list creates a new version. Past versions can also be viewed and restored as needed.

    The global response list can be easily deployed into testing or production environments, with an indicator at the top of each version showing the status of the response list (e.g. Live in production).

    ## FAQs

    1. **How do you access AutoCompose in AI-Console?**

       Provided that you have permission to access AutoCompose in AI-Console, it will appear in the AI Services section of your homepage.
       To access AutoCompose from any other AI-Console page, select the menu icon in the top left corner and then select AutoCompose.

    2. **How does response metadata work?**

       AutoCompose uses response metadata in two main ways:

       * **As a data insert:** Variable metadata such as customer name or time of day is dynamically inserted into templated response text when a suggestion is made to the agent. Read more about templated responses in the AutoCompose Product Guide Features
       * **As a filter:** Responses are only made available for suggestion when the conversation's metadata matches the attribute set for a given response (e.g. a response only being available when `queue` = `general`).

       <Note>
         Agent first name, customer first name and time of day inserts are available by default. Consult your ASAPP account team for assistance with adding metadata for use as an insert or a filter.
       </Note>

    3. **How can I search the list for specific responses?**

       There is a search bar to look up specific words from response text. Dropdown menus can also be used to filter by folder path and metadata filter.

    ## FAQs

    * **Can I modify the custom vocabulary after it's been created?**

      Yes, users can update the custom vocabulary at any time. To do so, first delete the existing vocabulary and then submit a new create request.
      This process ensures that the vocabulary remains current and relevant.

    * **Can I send the create request for multiple custom vocab additions?**

      Currently multiple custom vocab addition capability is not live, users must submit individual create requests for each addition.
      That said, If a large number of additions are required, please contact ASAPP's support team for assistance.

    * **Is there a limit to the number of custom vocabularies that can be added?**

      Yes, The maximum number of custom vocabulary entries is 200. However, this limit is subject to change as ASAPP continuously updates and expands its backend capabilities to support more custom vocab.

    * **Is there a limit to the number of sounds like items within the custom vocab?**

      The maximum number of sounds like items should be 5 and length of each item should be 40 characters

<Update label="2024-08-20 - Custom Redaction Entities">
  AutoTranscribe now includes a self-serve feature that allows users to manage redaction entities through a configuration API. This enables users to independently enable or disable redaction of PCI and PII data in their transcriptions.

  Key benefits:

  * Self-service configuration of which sensitive data types to redact
  * Automated redaction of enabled entities during transcription
  * Faster onboarding with reduced dependency on ASAPP teams

  <Note>
    Some PCI rules are enabled by default for compliance and require ASAPP approval to modify.
  </Note>

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    The API Calls take a single conversation identifier and immediately returns an array of messages that covers the full conversation.

    ## FAQs

    * **What is an entity?**

      In the context of redaction, an entity refers to a specific type or category of information that you want to remove or obscure from the response text. Entities are the "labels" for the pieces of information you want redacted. For example, "NAME" is an entity that represents personal names, "ADDRESS" represents physical addresses, and "ZIP" represents postal codes. When you wish to redact, you specify which entities you want redacted from your text.

    * **Can I delete existing redaction entities?**

      Users can only enable or disable the predefined entities listed in the previous section. Due to PCI compliance regulations, two entities (CREDIT\_CARD\_NUMBER and CVV) are initially disabled and can only be removed through ASAPP's compliance process. All other entities are not enabled by default, but users have the flexibility to enable any of these according to their specific requirements. Users cannot create new entities or modify existing ones; they can only control the activation status of the predefined set.

    * **What is the accuracy of the redaction service of ASAPP?**

      Our redaction service currently supports over 50 Out of the box (OOTB) entities, with the flexibility to expand and update this set as required. For specific entity customization, including enabling or disabling particular entities or suggesting new entities to tailor to your specific needs, please contact ASAPP's support team.

# ASAPP Messaging Updates - Customer Channels
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/changelog/messaging-customer-channels

New updates and improvements for ASAPP Messaging - Customer Channels

<Update label="2024 - Form Messages for Apple Messages for Business">
  ASAPP enables Form Messages, a native Apple Messages for Business (AMB) format that replaces Omniforms (link to a web form) with a rich, multi-page interactive experience. You can gather customer information through customizable forms that present a single field per page and let your customers review their entries before submitting—all without leaving the Apple Messages application.

  This enables you to deliver a more seamless and aesthetically pleasing experience for your customers, consistent with other Apple applications.

  </Frame>

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    Watch the video walkthrough below to learn more about Form Messages:

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/d6la1ez6j4" />

    ### Supported Forms

    When a form is sent to a customer in Apple Messages for Business, supported forms will display as a Form Message, which has a single form field on each page and allows the customer to review their form entries before submitting.

    Examples of supported form field types include:

    * Text
    * Name
    * Location
    * Date
    * Phone Number
    * Numbers
    * Selectors

    ### Unsupported Forms

    Customers will be sent an Omniform rather than an AMB Form Message if one of the following is true:

    * The customer is not on an iOS version that supports Form Messages
    * It is a Secure Form
    * The flow node is configured to have the form disappear when a new message is sent
    * There are more than seven fields in the form; this limit exists because there is a known AMB Form Messages issue that requires a customer to start over if they background the Messages app while filling out a form and then return back to it
    * Any field has a prefilled value
    * Any field has password masking
    * If the form has more than one submit button
    * The form contains a scale, paragraph, or table field

    Contact your ASAPP account team to enable Form Messages and to determine which forms customers will receive as Form Messages.

    <Note>
      Form Messages for multilingual forms are not yet supported. If using a Spanish Virtual Agent, Form Messages are not available.
    </Note>

    ## FAQs

    1. **Why did I have to start filling out my form from the start after leaving and coming back to it?**

    There is a known AMB Form Messages issue that requires a customer to start over if they background the Messages app while filling out a form and then return back to it.

    2. **Can I enable/disable an individual form to be a Form Message?**

    No, it is a company-level configuration. If enabled, all supported forms will be sent as AMB Form Messages.

<Update label="2024 - WhatsApp Business">
  ASAPP supports [WhatsApp Business as a messaging channel](/messaging-platform/integrations/whatsapp-business), enabling your customers to interact with virtual agents and have conversations with live agents in their preferred messaging app.

  This expanded channel support gives you the ability to offer robust messaging experiences to your WhatsApp users, encouraging them to choose messaging more often and have more satisfying interactions in a familiar setting.

  <Frame>
    <img width="300px" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-8bc3cef3-6ec9-36d9-f818-4e40140fe37d.png" />
  </Frame>

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    ASAPP's integration with WhatsApp Business supports similar functionality to what is available in other customer channels. At an overview level, see below for supported and unsupported features:

    **Support included:**

    * Automated flows
    * Deeplinked entry points
    * Free-text disambiguation
    * Estimated wait time
    * Live chat with agents
    * Push notifications
    * Secure forms
    * End-of-chat feedback forms

    **Not currently supported:**

    * Customer authentication
    * Customer history
    * Chat Instead entry point
    * Customer attributes for routing
    * Customer typing preview for agents, typing indicator for customers
    * Images sent by customers
    * Carousels, attachment, images in automated flows
    * New question/welcome back prompts
    * Proactive messaging
    * Co-browsing

    <Note>
      \[Integration documentation is published here]\(./messaging-plat. Reach out to your ASAPP account contact to get started with WhatsApp Business. They can also advise on specific expected behaviors for virtual agent and live chat features in WhatsApp Business as needed.
    </Note>

    ## FAQs

    1. **What are the basic setup steps for WhatsApp Business?**

    Enterprises start by [creating a general Business Manager (BM) account with Meta](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347) and verify their business.

    While this happens, ASAPP deploys backend services in support of the integration. After creating a BM account, completing business verification, and registering phone numbers, you can then create an official WhatsApp Business Account via the embedded signup flow in AI-Console.

    After setup, your ASAPP account team will work with you on modifying automated flows for use in WhatsApp and coordinate lower environment testing once changes are complete. The final step is to create entry point URL links and QR codes in the WhatsApp Business dashboard, and insert entry points as needed in your customer-facing web and social properties.

    2. **How will my current automated flows be displayed in WhatsApp Business?**

    The WhatsApp customer experience is distinct from ASAPP SDKs in several ways - some elements are displayed differently while others are not supported.

    Elements that are displayed differently use message text with links - this includes buttons for quick replies and external links. Similarly, both (a) forms sent by agents and (b) feedback forms at the end of chat also send messages with links to a separate page to complete the survey, after which time users are redirected back to WhatsApp.

    Quick replies in WhatsApp also have different limitations from ASAPP SDKs, supporting a maximum of three quick replies per node and 20 characters per quick reply. Your ASAPP account team will work with you to implement intent routing and flows to account for nodes with unsupported elements, such as authentication and attachments.

    3. **Will agents know they are chatting with a customer using WhatsApp?**

    Yes. Agents will see the WhatsApp icon in the left-hand panel of Agent Desk.

    4. **Where can I learn more about WhatsApp Business?**

<Update label="2024 - Authentication in Apple Messages for Business">
  ## Authentication in Apple Messages for Business Feature Release

  ASAPP now supports customer authentication in Apple Messages for Business. With this new functionality, customers can securely log in to their accounts during interactions, allowing them to access personalized experiences in automated flows and when speaking with agents.

  Customer authentication is intended for any interaction where making use of account information creates a better experience for the customer:

  * **Any live interaction with an agent:** Enable your agents to greet and validate who they're speaking with, review historical customer conversations, and quickly reference relevant account attributes.
  * **Automated flows:** Present data related to a customer's account (e.g., booking details) or take actions on behalf of the customer (e.g., make a payment).

  Identifying a customer in an interaction also adds valuable context when reviewing historical interactions in Insights Manager for reporting or compliance purposes.

  Expanding support for customer authentication in this channel should:

  1. Reduce the share of interactions that are directed to agents due to customers being unable to access automated flows that require authentication.
  2. Reduce the share of interactions that are directed to agents due to customers being unable to access automated flows that require authentication
  3. Expand the share of interactions with agents that benefit from account information and conversation history, reducing effort to identify customers and search for account information

  |                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                    |

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    **User Experience**

    Once implemented, any instance in an ASAPP automated flow that triggers customer authentication today will do so during an interaction in Apple Messages for Business.

    When this occurs, Apple Messages for Business will ask the user to login via a button. Once the user clicks the button, they will be brought out of the iMessages app and redirected to a webpage/browser window to sign in. Users will have to sign-in with their credentials every time their authentication token expires.

    **Architecture**

    User Authentication in Apple Messages for Business utilizes a standards-based approach using an OAuth 2.0 flow with additional key validation and OAuth token encryption steps.

    This approach requires companies to implement and host a login page to which Apple Messages for Business will direct the user for authentication.

    Visit [Apple Messages for Business integration guide](/messaging-platform/integrations/apple-messages-for-business#customer-authentication) for more information.

    <Note>
      Reach out to your ASAPP account team to coordinate on the implementation of customer authentication in Apple Messages for Business.
    </Note>

    ## FAQs

    1. **What are the steps required to implement authentication?**

       This primarily depends on if a suitable login page and token endpoint already exists or requires customer development. Your ASAPP account team can provide exact details on the specifications these must meet.

       Configuration is required by ASAPP and on the Apple Business Register. Chat flows that use APIs may require modification to match the rendering capabilities of Apple Messages for Business but this can be done incrementally.

       Testing of the feature can be done in a lower environment prior to production launch. ASAPP implementation time is 6-12 weeks depending on flow complexity, and total customer integration time is dependent on customer dependencies.
    2. **If our user base has a broad range of device versions and iOS versions, will they all have the same authentication experience? If not, what needs to be done to ensure that they do?**

       Yes. For iOS versions 15 & 16+, the user experience for authentication will be the same. However, users with devices that run iOS versions earlier than 12 will not be able to access authentication.

       From a technical perspective, different token endpoints will need to be supported simultaneously to allow users across iOS versions 15 and 16+ to access authentication. More specifically, distinct endpoints will be needed to support users with iOS versions 15 or 16+, as well as devices running these iOS versions to test.

       <Note>
         For iOS versions 16+, ASAPP will soon support Apple's newest authentication architecture, which we strongly encourage implementing once it becomes available.
       </Note>
    3. **Does authentication happen inline within the chat experience?**

       No. In the current virtual agent experience, a user will see a login button and then be redirected to a webpage to enter their credentials and complete the login action. They will then be automatically redirected to the chat experience within 10 seconds of successfully authenticating.
    4. **How many attempts will a user be given to authenticate? Are there configurable limits to this?**

       This is governed by how many retries the customer login page allows.
    5. **When is conversation history carried across channels, both from the customer and agent's perspectives?**

       * If a customer is authenticated in the Apple Messages for Business channel, they will see their conversation history for previous authenticated Apple sessions but not their history from other channels.
       * If during an authenticated Apple session, the customer moves to another channel (e.g. Web SDK) and authenticates, the Apple conversation from that session will appear in the new channel. Additionally, as the customer engages via the Web SDK, agent responses will continue to appear in Apple Messages for Business until the token for the Apple session has expired.
       * In all other instances, the conversation history from Apple Messages for Business will not be visible to customers when they start subsequent conversations in other channels.
       * From the agent's perspective, conversation history from all channels is visible in Agent Desk so long as customers have signed in using the same credentials.

<Update label="2024 - Quick Replies in Apple Messages for Business">
  ## Quick Replies in Apple Messages for Business Feature Release

  ASAPP's automated flows support quick replies for customers that use the Apple Messages for Business channel. Quick replies display response options directly in the messaging interface, allowing customers to make an inline choice with a single tap during an ongoing conversation.

  As in ASAPP's customer channels for web and mobile apps, quick replies are used to give customers a defined set of response options, each of which leads to a corresponding branch in an automated flow. Key use cases for quick replies in automated flows include the following:

  1. Discovery questions to better specify a customer issue or account detail
  2. Ensuring the customer's issue has been addressed by an automated flow

  Using quick replies in Apple Messages for Business is expected to reduce friction that can cause customer drop-off and frustration before fully completing a flow or reaching an agent to better assist with an issue.

  <Frame>

  </Frame>

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    Quick reply support in Apple Messages for Business is expected to function similarly to quick replies in ASAPP SDKs for web and mobile apps, with the following differences:

    **Number of Quick Replies**\
    Apple Messages for Business supports a minimum of two quick replies and a maximum of five per node.

    **Push Notification and Selection Confirmation**\
    When quick reply options are sent, users receive a push notification if Messages is not open; the title of the message will be 'Choose an option'. Once the user selects a response option, Apple displays a checkmark beside text 'Choose an option' in the Messages UI. This is a default behavior and is not configurable.

    **Length of Quick Replies**\
    All quick replies will render as a single line of text with a maximum of 24 characters; if the text exceeds 24 characters, it will be truncated with ellipses after the first 21 characters.

    **OS Version Support**\
    Quick replies are supported in iOS 15.1 and macOS 12.0 or higher; prior operating systems will use the list picker interface.

    ## FAQs

    1. **Is there any work required to adapt existing automated flows to support quick replies in Apple Messages for Business?**\
       Once your ASAPP account team completes a small configuration change, all flows configured with quick replies today will automatically use them in Apple Messages for Business for supported iOS and macOS versions.

    <Note>
      Flows with nodes that have more than five quick reply options will need to be edited to use five or fewer quick replies - any quick replies in excess of the first five will not be visible in this channel. Flows with quick reply text that exceeds 24 characters will need to be shortened or will be shown with ellipses after the first 21 characters in this channel.
    </Note>

    2. **Can the list picker experience be selected in AI-Console for designated automated flows or are quick replies the only option?**\
       Currently, if quick replies are enabled, they will be the only supported option across automated flows. The list picker experience will be used for older versions of iOS and macOS.

New updates and improvements for ASAPP Messaging - Digital Agent Desk

<Update label="2025 - Chat Takeover">
  ## Chat Takeover

  Managers have the ability to take over a chat from either an agent or an unassigned chat in the queue. Managers will then be able to service the chat from Agent Desk.

  This capability impacts the following ways:

  * Close chats where the issue has been resolved but still hasn't been dispositioned.
  * Take over complex or convoluted chats.
  * Handle part of the queue traffic in high-traffic situations.

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-1888ee10-a86c-3e97-c22e-17468eb31c7f.png" />

  </Frame>

  ## How it Works

  Managers can take over a chat by navigating to a specific conversation in Live Insights and clicking on it to open the transcript area. The user can then click on the Takeover button in the upper left-hand corner. A confirmation prompt will appear to ensure the user wants to take over the chat. Once the chat has been transferred, the user will be notified. There is no limit to the number of chats a user can take over.

  After that, admins can continue the chat and manage it at will. Users need to ensure they have access to Agent Desk to service the chat they have taken over. Access to the takeover functionality is granted through permissions set up by ASAPP.
</Update>

<Update label="2025 - Send Attachments">
  ## Send Attachments

  End customers can send pdf attachments to agents in order to provide more information about their case

  Agents might need to receive PDFs and images in order to complete or service an issue related to a customer chat. Such as a fraud case as they need proof of the transaction.

  | Receiving PDFs                                                                                                                     | Receiving Images                                                                                                                   |

<Update label="2024 - Search Queue Names">
  ## Search Queue Names

  Agent Desk enables agents to easily transfer conversations to different queues by typing in the queue name and selecting it from a filtered list of results.

  The search functionality is particularly useful for agents that have a long list of queue choices in the transfer menu.

  We expect that a search functionality will help ensure agents select the right queue, reducing the number of transfers to unintended or incorrect queues.

  *Search queue name in queue transfer menu.*

  ## How It Works

  Agents can select the queue to which they want to transfer the conversation by entering its name and choosing it from a filtered list.

  <Note>
    The search query will filter only the exact matches of the queue's name.
  </Note>
</Update>

<Update label="2024 - Auto-Pilot Endings">
  ## Auto-Pilot Endings

  Agent Desk can now automate the end-of-chat process for agents, allowing them to opt-in to an Auto-Pilot Ending flow that will take care of the entire check-in and ending process so that agents can focus on more valuable tasks.

  Agents can turn Auto-pilot Endings on and off globally, edit the message, and personalize it with data inserts (such as 'customer name'), cancel the flow, or even speed it up to close the conversation earlier.

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-6ca91a97-4e73-678e-e7e3-72de9f8ce701.png" />
  </Frame>

  *Auto-Pilot Endings running in Agent Desk with Initial Message queued.*

  Customers often become unresponsive once they do not need anything else from the agent. To free up their slots to serve other customers waiting in the queue, agents must confirm there is nothing more they can help the customer with before closing the chat.

  To ensure the customer has a grace period to respond before being disconnected, agents follow a formulaic, multi-step check-in process with the customer prior to ending the chat. In these situations, Auto-Pilot Endings is intended to free up agents' attention for more active conversations, leading to greater agent efficiency.

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    Watch the video walkthrough below to learn more about Auto-Pilot Endings:

    <iframe width="500" height="315" src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/7b811v89x6" />

    Auto-Pilot Endings enables agents to configure the ending message that is delivered in sequence. Each message is meant to be automatically sent to the customer when they become unresponsive:

    ### Messages

    * **Initial Message** - Asking the customer if there is anything else that needs to be discussed.\
      *Example: "Is there anything else I can help you with?"*

    * **Check-in Message** - Confirming whether the customer is still there.\
      *Example: "Are you still with me?"*

    * **Second (Closing) Message** - A graceful ending message to close out the conversation. ASAPP can embed the customer name in this message.\
      *Example: "Thank you {FirstName}! It was a pleasure assisting you today. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions."*

    ### Procedure

    For each conversation, Auto-Pilot Endings follows a simple sequence when enabled:

    1. **Suggestion or Manual Start:** Agent Desk will suggest to the agent to start the ending flow, through a pop-up banner at the top of the middle panel, when it predicts the issue has concluded. Agents can also manually start it from the dropdown menu in the header before a suggestion appears.

    2. **Initial Message Queued:** Once Auto-Pilot Ending is initiated, Agent Desk shows the agent the initial message that is ready to send to the customer. On the right-hand panel, the notes panel will appear showing agents the automatic summary and free-text notes field. An indicator will show on the left-hand panel chat card along with a timer countdown showing when the initial message will be sent.

    3. **Initial Message Sent:** Once the countdown is complete, the initial message is sent and another timer begins waiting for the customer to respond.

    4. **Customer Response:** Agent Desk shows a countdown for how long it will wait for a response before sending a Check-in Message. It detects the following customer response types and acts accordingly:

       | Customer Response Type                         | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

       | A. Customer confirms they don't need more help | Closing Message is queued and sends after its countdown is complete; the chat issue ends. The agent can also choose to end the conversation before the countdown completes. ![Auto-pilot ending showing the closing message and a count down timer.](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-d77354d8-3b33-6b6c-b14f-c57fc4226f80.png)                                         |
       | B. Customer confirms they need more help       | The Auto-Pilot Endings flow is canceled; the conversation continues as normal. A "new message" signal is sent to the agent to inform him that the customer returned the interaction. ![Autopilot ending canceled message showing along with a new message icon showing on the conversation.](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-6f3b53eb-31e6-bb50-89d8-d079b385c39c.png) |
       | C. Unresponsive customer                       | A Check-in Message is sent and another timer begins. If the customer remains unresponsive, the Closing Message is sent and the chat issue ends. If the customer responds with any message, the Auto-Pilot Endings flow is canceled and the conversation continues as normal.                                                                                                                        |

    ### Agent Capabilities

    **Manually Ending Auto-Pilot Endings Flow**\
    At any time, an agent can click **Cancel** in the Composer window to end the Auto-Pilot Ending flow and return the conversation to its normal state.

    **Manually Sending Ending Messages**\
    Any time a message is queued, an agent can click **Send now** in the Composer window to bypass the countdown timer, send the message, and move to the next step in the flow.

    **Managing Auto-Pilot Endings**\
    Under the **Ending** tab in the **Responses** drawer of the right rail of Agent Desk, agents can:

    * Enable or disable AutoPilot Endings using a toggle at the top of the tab.
    * Customize the wording of the Closing Message; there are two versions of the message, accounting for when Agent Desk is aware and unaware of the customer's first name.

    </Frame>

    ### Feature Configuration

    Customers must reach out to their ASAPP contact to configure Auto-Pilot Endings globally for their program:

    **Global Default Auto-Pilot Ending Messages**

    * Initial Message
    * Check-in message
    * Closing Message (named customer)
    * Closing Message (unidentified customer)

    <Note>
      Agents will only be able to personalize the Closing Messages in Agent Desk
    </Note>

    **Global Default Auto-Pilot Ending Timers**

    * Main timer: The time to wait before sending both the initial and closing messages.
    * No-response timer: The time to wait to send the check-in message if there's no response from the customer after a check-in message is sent.

    ## FAQs

    1. **How is this feature different from Auto-Pilot Timeout?**\
       Auto-Pilot Timeout is meant for conversations that have stopped abruptly before concluding and is only recommended in those instances. When an agent enables and completes Auto-Pilot Timeout, the flow concludes with a customer being timed out. A timed out customer can resume their conversation and be placed back at the top of the queue if their issue hasn't yet expired. Auto-Pilot Endings is meant for conversations that are clearly ending. When an agent enables Auto-Pilot Endings, the flow concludes with ending the conversation. If the customer wants to chat again, they will be placed back into the queue and treated as a new issue.

    2. **How does ASAPP classify the customer's response to the Initial Message to determine whether they are ready to end the conversation or still need help?**\
       When a customer responds to the Initial Message (asking whether they need more help), ASAPP classifies the return message into two categories:

    * A positive response confirming they don't need more help and are done with the conversation
    * A negative response confirming they need more help

    ASAPP uses a classification model trained on both types of responses to make the determination in real-time during the Auto-Pilot Endings flow.

<Update label="2024 - Customer History Context">
  ## Customer History Context

  This feature enables Agent Desk users to get context and historical conversation highlights when providing support to an authenticated customer.

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-90784a9f-4b21-1e72-aa49-d5c6e6146ce5.png" />

  **Updated "past conversation" indicator in the "Profile" tab, and updated "Past Conversation" tab.**

  ## Use and Impact

  Past Conversations enables agents to provide customers with a more confident, informed, and tailored experience by displaying information about previous conversations with those customers.

  This feature improves agents' efficiency and effectiveness by enhancing the retrievability and usefulness of historical conversation data.

  As a result, it helps to reduce operational metrics such as Average Handling Time (AHT) and increase effectiveness indicators like the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score.

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    When agents log in to Agent Desk, they will notice a dynamic indicator under the context card's profile tab. This indicator alerts agents of past conversations with the customer and how long ago they occurred, eliminating the need for agents to switch between tabs.

    Agents can either click the view button or toggle to the **Past Conversations** tab (formerly labeled **History**).

    Past conversations are organized by date, with the most recent conversations showing first.

    ## FAQs

    * **Do I need to configure anything to access this new feature?**

      No, this update will roll out to all Agent Desk users.

<Update label="2024 - Default Status for Agents in Voice and Agent Desk">
  ## Default Status for Agents in Voice and Agent Desk

  Administrators can configure a default status for agents for every time they log in.

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-0ba5c13b-559b-7208-74fb-bee60de78107.png" />
  </Frame>

  *Active status selected by default in the Status selection menu.*

  By default, when agents log in to the platform, they inherit the same status they had when they last logged out. This behavior often leads to downtime if the agents fail to update their status to an active state, creating backlogs in queues as there are fewer agents to allocate chats to than there should be.

  This feature allows customers to set a default status, such as available, every time an agent logs in. Administrators can configure this default status for both Voice and Agent desks.

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    After enabling this feature, whenever an agent logs back into Voice or Agent Desk, their status is automatically changed to a configured default status.

    **Configuration**

    To automatically set a default status for agents when they log in, contact your ASAPP account team.

    ## FAQs

    1. **Would agents always get a default status even if I don't configure one?**

       No. If you don't configure a default status, your agents will continue to have the same status they had when they last logged out.

    2. **Can I choose any default status?**
       Yes. Although setting a default status of "active" would prevent possible delays in assigning messages from a queue, you can configure whatever status you need.

<Update label="2024 - Transfer to Paused Queues in Agent Desk">
  ## Transfer to Paused Queues in Agent Desk

  Agents now have the ability to transfer customers to a paused queue.

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-fe379296-a2d6-4add-d8c6-c0b38850c45b.png" />
  </Frame>

  In some cases, the only agents that can properly address a customer's issue are part of a queue that is temporarily paused. To ensure that agents can always redirect customers to the applicable queue, this feature allows agents to transfer customers to a paused queue, even if the wait times are long.

  This feature prevents poor customer experience by telling customers to reach out later or sending them to a queue that cannot appropriately help them.

  It also saves agents time by enabling them to route the customer to the proper queue when they cannot address the issue.

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    Administrators might pause a queue if they detect they are getting a higher demand than expected.
    When enabled, paused queues appear in the agent's transfer menu with a label indicating their status so that agents can identify them.

    <Note>
      When transferring a customer to a paused queue, the customer gets placed at the end of that queue.
    </Note>

    **Configuration**

    To enable your agents to transfer customers to a paused queue, contact your ASAPP account team.

<Update label="2024 - Disable Transfer to Same Queue in Agent Desk">
  ## Disable Transfer to Same Queue in Agent Desk

  Agent Desk can prevent agents from transferring a customer to another agent in the same queue.

  </Frame>

  In some situations, transferring customers to the same queue they were waiting in can cause a poor customer experience.

  Additionally, agents might transfer customers to the same queue to unassign themselves from the case, causing other agents to have to pick up new or complicated cases.

  This feature gives administrators more flexibility in configuring which queues are available to their agents for transfer. It also prevents agents from transferring customers with difficult or time-consuming requests to another agent.

  Overall, this feature ensures a better customer experience by preventing possible delays by transferring waiting customers to the same queue.

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    Enabling this feature removes the queue where the issue is assigned from the transfer menu.

    <Note>
      The transfer menu will still show other queues that the agent is assigned to.

New updates and improvements for ASAPP Messaging - Insights Manager

<Update label="2025 - Overflow Queue Routing">
  ## Overflow Queue Routing

  Administrators can redirect the traffic from one queue to another queue based on two different rules, namely: business hours and agent availability.

  **Business Hours Rule**

  The chat traffic from queue A is redirected to queue B when it is later than the open operating business hours for queue B.

  **Agent Availability Rule**

  The chat traffic from queue A is redirected to queue B when there is no available agent serving queue A.

  Queue Routing improves:

  * Reduce estimated wait time for end-customers
  * Support closed queues when it is a legal requirement

  <Note>
    Admins can choose to redirect traffic from Queue A to Queue B based on a rule configuration which is set by an ASAPP representative.
  </Note>
</Update>

<Update label="2025 - Bulk Close and Transfer Chats">
  ## Bulk Close and Transfer Chats

  ASAPP introduces bulk chat management features in Live Insights to help alleviate queues experiencing unusual activity or high traffic.

  These features include:

  * Bulk Transfer: Transfer all chats from one queue to another to redistribute traffic
  * Bulk Close: End all chats in a queue to quickly address unusual activity

  The features are accessible through dropdown menus and modal interfaces in Live Insights.

  <Accordion title="How it Works">
    ## How it Works

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/insights-manager/bulkchats.png" />
    </Frame>

    ### Bulk Chat Transfer

    A user sees a dropdown list and selects the “Transfer all chats” item from the dropdown menu.

    A queue selection modal appears to ask: “Select the queue which you want to transfer all chats to?” and they see a downdrop list of all the queue names and need to select a queue name and click transfer chats button.

    A toast message appears informing the user that all chats have been transferred.

    The end customer does not see a change on their side and assumes they are still waiting in a queue.

    ### Bulk Chat Closure

    A user clicks on the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner of the queue card they want to impact.

    The user sees a dropdown list and selects the “End all chats” item from the dropdown menu. A confirmation modal appears to ask: “Are you sure you want to end all chats in this queue?” and they need to select confirm/yes to complete the action of ending all chats.

    A toast message appears informing the user that all chats are ended.

    The end customer sees the normal “Conversation has  ended” component.
  </Accordion>
</Update>

<Update label="2025 - Grouping Data and Filtering">
  ## Data Access Control via SSO Groups

  Users are assigned to groups based on their SSO/SAML credentials, which determines their data access across Live Insights, Conversation Manager, and User Management.

  Organizations provide four attributes per user (BPO, Product, Role, Location) which ASAPP uses to construct group names and manage access:

  * BPO users see only chats they service
  * Workforce Management users see all chats, metrics and agents for their BPO
  * Agents see only their own chats and data
  * Managers see chats for their assigned teams

  ASAPP maintains the group structure to enable filtering and queue association. All filters are defined by user SSO attributes.
</Update>

<Update label="2024 - Live Insights Metrics">
  ## Live Insights Metrics

  Two new monitoring features were added to Live Insights:

  * Average First Response Time metric in queue cards tracks customer wait time for initial agent response
  * SLA column in conversation tables shows if response times meet service level agreements

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-bed027eb-466d-190c-9173-154d3eb33cd6.png" />
  </Frame>

  These additions help workforce managers monitor capacity and meet contractual SLA commitments.

  <Accordion title="How it Works">
    ## How it Works

    Workforce management team monitors two key live metrics which are not present in ASAPP's Live Insights.

    Some organizations require that the First Response time be within 2 minutes. In order to monitor whether they're meeting this SLA they have a metric named 'Average First Response Time' (definition: the average time consumers wait for the first human response in a conversation).

    ASAPP will add a metric named 'Average First Response Time' to each queue card in Live Insights.

    <Note>
      The metric is calculated as 'Average First Response Time'= queue wait time + agent time to first response
    </Note>

    Organizations can monitor which chats have a response time longer than 2 minutes. ASAPP will add a response time column in the conversations tab within the queue card found in Live Insights. The calculation will be Response time= SLA (2 minutes)- response time.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-abb8b24f-933e-71f5-69b3-9ccfd5ba2ca7.png" />

<Update label="2024 - Team and Location tables for Live Insights">
  ## Team and Location tables for Live Insights

  Live Insights now offers a Team and a Locations tab with filtering options that helps to oversee the management of teams and agents. Each tab shows the size and occupancy of each result.

  Customers assign staff to their queues from various sites/BPOs, which complicates tracking the real-time performance of their agents for administrators. They lack visibility into agent behaviors, outages, and staffing levels across different geographic locations.

  Additionally, supervisors are sometimes required to provide hourly updates on agent status (active, on lunch, etc.), necessitating an easy method for accessing this information. The additional teams and location tabs in insights manager make the administrators task of managing their teams across various locations easier and more efficient.

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-d3598481-1963-4e8a-702e-ba299ce584f2.png" />
  </Frame>

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ## How It Works

    Supervisors can track the following:

    ### Live Insights

    * **Team Tab**
    * **Locations Tab**

    ### Procedure

    The administrator can see a list of agents after they have clicked into a particular queue, then selected Performance from the left-hand panel and clicked into the Agents icon on the right-hand panel.

    They can further oversee results by performance metrics of the current day and filter both the agent list and metrics by any of the following attributes:

    1. **Agent Name**
    2. **Location**
    3. **Team**
    4. **Status**

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-dac80f45-73af-d191-2570-4d26c5a62949.png" />
    </Frame>

    ### Management Capabilities

    **Filtering by location**

    Each location provides updates of performance and agents names.

    **Filtering by site**

    Each administrator can provide an hourly update of how many agents are active, on lunch, or in a different state as well as view corresponding metrics

    ### Feature Configuration

    All information on which location and teams an agent belongs to is sourced through the SSO integration with ASAPP. Customers that require any changes to the data should change the respective attribute being passed to ASAPP.

    Please contact your ASAPP representative for further information.

# Configuring Generative Agent
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring

Learn how to configure GenerativeAgent

Configure how GenerativeAgent interacts with end users and define its behaviors and actions. You have full control over its capabilities and communication style.

When GenerativeAgent engages in a conversation, it starts by conversing with the user to understand their needs or objectives. It then consults its available Tasks list and selects the appropriate task to assist the user. If no suitable task is found, it escalates to a human agent.

Follow these steps to configure GenerativeAgent:

1. Define the scope for GenerativeAgent
2. Configure core conversation settings
3. Create Tasks
4. Create Functions for those Tasks
5. Connect your Knowledge Base
6. Deploy your changes

After configuration, use the [Previewer](/generativeagent/configuring/previewer) to test GenerativeAgent and make further refinements.

## Accessing the AI Console

Configuring GenerativeAgent requires access to our AI Console, our dashboard for configuring and managing ASAPP. You should have received login credentials from your ASAPP team. If not, please contact them for access.

## Step 1: Define the Scope

Define a clear scope to ensure GenerativeAgent provides safe and accurate assistance.

Consider and decide on:

* The voice or tone GenerativeAgent will use
* The types of issues or actions you want GenerativeAgent to handle (represented as **Tasks**)
* Which APIs your organization needs to expose for GenerativeAgent to address those Tasks (called **Functions**)

A **Task** is any issue or action you want GenerativeAgent to handle. Define a set of instructions in human language, and add one or **Functions**, which are the tools GenerativeAgent can use for that task.

A **Function** is an API call given to GenerativeAgent to fetch data or perform an action. Once you've mapped out the APIs, Functions, and Tasks, use the GenerativeAgent UI to enter your configuration.

## Step 2: Configure Core Conversation Settings

Configure the Core Conversation settings, including:

* Your company name for GenerativeAgent to use
* The welcome message for new customer connections
* How GenerativeAgent should refer to itself
* How your human agents are referred to
* A sentence explaining GenerativeAgent's desired tone

Work with your ASAPP team to configure these settings.

## Step 3: Create Tasks

Tasks are the foundation of how GenerativeAgent performs. This is often where you will spend most of your time when configuring GenerativeAgent. When analyzing a conversation, GenerativeAgent selects the appropriate task and follows its instructions.

To define a Task:

1. Navigate to the Tasks page
2. Click "Create task"
3. Provide the following information:
   * Task name
   * Task selector description
   * Task message (optional)
   * General Instructions
   * Functions the task should use

<Note>
  You can specify knowledge base metadata to restrict GenerativeAgent to using only articles with matching metadata.
</Note>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-91a26448-6a25-8ae7-594e-595572a8c258.png" alt="GenerativeAgent Example" />
</Frame>

### Improving Tasks

As you configure tasks, refer to [Improving Tasks](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/improving) for strategies and tools to improve task performance.

## Step 4: Create Functions

Functions enable your GenerativeAgent to perform actions similar to a live agent. For example, an airline might need Functions to check refund eligibility and process refunds.

Functions must point to specific [API Connections](/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis) and versions. API Connections contain technical details for connecting to specific API endpoints.

<Tip>
  You can opt to point to a live API Connection later by choosing "integrate later" and use a Mock API
</Tip>

To create a function:

1. Navigate to the Functions page
2. Click "Create Function"
3. Provide the following information:
   * Function name
   * Description of how GenerativeAgent should use this function
   * The API Connection to use (default is the latest version)
4. Choose the Function connection type
   * **Connect to an API**: Enable GenerativeAgent to call an API to fetch data or perform an action
   * **Create a Mock API Function**: Define an ideal API interaction for GenerativeAgent before connecting to a real API
   * **Set Variable Functions**: Enable GenerativeAgent to store conversation data as reference variables for future use
   * **System Transfer Functions**: Let GenerativeAgent signal that it's finished or needs to hand control back to an external system

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Connect to an API">
    Under "Choose an API":

    1. Select one of your existing [API connections](/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis).
       * (Optional) Confirm or adjust which version of the API to use if multiple are available.
    2. Save the Function.
       * GenerativeAgent will call the real API during interactions.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Create a Mock API Function">
    You can define an ideal API interaction for GenerativeAgent before connecting to a real API.

    Use a [Mock API Function](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/mock-api) to define data before using a real connection.

    You can replace the Mock call with an existing API or [Create an API Connection](/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis) at any time.

    Under "Choose an API":

    1. Click on “Integrate later”
    2. Define your request parameters in JSON schema format

       <Tip>
         You can pick a template from the “Examples” dropdown or start with a blank schema.

         Make sure your JSON is valid; GenerativeAgent will not let you save if the schema is invalid
       </Tip>
    3. Save your Function.

    * You will see a preview of your defined parameters.

    <Note>
      You can replace the Mock API schema with a real API connection at any time.
      This makes for a seamless transition to live systems.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Set Variable Functions">
    Save a value from  the conversation with a [Variable Function](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/set-variable). This is helpful for storing data like a user's account number, or compute conditional logic (e.g., whether a child is eligible as a lap child).

    1. Select "Set variable" function type.
    2. Define the input GenerativeAgent should use when calling the function.
    3. Add the variables you would like to set.
       * This is defined as a string but allows for [Jinja templating](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/set-variable#step-5-specify-set-variables) for advanced use cases.
    4. Save the Function.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="System Transfer Functions">
    Signal that control should be transferred from GenerativeAgent to an external system with a [System Transfer Function](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/system-transfer). This is helpful for ending conversations or handing control back to external systems with relevant conversation data.

    1. Select "System transfer" function type.
    2. Define the input GenerativeAgent should use when calling the function.
    3. (Optionally) Add any variables you would like to set.
    4. Save your Function.
       * You will see a preview of your defined parameters.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Connect your Knowledge Base

Connect your [knowledge base](/generativeagent/configuring/connecting-your-knowledge-base) to ASAPP and determine what information GenerativeAgent should use when assisting users.

## Step 6: Deploy Changes

After configuring GenerativeAgent, deploy your changes. You have two environments and a draft mode:

* **Draft**: Changes are automatically available for testing with Previewer
* **Sandbox**: Test GenerativeAgent with your real APIs and perform end-to-end testing
* **Production**: Serve live traffic to your end users

# Connecting Your APIs
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis

Learn how to connect your APIs to GenerativeAgent with API Connections

GenerativeAgent can call your APIs to get data or perform actions through **API Connections**. These connections allow GenerativeAgent to handle complex tasks like looking up account information or booking flights.

Our API Connection tooling lets you transform your existing APIs into LLM-friendly interfaces that GenerativeAgent can use effectively. Unlike other providers that require you to create new simplified APIs specifically for LLM use, ASAPP's approach lets you leverage your current infrastructure without additional development work.

  Typically, a developer or other technical user will create API Connections. If you need help, reach out to your ASAPP team.
</Note>

## Understanding API Connections

API Connections are the bridge between your GenerativeAgent and your external APIs. They allow your agent to interact with your existing systems and services, just like a human agent would.

### How API Connections Fit In

GenerativeAgent uses a hierarchical structure to organize its capabilities:

1. **Tasks**: High-level instructions that tell GenerativeAgent what to do. A task can have one or more functions.
2. **Functions**: Tools that help GenerativeAgent complete tasks. A function can point to a single API Connection.
3. **API Connections**: Configurations that enable Functions to interact with your APIs.

</Frame>

### Core Components

Each API Connection consists of three main parts that work together:

1. **API Source**:
   * Handles the technical details of calling your API
   * Manages authentication and security
   * Configures environment-specific settings (sandbox/production)

2. **Request Interface**:
   * Defines what information GenerativeAgent can send
   * Transforms GenerativeAgent's requests into your API's format
   * Includes testing tools to verify the transformation

3. **Response Interface**:
   * Controls what data GenerativeAgent receives
   * Transforms the API response to a GenerativeAgent friendly format
   * Includes testing tools to verify the transformation

## Create an API Connections

To create an API Connection, you need to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the API Integration Hub">
    1. Navigate to **API Integration Hub** in your dashboard
    2. Select the **API Connections** tab
    3. Click the **Create Connection** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select or Upload Your API Specification">
    Every API Connection requires an [OpenAPI specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) that defines your API endpoints and structure.

    * Choose an existing API spec from your previously uploaded API Specs, or
    * Upload a new OpenAPI specification file

    <Note>
      We support any API that uses JSON for requests and responses.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Basic Details">
    Provide the essential information for your connection:

    * **Name**: A descriptive name for the API Connection
    * **Description**: Brief explanation of the connection's purpose
    * **Endpoint**: Select the specific API endpoint from your specification

    <Warning>
      Only endpoints with JSON request and response bodies are supported.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the API Source">
    After creation, you'll be taken to the API Source configuration page. Here you'll need to:

    1. Set up [authentication methods](#authentication)
    2. Configure [environment settings](#environment-settings)
    3. Define [error handling](#error-handling) rules
    4. Add any required [static headers](#headers)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Request and Response Interfaces">
    Configure how GenerativeAgent interacts with your API:

    1. Define the [Request Interface](#request-interface):
       * Specify the schema GenerativeAgent will use
       * Create request transformations
       * Test with sample requests
    2. Configure the [Response Interface](#response-interface):
       * Define the response schema
       * Set up response transformations
       * Validate with sample responses
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Validate">
    Before finalizing your API Connection:

    1. Run test requests in the sandbox environment
    2. Verify transformations work as expected
    3. Check error handling behavior
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link to Functions">
    Once your API Connection is configured and tested, you can [reference it in a Function](/generativeagent/configuring#step-4-create-functions) to enable GenerativeAgent to use the API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Request Interface

The Request Interface defines how GenerativeAgent interacts with your API. It consists of three key components that work together to enable effective API communication.

* [Request Schema](#request-schema): The schema of the data that GenerativeAgent can send to your API.
* [Request Transformation](#request-transformation): The transformation that will apply to the data before sending it to your API.
* [Testing Interface](#request-testing): The interface that allows you to test the request transformation with different inputs.

</Frame>

### Request Schema

The Request Schema specifies the structure of data that GenerativeAgent can send to your API. This schema should be designed for optimal LLM interaction.

<Warning>
  This schema is NOT the schema of the API. This is the schema of that is shown to GenerativeAgent.
</Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  When first created, the Request Schema is a 1-1 mapping to the underlying API spec.
</Note>

### Request Transformation

The Request Transformation converts GenerativeAgent's request into the format your API expects. This is done using [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) expressions.

<Note>
  When first created, the Request Transformation is a 1-1 mapping to the underlying API spec.
</Note>

  <img width="500px" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/connect-apis/request-interface.png" alt="Request Interface Configuration" />
</Frame>

**Common Transformation Patterns**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Field Mapping">
    ```javascript
    {
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "pathParameters": {
        "userId": request.id
      },
      "queryParameters": {
        "include": "details,preferences"
      },
      "body": {
        "name": request.userName,
        "email": request.userEmail
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Formatting">
    ```javascript
    {
      "body": {
        // Convert date to ISO format
        "timestamp": $toMillis(request.date),
        // Uppercase a value
        "region": $uppercase(request.country),
        // Join array values
        "tags": $join(request.categories, ",")
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conditional Logic">
    ```javascript
    {
      "body": {
        // Include field only if present
        "optional_field": $exists(request.someField) ? request.someField : undefined,
        // Transform based on condition
        "status": request.isActive = true ? "ACTIVE" : "INACTIVE"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Request Testing

Thoroughly test your request transformations to ensure GenerativeAgent can send the correct data to your API.

The API Connection can not be saved until the request transformation has a successful test.

**Testing Best Practices**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Various Scenarios">
    ```json
    // Test 1: Minimal valid request
    {
      "customerId": "123",
      "action": "view"
    }

    // Test 2: Full request with all fields
    {
      "customerId": "123",
      "action": "update",
      "data": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate Error Cases">
    * Test with missing required fields
    * Verify invalid data handling
    * Check boundary conditions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Sandbox Environment">
    By Default, the API Connection testing is local. You can test against actual API endpoints by setting "Run test in" to Sandbox.

    * Test against actual API endpoints
    * Verify complete request flow
    * Check response handling
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Response Interface

The Response Interface determines how API responses are processed and presented to GenerativeAgent. A well-designed response interface makes it easier for GenerativeAgent to understand and use the API's data effectively.

There are three main components to the response interface:

* [Response Schema](#response-schema): The JSON schema for the data returned to GenerativeAgent from the API.
* [Response Transformation](#response-transformation): A JSONata transformation where the API response is transformed into the response given to GenerativeAgent.
* [Test Response](#response-testing): The testing panel to test the response transformation with different API responses and see the output.

  <img width="500px" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/connect-apis/response-interface.png" alt="Response Interface Configuration" />
</Frame>

### Response Schema

The Response Schema defines the structure of data that GenerativeAgent will receive. Focus on creating clear, simple schemas that are optimized for LLM processing.

<Warning>
  The Response Schema is NOT the schema of the underlying API. This is the schema of what is returned to GenerativeAgent.
</Warning>

**Schema Design Principles**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focus on Essential Data">
    ```json
    // Good - Only relevant fields
    {
      "orderStatus": "shipped",
      "estimatedDelivery": "2024-03-20",
      "trackingNumber": "1Z999AA1234567890"
    }

    // Avoid - Including unnecessary details
    {
      "orderStatus": "shipped",
      "estimatedDelivery": "2024-03-20",
      "trackingNumber": "1Z999AA1234567890",
      "internalId": "ord_123",
      "systemMetadata": { /* ... */ },
      "auditLog": [ /* ... */ ]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Clear Data Types">
    ```json
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "temperature": {
          "type": "number",
          "description": "Current temperature in Celsius"
        },
        "isOpen": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "description": "Whether the store is currently open"
        },
        "lastUpdated": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "date-time",
          "description": "When this information was last updated"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standardize Formats">
    * Use consistent date/time formats
    * Normalize enumerated values
    * Use standard units of measurement
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  When first created, the Response Schema is a 1-1 mapping to the underlying API spec.
</Note>

### Response Transformation

Transform complex API responses into GenerativeAgent-friendly formats using JSONata. The goal is to simplify and standardize the data.

The Transformation's input is the raw API response. The output is the data that GenerativeAgent will receive and must match the Response Schema.

<Note>
  When first created, the Response Transformation is a 1-1 mapping to the underlying API spec.
</Note>

**Transformation Examples**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Data Mapping">
    ```javascript
    {
      // Extract and rename fields
      "status": clientApiCall.data.orderStatus,
      "items": clientApiCall.data.orderItems.length,
      "total": clientApiCall.data.pricing.total
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Date and Time Formatting">
    ```javascript
    {
      // Convert ISO timestamp to readable format
      "orderDate": $fromMillis($toMillis(clientApiCall.data.created_at), 
                              "[FNn], [MNn] [D1o], [Y]"),
      
      // Format time in 12-hour clock
      "deliveryTime": $fromMillis($toMillis(clientApiCall.data.delivery_eta), 
                                 "[h]:[m01] [P]")
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complex Data Processing">
    ```javascript
    {
      // Calculate order summary
      "orderSummary": {
        "totalItems": $sum(clientApiCall.data.items[*].quantity),
        "uniqueItems": $count(clientApiCall.data.items),
        "hasGiftItems": $exists(clientApiCall.data.items[type="GIFT"])
      },
      
      // Format address components
      "deliveryAddress": $join([
        clientApiCall.data.address.street,
        clientApiCall.data.address.city,
        clientApiCall.data.address.state,
        clientApiCall.data.address.zip
      ], ", ")
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Response Testing

Thoroughly test your response transformations to ensure GenerativeAgent receives well-formatted, useful data.

The API Connection can not be saved until the response transformation has a successful test.

Use [API Mock Users](/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis/mock-apis) to save response from your server to use them in the response testing.

**Testing Strategies**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Different Response Types">
    Make sure to test with different response types your server may respond with.

    This should include happy paths, varied response types, and error paths.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate Data Formatting">
    * Check date/time formatting
    * Verify numeric calculations
    * Test string manipulations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Edge Cases">
    * Handle null/undefined values
    * Process empty arrays/objects
    * Manage missing optional fields
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Redaction

You have the option to redact fields in the request or response from API Connection Logs or Conversation Explorer.

You can redact fields the internal request and response, by adding `x-redact` to a field in the Request Schema or Response Schema. You will need to save the API connection to apply the changes. This will redact the fields in the Conversation Explorer as well.

You can redact fields in the raw API request and response, by flagging the fields in the relevant API Spec:

1. Navigate to API Integration Hub > API Specs
2. Click on the relevant API Spec.
3. Click on the "Parameters" tab and flag
4. Per endpoint, click the fields you want to redact.

Redacting the Spec will redact the fields within the [API Connection Log](#api-connection-logs).

## API Versioning

Every update to an API Connection requires a version change. This is to ensure that no change can be made to an API connection that impacts a live function.

If you make a change to an API connection, the Function that references that API connection will need to be explicitly updated to point to the new version.

## API Connection Logs

We log all requests and responses for API connections. This allows you to see the raw requests and responses, and the transformations that were applied.

Use the logs to debug and understand how API connections are working.

Logs are available in API Integration Hub > API Connection Logs.

## Default API Spec Settings

You can set default information in an API spec. These default settings are used as a template for newly created API connections, copying those settings for all API connections created for that API spec.

You can set the following defaults:

* Headers
* Sandbox Settings:
  * Base URL
  * Authentication Method
* Production Settings:
  * Base URL
  * Authentication Method

You can make further changes to API connections as necessary.

You can also change the defaults and it will not change existing API connections, though the new defaults will be used on any new connections made with that Spec.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to configure API connections for different scenarios.

# Authentication Methods
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis/authentication-methods

Learn how to configure Authentication methods for API connections.

APIs require authentication to control access to their endpoints. GenerativeAgent's API connections support the following authentication methods:

* Basic Authentication (username/password)
* Custom Header Authentication (API keys)
* OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code and Client Credentials flows)

If your APIs require an authentication flow that is not supported by the default authentication methods, we can create a [custom authentication method](#custom-authentication-methods) for you.

## Create an Authentication Method

To Create an Authentication Method:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Integration Hub > Authentication Methods">
    <Note> You may also create an Authentication Method when specifying the API Connection's API Source.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create Authentication Method'" />

  <Step title="Configure the Authentication Method">
    * Provide a name and description
    * Select the Authentication Type matching your API's requirements
    * Configure the type-specific settings detailed in sections below
    * Save the Authentication Method
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to API Connection">
    In the API Connection's API Source tab, select this Authentication Method for Sandbox or Production environments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Authentication

[Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) requires:

* Username
* Password

## Custom Header

Custom headers add authentication data to API requests via HTTP headers. Common implementations include API keys and bearer tokens.

To configure a custom header, you need to:

1. Optionally enable client authentication:
   * Enable if you need to reference values from the client in a header.
   * Set the client data validity duration.
   * Reference client data using `{Auth.*}`
2. Header configuration:
   * Header Name (e.g., "Authorization", "X-API-Key")
   * Header Value (static value or dynamic client data)
     * e.g. `{Auth.client_token}`

## OAuth

OAuth 2.0 provides delegated authorization flows. GenerativeAgent supports:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Authorization Code">
    Required configuration:

    * Authorization Code reference

      This is the location within the [client data](#client-authentication-data) that contains the authorization code.

      `{Auth.authorization_code}`
    * Client ID
    * Client secret
    * Token Request URL
    * Redirect URI

      You can use a variable from the client data for the redirect URI. `{Auth.redirect_uri}`
    * How the client authentication data is passed
      * Basic Auth, or
      * Request Body
    * One or more headers to be added to the request.
      * Header Name
      * Header Value

        Use `{OAuth.access_token}` for the generated access token.

        You can also reference the client data in the header values, using the variable: `{Auth.[auth_data_key]}`.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Client Credentials">
    Required configuration:

    * Client ID
    * Client secret
    * Token Request URL
    * How the client authentication data is passed
      * Basic Auth, or
      * Request Body
    * One or more headers to be added to the request.
      * Header Name
      * Header Value

        Use `{OAuth.access_token}` for the generated access token.

        You can also reference the client data in the header values, using the variable: `{Auth.[auth_data_key]}`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Client Authentication Data

Some authentication flows require dynamic data from the client:

* OAuth authorization codes
* User-specific API keys
* Custom tokens

Client authentication data is provided through:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standalone GenerativeAgent">
    If you are using GenerativeAgent independently of ASAPP Messaging, this Auth data is passed via the [`/authenticate`](/apis/conversations/authenticate-a-user-in-a-conversation) endpoint.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ASAPP Messaging">
    If you are using GenerativeAgent as part of ASAPP Messaging, this Auth data is passed via the [SDKs](/messaging-platform/integrations) depending on the chat channel you are using.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Client Authentication Session

Any authentication method that requires client data will store the auth data for the session.

If the underlying API returns a `401`, we will require new client authentication data for the session.  This is communicated in the GenerativeAgent event stream as an [`authenticationRequested`](/generativeagent/integrate/handling-events#user-authentication-required) event.

## Custom Authentication Methods

If your API requires an authentication flow not supported by our default methods, we can work with you to create a custom solution.

Contact your ASAPP account team to discuss your custom authentication requirements. We'll work with you to build and implement the solution.

### Using Custom Authentication Methods

Custom authentication methods work the same way as standard methods:

* They appear in your authentication method list
* Can be selected when configuring API connections
* Support both sandbox and production environments

<Note>
  Custom authentication methods are read-only configurations. To modify an existing custom authentication method, please work with your ASAPP account team.
</Note>


# Mock API Users
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis/mock-apis

Learn how to mock APIs for testing and development.

While you are building your API Connection, you can use Mock Data to test the API Connection and ensure your transformations are working as expected. This Mock data is saved as a Mock User where you can group mock responses for a given scenario.

<Note>
  The Mock Data is only used when testing the API Connection. Use [Test Users](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/test-users) to test and simulate Tasks and Function responses.
</Note>

## Mock Users

A mock user is a collection of mock responses that simulate how your server may respond. Each endpoint in use by an API Connection can have a mock response defined. By default, the mock user will return the [default mock data](/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis#api-source) defined in the API Connection's API Source.

To Create a Mock User:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Integration Hub > API Mock Users">
    Access the API Mock Users section from the API Integration Hub.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create User'">
    Select the 'Create User' button to start creating a new mock user.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify the User Details">
    Provide the following information:

    * Name of the User
    * Description of the User
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Mock Responses">
    The newly created mock user will have a default mock response for each endpoint in the API Connection.

    You can check "Override Default Mock response" and specify a new mock response.

    Make sure to save the mock user to apply the changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Mock Users

You can use Mock Users to test your transformations. From within the Response interface, you can select the mock user to use in the "Test Response" panel.

<Frame>
  <img width="500px" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/connect-apis/mock-user-selection.png" alt="Mock User Selection" />
</Frame>

This allows you to save common responses from your server in sets of Mock users. As you iterate on your API Connection, you can test your transformation using the same mock responses.

# Connecting your Knowledge Base
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/connecting-your-knowledge-base

Learn how to import and deploy your Knowledge Base for GenerativeAgent.

Your knowledge base is crucial for GenerativeAgent to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to users. You fully control what articles are included with GenerativeAgent.

Manage the knowledge base within the ASAPP dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-6a3bd50e-2c74-39f2-9b37-2453e719cda5.png" />
</Frame>

GenerativeAgent's Knowledge Base is designed to hold information that GenerativeAgent can use to answer customer questions. Customers may ask direct questions like "What is the return policy?" or express confusion that implies a question like "I don't understand what 'eligible for store credit' means").

GenerativeAgent reads a customer message and decides if it should check the Knowledge Base to provide helpful information, even if a questions is implicit. If the message implies a question, GenerativeAgent searches for its response in the Knowledge Base.

To give GenerativeAgent access to your Knowledge Base, you need to:

1. Import your knowledge base into ASAPP
2. Deploy knowledge base articles

<Note>
  We do not recommend  to directly upload an internal agent-facing kowledge base to the GenerativeAgent Knowledge Base.

  GenerativeAgent's Knowledge Base is meant for GenerativeAgent's use. Instructions meant for agents are better suited to task instructions.
</Note>

## Step 1: Importing your Knowledge Base

To enable GenerativeAgent to reference your knowledge base, you need to import it into ASAPP:

* Navigate to GenerativeAgent > Knowledge
* Click "Add content"
* Select between:
  * **Import from URL**
  * **Create Snippet**
  * **Add via API**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Importing Content from URL">
    Importing content from a URL allows you to specify an entry point from where our crawler will crawl the website and create knowledge base articles.

    To import content from a website:

    1. Choose "Import from URL".

    2. Specify the URL of the website in External content URL.

    3. (Optional) Add URL Prefixes and Excluded URLs to control which articles are included.

       <AccordionGroup>
         <Accordion title="Exclude URLs">
           Add one or more URLs to exclude in the "Excluded URL".

           All the articles that direct to the URL will be excluded.

           <Frame>
             <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/ExcludeURLs.png" />
           </Frame>
         </Accordion>

         <Accordion title="URL Prefix">
           The URL Prefix informs our crawler to only create articles from pages that match your prefixes.

           This enables you to use the main URL as the entry point for the crawling but only use pages that match your prefixes.

           <Frame>
             <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/url_prefix.png" />

## Step 2: Deploy your Knowledge Base

Once imported, you need to deploy your Knowledge Base into different environments for GenerativeAgent. This includes reviewing and approving changes. This is crucial as changes to the content in knowledge base may impact how GenerativeAgent responds to your users.

Deploying Knowledge Base occurs as part of the general [GenerativeAgent deployment process](/generativeagent/configuring/deploying-to-generativeagent).

## Imported Articles

Articles imported from URL or APIs need to be reviewed and published before they are available in the Knowledge Base.

If there are any articles pending review, you will see a notification on the top of the Knowledge Base page.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-6980a63d-3e9a-1ddd-1eb3-5395d3ece938.png" />
</Frame>

For each article, you can choose between a cleaned-up or raw version of the article to ensure the content is accurate and appropriate for customer use.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/DetailedReview.png" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  Imported articles that are updated due to a new crawl or API submission will need to be reviewed and published to make the new content available.
</Warning>

## Optimizing GenerativeAgent's Use of Articles

Improve GenerativeAgent's performance with these features:

1. **Query Examples**: Add typical customer questions to ensure relevant content retrieval.
2. **Additional Instructions**: Provide context and clarification for each piece of content.

### Adding Query Examples

1. In the "GenerativeAgent Instructions" column, click "Add query example".
2. Enter common customer questions.
3. Add multiple queries as needed.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-a6143054-92eb-a857-86e5-35434a80907a.png" />
</Frame>

### Providing Additional Instructions

1. Click "Add Instruction".
2. Write a clear description in the "Clarification" field.
3. Provide an example response.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-2165b887-ca8e-b93b-975a-03c9ec4eadbf.png" />
</Frame>

Use Additional Instructions to guide GenerativeAgent's behavior, including preventing unwanted responses.

### Filter with Metadata

You can enhance GenerativeAgent's understanding of your articles by adding metadata. Add metadata onto an article, and for the relevant tasks, add the metadata filers.

When GenerativeAgent follows that task, it will query the Knowledge Base with those metadata filters. This enables you to focus GenerativeAgent's to only look at the relevant articles.

It is recommended to store task-related information in the Knowledge Base with metadata tags.

To add metadata to an article:

1. Navigate to the article.
2. Click "Edit Metadata" to open the Metadata Window.
3. Add or remove keys as necessary.

You can use metadata to ensure certain articles are only used by specific tasks. If an Article and a Task have the same metadata tags, GenerativeAgent will filter and only use that specific relevant information during a conversation.

### Search with Metadata Filters

Apply additional filters to a search with the "Add filter" Button to retrieve and manage Articles in bulk.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/KBSearchBar.png" />
</Frame>

Available filters include:

* Content Source Name
* Content Source Type
* First Activity Range
* Created By
* Last Modified By
* Deployment Status
* Metadata

<Note>
  You can select and apply multiple filters.

  The selected filters combine using "AND" operators for precise search results
</Note>

<Frame>

  <Card title="Integrating GenerativeAgent" href="/generativeagent/integrate" />
</CardGroup>


# Add via API
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/connecting-your-knowledge-base/add-via-api

Learn how to add Knowledge Base articles programmatically using the API

The Knowledge Base Article Submission API offers an alternative to manual creation of article snippets and URL imports. This is especially beneficial for large data sources that are not easily scraped, such as internal knowledge bases or articles within a Content Management System.

All content imported via API follow the [Imported Articles](/generativeagent/configuring/connecting-your-knowledge-base#imported-articles) review process.

## Before you Begin

Before using the Knowledge Base Article Submission API, you need to:

* [Get your API Key Id and Secret](/getting-started/developers#access-api-credentials)
* Ensure your API key has been configured to access Knowledge Base APIs. Reach out to your ASAPP team if you need access enabled.

## Step 1: Create a submission

To import an article via API, you need to create a `submission`. A **submission** is the attempt to import an article. It will still need to be reviewed and published like any other imported article.

To [create a submission](/apis/knowledge-base/create-a-submission), you need to specify:

* `title`: The title of the article
* `content`: The content of the article

<Note>
  There are additional optional fields that can be used to improve the articles such as `url`, `metadata`, and `queryExamples`. More information can be found in the [API Reference](/apis/knowledge-base/create-a-submission).
</Note>

As an example, here's a request to create a submission for an article including additional values such as `url` and `metadata`:

```json
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/knowledge-base/v1/submissions \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'asapp-api-id: <api-key>' \
  --header 'asapp-api-secret: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "title": "5G Data Plan",
  "content": "Our 5G data plans offer lightning-fast speeds and generous data allowances. The Basic 5G plan includes 50GB of data per month, while our Unlimited 5G plan offers truly unlimited data with no speed caps. Both plans include unlimited calls and texts within the country. International roaming can be added for an additional fee.",
  "url": "https://example.com/5g-data-plans",
  "metadata": [
    {
      "key": "department",
      "value": "Customer experience"
    }
  ],
  "queryExamples": [
    "What 5G plans do you offer?",
    "Is there an unlimited 5G plan?"
  ],
  "additionalInstructions": [
    {
      "clarificationInstruction": "Emphasize that 5G coverage may vary by location",
      "exampleResponse": "Our 5G plans offer great speeds and data allowances, but please note that 5G coverage may vary depending on your location. You can check coverage in your area on our website."
    }
  ]
}'
```

## Step 2: Article Processing

The Article Submission API submits the article that will still need to be reviewed and published like any other imported article.

You can check the status of the submission by calling the [Get a Submission](/apis/knowledge-base/retrieve-a-submission) API.

The response will include the `id` of the submission and the `status` of the submission.

```json
{
  "id": "fddd060c-22d7-4aed-acae-8f8dcc093a88",
  "articleId": "8f8dcc09-22d7-4aed-acae-fddd060c3a88",
  "submittedAt": "2024-12-12T00:00:00",
  "title": "5G Data Plan",
  "content": "Our 5G data plans offer lightning-fast speeds and generous data allowances...",
  "status": "PENDING_REVIEW"
}
```

## Step 3: Publication and Updates

Once the submission is approved, the article will be published and become available in the Knowledge Base. The status of the submission will be updated to `ACCEPTED` and you will see it within the ASAPP AI-Console UI.

You can also update the article after it has been published by creating another submission with the same `articleId`.

## Troubleshooting

Common API response codes and their solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="500 - Internal Server Error">
    If you receive a `500` code, there is an issue with the server. Wait and try again.

    If the error persists, contact your ASAPP Team.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="400 - Bad Request">
    The `400` code usually means missing required parameters.

    Recheck your request body and try again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="401 - Unauthorized">
    A `401` code indicates wrong credentials or unconfigured ASAPP credentials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="413 - Request Entity Too Large">
    The request body is too large. Article content is limited to 200,000 Unicode characters.

# Deploying to GenerativeAgent
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/deploying-to-generativeagent

Learn how to deploy GenerativeAgent.

After importing your Knowledge Base and connecting your APIs to GenerativeAgent, you need to manage deployments for GenerativeAgent's use.

You can deploy and undeploy articles and API Connections in the GenerativeAgent UI. There are also options to view version history and roll back changes in the UI.

<Note>
  You must deploy Articles or Functions separately from each other.
</Note>

## Environments

The GenerativeAgent UI offers the following environments to deploy, undeploy, or roll back:

* **Draft**: In this environment, you can try out any article or API connection.
* **Sandbox**: This environment works as a staging version to test GenerativeAgent's responses. You can test the behavior of GenerativeAgent and how it performs tasks or calls functions before deploying to a live environment.
* **Production**: When you deploy to this version, the GenerativeAgent will be live in collaborating in the flows and taking over tasks within your Production environments.

For any version or environment, you can deploy Articles. API Connections are tested via Trial Mode.

This way, you are able to test how GenerativeAgent behaves with a specific article, resource, or API Connection.

## GenerativeAgent Versions

As we continue to update GenerativeAgent, we will release new versions of the core system. You can manage which version of GenerativeAgent is deployed for your organization with Pinned Versions.

On the Settings page, you can choose which version of GenerativeAgent that you want to test in the [Previewer](/generativeagent/configuring/previewer) by selecting a specific version from the Version selector.

This allows you to test how GenerativeAgent would behave under a new version.

* The `Default` version will always point to the latest version of GenerativeAgent.
* Versions with a `stable` badge have been thoroughly tested and will not change.
* Versions with a `beta` badge are in development and may change. Eventually they will become `stable`.

<Note>
  Your GenerativeAgent will use the `Default` version if no other version is pinned.

  Using the `Default` version ensures that GenerativeAgent is always using the safest version with the latest features.
</Note>

If you do want to manually pin your GenerativeAgent to specific version, select the version from Settings and deploy the Settings to your production environment.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/PinnedVersionSelector.png" />
</Frame>

### GenerativeAgent Versions Available

| Version | Description                               |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| v3      | Improved usage of functions               |
| v2      | Improved usage of knowledge base articles |
| v1      | Safe, accurate issue resolution           |

<Note>
  Older versions will eventually become deprecated. ASAPP will reach out to you if you are using a deprecated version to communicate timelines and best practices for migration.
</Note>

## Articles

### Deploy Articles

To Deploy Content to Sandbox or Production environments:

1. Click on Deploy, then choose the root and the target environments.
2. Write any Release Notes that you deem necessary.
3. For Resource, select Knowledge Base.
4. You will be prompted with a list of all resources pulled from your file. Choose the content you want to upload to the Knowledge Base Tooling.
5. Click on Deploy and the content will be saved in the new version.

You can now see a list of all recently deployed content.

### Undeploy Articles

You can undeploy Content from Sandbox or Production environments:

1. Head to the Content Row and click on the ellipsis, then on Undeploy.
2. Select the environments that should undeploy the Resource.

A confirmation message appears every time you successfully undeploy a resource. Keep in mind undeployed resources can be redeployed via individual deployment.

### View Current Articles and Versions

After clicking on a Resource, you can see all of its details. You can also review each Resource's detail per version.

### View Deployment History

Deployment History shows a detailed account of all deployments across environments for each article.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/DeploymentHistory2.png" />
</Frame>

On the Deployment History tab, you can:

1. Toggle between Production and Sandbox to access environment specific deployments.
2. Filter deployment records by time frames.
3. Manage Deployment and rollback to previous versions.

<Note>
  Each deployment entry shows date, time, type, and a brief description of deployment.
</Note>

## API Connections

When you create an API Connection, it will automatically be available for GenerativeAgent. You can test resources that use APIs like Functions into the same environments before going live.

### Trial Mode

ASAPP safely deploys new API use cases to production via Trial Mode.

Trial Mode is configured in a way that if there are multiple APIs configured for a task or a function, GenerativeAgent is only allowed to call the first API.

After GenerativeAgent calls an API, it will immediately escalate to an agent. This way to observe GenerativeAgent's behavior after the API call.

Once you and your ASAPP Team are confident that GenerativeAgent is correctly using API Connections, GenerativeAgent is given full access to use the Connection. After that, Functional Testing is started on the next API Connection.

## Rollbacks

Rollback involves reverting a deployed resource to a previous version or state. Rollbacks restore the previous version of the resource, undoing any changes introduced by the most recent update. Version pointers for each resource indicate the new\_version\_number from the chosen deployment for rollback.

### Undeployment

Undeployment is restricted to individual resources (a task, a function, or an article). It is possible to remove resources from specific environments without deploying any version of them. Undeploying a resource does not change the state of the draft, and the latest modification of the draft is still considered the latest version.

Undeploying also generates a new line item within the deployment history. If a resource is critical for the functioning of other resources or services, undeployment is blocked to prevent system failures or disruptions.

### Edit History

Each resource has a history of all modifications. Edit History can be used to restore a resource to a past version.

### Resource Deletion

Deleting a resource results in the resource becoming inaccessible and invisible on the list. Deletion is prohibited if there are any dependencies, such as a function being utilized by a task. Deletion of deployed resources is not permitted until the resource is undeployed from all the dependent environments to ensure uninterrupted service.

If a resource is critical for the functioning of other resources or services, deletion is blocked to prevent system failures or disruptions.

# Functional Testing
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/functional-testing

Learn how to test GenerativeAgent to ensure it handles customer scenarios correctly before production launch.

Functional Testing is a critical step in evaluating GenerativeAgent after setting requirements for Tasks and Functions. Given the dynamic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), it's essential to validate that GenerativeAgent works as expected in various scenarios. Testing is the best strategy to ensure reliability and performance before launching any task into production.

This testing phase is a crucial part of your integration process. We strongly recommend completing thorough functional testing, with assistance from the ASAPP team, before deploying GenerativeAgent in a live environment. This process involves verifying, validating, and confirming that GenerativeAgent functions as expected across a wide range of potential user interactions.

It's helpful to have a high-level overview of how GenerativeAgent works while planning your testing. GenerativeAgent assumes it is engaging with a customer who has a problem it can help resolve. GenerativeAgent uses a combination of:

* Task Instructions
* API Response Data
* Retrieved Knowledge Base Articles

If GenerativeAgent cannot help the customer or is unsure about what to do, it will offer to escalate to a live agent.

### Acceptance Testing Objectives

* Ensure GenerativeAgent does not make mistakes given expected inputs
* Focus on preventing potential hallucinations or bad inputs
* Ensure GenerativeAgent handles expected customer scenarios correctly

Functional Testing is performed after your ASAPP Team has configured GenerativeAgent Tasks and Functions. You will be able to fully integrate GenerativeAgent into your apps after the tests are passed.

## Testing Process

### Pretesting

In the pretesting phase, keep in mind cases like the following use case scenarios:

Reading a sample of production scenarios for this task:

* Read summaries for 100 sample conversations to understand typical conversations within this use case across both the virtual agent and those that escalate to a live agent
* Have clear should/must-dos for each task
* Have a clear idea of the things that GenerativeAgent should do vs. must do within each task
* Keep in mind the common scenarios you expect users to go through based on the sample of real conversations
* Clear test users to do the testing
* Consider the permutations of test data that are important to cover. For example:
  * Someone with a flight canceled a few minutes ago
  * Someone with two flights, one which is canceled and one which is not
  * Someone with elite status vs. someone with no status

### Testing GenerativeAgent

Once you've completed the pretesting phase, you're ready to start testing GenerativeAgent itself. This phase involves simulating real-world scenarios and interactions to ensure GenerativeAgent performs as expected. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

* Aim to test approximately 100 conversations per use case
* Go through the expected conversation scenarios, as relevant, for each of the test users
* Make sure to operate in a manner that is consistent with the data in the test account you are using
* Formulate questions, based on the sample of conversations, that aim to test the knowledge articles available to GenerativeAgent
* Plan to repeat some scenarios with slight variation to ensure GenerativeAgent responses are consistent (though no response is likely to ever be exactly the same due to its generative nature)

## Example Test

The following is an example scenario of Functional Testing for a task.

### Test Scenario

If a customer asks about their flight status, GenerativeAgent should provide the relevant details.

### Preconditions

A correct confirmation number and last name

### Test Procedure

1. IF a customer asks about their current flight status
2. THEN GenerativeAgent will invoke the flight\_status task
3. AND GenerativeAgent will request the necessary criteria to look up the customer's flight details
4. AND if the customer provides a valid confirmation number and last name
5. THEN GenerativeAgent will call the appropriate API
6. AND GenerativeAgent will retrieve the required information
7. AND GenerativeAgent will inform the customer of their current flight status based on the API response

### Test Objectives

1. Confirm that GenerativeAgent correctly invokes the flight\_status task
2. Verify that GenerativeAgent identifies the necessary information from the customer to verify the flight
3. Ensure that GenerativeAgent requests the required information (confirmation number and last name)
4. Check that the appropriate API is called
5. Validate the information provided by the customer through the API
6. Ensure GenerativeAgent gathers the necessary flight status information
7. Confirm GenerativeAgent accurately communicates the flight status to the customer

This example illustrates the "happy path." But there are other scenarios such as: what if the customer only provides a confirmation number? Can they provide alternative information? What if the customer doesn't have a confirmation number? Consider other potential scenarios and instructions to test against.

## Next Steps

With correct Acceptance Testing, you are ready to support real users.

# Previewer
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/previewer

Learn how to use the Previewer in AI Console to test and refine your GenerativeAgent's behavior

The Previewer in AI Console makes it easy to rapidly iterate on GenerativeAgent's design and provides a quick tool to test GenerativeAgent's capabilities.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-ba75e1fb-7162-d7f5-011f-c806117e64d7.png" alt="AI Console Previewer interface" />
</Frame>

## Testing Draft Changes

When you initially configure GenerativeAgent, you'll often find subtle ways to improve its performance. While you can always make changes, then deploy and test them in sandbox, it's usually easier to try changes with Previewer. Previewer can use any changes across tasks and functions that you have in draft, allowing you to interact with GenerativeAgent using these temporary configurations.

Once you're confident with a set of changes, you can deploy them into sandbox.

### Using Live Preview

The Live Preview feature allows you to test changes in real-time during a conversation. You have the ability to:

* **Regenerate a response**: For a given bot response, regenerate it using the latest state of the draft settings.
* **Send a different message**: For a given customer message, change what is sent to see how GenerativeAgent would respond with that conversation context.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-7e037841-239a-0b66-6c05-f1f301ed206f.png" alt="Live Preview feature in AI Console Previewer" />
</Frame>

### Previewer Environment

Choose the [Environment](/generativeagent/configuring/deploying-to-generativeagent#environments) that GenerativeAgent uses to test and preview a conversation with GenerativeAgent.

Choose between:

* Draft
* Sandbox
* Production

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/ChooseEnvironment.png" />
</Frame>

### Replaying Conversations

During testing and configuration, you may want to replay conversations while trying out changes or validating GenerativeAgent across new versions. In Previewer, you can save the conversation to replay it again in the future.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-8bbbdf91-7ce0-1426-fa95-abc8dc1c17fe.png" alt="Save conversation option in AI Console Previewer" />
</Frame>

## Advanced Settings

Use Previewer's Advanced Settings to further test GenerativeAgent in the Previewer.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/AdvancedSettings.png" />
</Frame>

### Test User Type

Use the test user data or reach out to an existing API Connection.

[Test Users](generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/test-users) allow you to define a scenario and how your API would respond to an API Connection for that scenario. This allows you to try out different Tasks and iterate on tasks definitions or on Functions.

1. **API Connection**: The Previewer test the conversation with mocked data defined by a Test User.
2. **External Endpoint**: The Previewer uses external data from an existing API.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/TestUser.png" />
</Frame>

### Task Name

Choose a specific Task to make GenerativeAgent handle it, instead of allowing GenerativeAgent choose a Task each time the conversation is started.

If you leave the task name blank, then GenerativeAgent will choose the Task by itself.

This way you can test:

1. How GenerativeAgent handles a specific Task
2. How GenerativeAgent chooses Tasks to perform a Function.

`Task name` is also an optional part of the body request in the [GenerativeAgent API](/apis/generativeagent/analyze-conversation) with `/analyze`.

<Tip>
  Head to [Improving Tasks](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/improving) to learn more about the use of Tasks.
</Tip>

### Input Variables

Input Variables allow you to simulate how GenerativeAgent responds when it receives data from a calling application during a conversation.

Use Input Variables to test the use of:

* Entities extracted from a previous system or API call
* Relevant customer metadata
* Conversation context, like a summary of previous interactions
* Instructions on the next steps for a given task

<Note>
  Input variables can be submitted as key-value pairs in JSON format. For optimal configuration, reference the input variables directly in the task instructions to guide GenerativeAgent on how to interpret them
</Note>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/InputVariables.png" />
</Frame>

You can also simulate directly launching the customer into a specific task, instead of allowing GenerativeAgent to choose a task.

<Tip>
  In a scenario where a IVR has already gathered information, you can ensure GenerativeAgent picks up from where the IVR left off.
</Tip>

## Observing GenerativeAgent's Behavior

Previewer gives you insight into the actions that GenerativeAgent is taking. This includes its thoughts during the conversation, the Knowledge Base articles it references, and the API calls it makes.

You can use this information to evaluate the performance of your tasks and functions, making appropriate changes when you want to alter its behavior.

### Turn Inspector

Use the Turn Inspector to examine how instructions are processed within GenerativeAgent.

Inspect the state of the variables, tasks, and instructions in each turn of conversation within the Previewer.

Turn Inspector includes detailed visibility into:

* Active Task Configuration
* Current reference variables
* Precise instruction parsing
* Function call context and parameters
* Execution state at each conversational turn

# Safety and Troubleshooting
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/safety-and-troubleshooting

Learn about GenerativeAgent's safety features and troubleshooting.

GenerativeAgent prioritizes safety in its development. ASAPP ensures accuracy and quality through rigorous testing, continuous updates, and advanced validation to prevent hallucinations. Our team has incorporated Safety Layers that provide benefits such as reliability and response trust. You can take steps to align GenerativeAgent with your organization's goals.

## Safety Layers

GenerativeAgent uses a four-layer safety strategy to prevent irrelevant or harmful responses to customer support queries. The layers also prevent any type of hallucination response from the GenerativeAgent.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/safety-layers.png" alt="Safety Layers Diagram" />
</Frame>

GenerativeAgent's Safety Layers work as follows:

* **Scope**: The Scope layer halts any request that is outside of the reach or the context of GenerativeAgent.
* **Input safety**: This layer defends against any nefarious prompt attempt from a user.
* **Core planning loop**: This layer is where the GenerativeAgent does all of its magic (handling tasks, calling APIs, researching Knowledge Bases) while also restraining from performing any task or sending any reply that's either out of scope, contrary to the desired tone of voice, or that goes against any of your organization policies.
* **Output safety**: This layer defines the response given by GenerativeAgent and assures that any reply protects customer and organization data.

### Input Safety

ASAPP's safety bot protects against manipulation, prompt injection, bad API responses, code/encryption, leakings, and toxic safety risks.

Customers can configure examples that should be classified as safe to improve model accuracy.

By default, GenerativeAgent's in scope capabilities prevent customers from engaging with GenerativeAgent on topics outside of your organization's matters. You can configure topics that GenerativeAgent must not engage with using our [Scope and Safety Tuning](/generativeagent/configuring/safety/scope-and-safety-tuning) tools.

### Output Safety

ASAPP's output bot ensure any output is safe for your organization.

Our TaskBot prompts customers to confirm any action before GenerativeAgent calls identified APIs so the Agent is prevented from performing any action that might impact your organization.

### Ongoing Evaluations

ASAPP runs red team simulations on a periodic basis. This way, we ensure our systems and GenerativeAgents are protected from any type of exploitation or leaks.

These simulations include everything from security exploits to prompts or tasks that might impact your organization in an unintended manner.

**Evaluation Solutions**

ASAPP implements automated tests designed to define the performance and functionality of GenerativeAgent. The Tests simulate a wide range of scenarios to evaluate GenerativeAgent's responses.

### Knowledge Base and APIs

GenerativeAgent's responses are grounded on Knowledge Base articles and APIs to construct reliable responses. It is important to set up these two factors correctly to prevent any type of hallucination. Our tests comprise:

* Measurement: ASAPP continuously tracks a combination of deterministic metrics and AI-driven evaluators for conversations in production.
* Human Oversight: ASAPP's Team actively monitors conversation to ensure accurate and relevant responses.

## Data Security

ASAPP's security protocols protect data at each point of transmission, from first user authentication to secure communications, to our auditing and logging system, all the way to securing the environment when data is at rest in data storage.

Additionally, ASAPP's API gateway solution provides rate limiting, input validation and protects endpoints against direct access, injections, and other attacks.

Access to data by ASAPP teams is tightly constrained and monitored. Strict security protocols protect both ASAPP and our customers.

ASAPP utilizes [custom redaction logic](/security/data-redaction) to remove sensitive data elements from conversations in real-time.


# Scope and Safety Tuning
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/safety/scope-and-safety-tuning

Learn how to customize GenerativeAgent's scope and safety guardrails

GenerativeAgent includes default safety and scope guardrails to keep conversations aligned with business needs and to ensure GenerativeAgent engages only in appropriate topics.

These tools allow you to:

* Define custom categories for what's considered "in-scope"
* Configure input safety categories for allowed customer messages
* Maintain default safety protections while adding organization-specific allowances

</Frame>

## Customizing Scope and Safety Settings

Scope and safety controls are available in the main Settings page of GenerativeAgent. After making any changes to these settings, be sure to test them using the Previewer before deploying to production.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="In-Scope Categories">
    To define valid topics for GenerativeAgent:

    1. Navigate to Settings > In-Scope Categories
    2. Click "Add Category"
    3. Enter a category name
    4. Provide specific examples of acceptable topics/requests
    5. Save your changes

    The default safety and scope guardrails remain active even when adding custom categories. Your configurations help customize permissible interactions while maintaining core safety features.

    <Note>
      If scope settings seem too restrictive, you can add new categories or expand existing ones. Always test changes in the Previewer before deployment.
    </Note>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Input Safety Categories">
    To specify allowed customer message types:

    1. Go to Settings > Input Safety Categories
    2. Click "Add Category"
    3. Define the category name
    4. Add example messages that should be allowed
    5. Include context explaining why these inputs are safe
    6. Save your configuration

# Tasks Best Practices
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/task-best-practices

Improve task writing by following best practices

Before any technical integration with GenerativeAgent, you must first define the tasks and the functions that the GenerativeAgent will perform to help your organization.

**Tasks** are the issues or actions you want generative agent to handle. They are primarily a set of **instructions** and the **Functions** needed to perform the instructions.

* **Instructions** define the business logic and acceptance criteria of a task.
* **Functions** are the set of tools (e.g. APIs) needed to perform a task with its instructions.

The goal of all instructions is to deliver the desired outcome using the minimum number expressions.

## Best Practices

Clearly defining tasks is key in configuring GenerativeAgent, as the GenerativeAgent acts on the tasks you as it to perform and solve customer issues across your apps.

When writing or defining Tasks, have the following methods in mind:

### Know where to place information

Deciding which information belongs in a Tasks or in the Knowledge Base can be challenging. To make it simple, we offer this recommendation as a rule of thumb:

* Task instructions are procedures and course of action for GenerativeAgent.

> Example: "Flip a coin, the result of coin\_flip decides whether the customer kickoffs the game."

* Knowledge Base Articles are a place to hold information and guides on how to make operate during an action.

> Example: "Flipping coins must be quarters, the result of the flip is marked after the coin falls in your hand and stops moving. If the coin falls from your hand, the result is null.""

For example, an example of the Task that uses the `refund_eligibility` API would be:

```
Use the refund_eligibility API to check if the purchase is eligible for a refund. 
If eligible, ask the customer if they want store credit or a refund to their original payment method
```

And the example of the Knowledge Base Article for the Task would be:

```
Refunds typically take 7-10 days to appear on credit card statements. 
Store credit will be sent via email within one hour of issuing the refund.
```

### Format Instructions

Use clear instructions for the Task.

Be consistent in the way you use marks, like Headers or bullet/numbered lists. Use markdown for the task definition.

* Use Headers to organize sections within the instructions
* Use lists for clarity

```json
# Headers
- Task section
- Bullet 2
-- Secondary Section
--- Tertiary Section
--- Tertiary Section 2
Here are instructions on how to use the api calls to solve problems:
# Section
1blah blah blah
# Section
2blah blah blah
```

### Provide Resolution Steps

Enumerate the steps that GenerativeAgent needs to resolve a task.

This provides a logical flow of actions that the GenerativeAgent can use to be more efficient.

Just as a human agent needs to check, read, resolve, and send information to a customer, GenerativeAgent needs these steps to be more detailed.

```json
# Steps to take to check order status
1. Verify Purchase Eligibility
- Check the purchase date to ensure it is within the 30-day refund policy.
- Verify that the item is eligible for a refund
2. Gather Necessary Information
- Ask the customer for their order ID.
3. Check Order Status
- Call the `order_status` function to retrieve the current status of the order.
- Confirm that the order is eligible for a refund.
```

### Define Functions to Call

Functions are the set of APIs needed alongside their instructions.

GenerativeAgent invokes Functions to perform the necessary actions for a task.

Task instructions must outline how and when does GenerativeAgent invokes a Function.

Here is an example of how to call out functions in the task instruction:

Within the "FlightStatus" task, functions might include:

* `trip_details_extract_with_pnr`: Retrieves flight details using the customer's PNR and last name.
* `trip_details_pnr_emails`: Handles email addresses associated with the PNR.
* `send_itinerary_email_as_string`: Sends the trip receipt or itinerary to the customer via email.

Here is how the task instruction would be outlined to use the function:

```json
"The function `trip_details_extract_with_pnr` is used within the 'FlightStatus' task to retrieve the current schedule of a customer's flight using their confirmation code and last name."
```

### API Return Handling

Provide instructions for handle the returns of API Calls after performing a Function.

Use the syntax `(data["APICallName"])` to let GenerativeAgent know that that precise piece of writing is the data return from an API Call.

Here is an example of API Return Handling:

```json
When called, if there is a past due amount, you MUST tell them their exact soft disconnect date (data["softDisconnectDate"]), and let them know that after that day, their service will be shut off, but still be easy to turn back on.
```

### State Policies and Scenarios

Clearly define company policies and outline what GenerativeAgent must do in various scenarios.

Stating Policies ensure consistency and compliance with your Organization's standards.

Remember than a good part of the Policies can be taken from your Knowledge Base.

```json
# Refund eligibility
- Customers can request a refund within 30 days of purchase.
- Refunds will be processed to the original payment method.
- Items must be returned in their original condition.
# Conversational Style
- Always refer to the customer as "customer."
- Do not address the customer by their name or title.
```

### Ensure Knowledge Base Resourcing

Ensure that GenerativeAgent is making use of your Knowledge Base either by API or by the Knowledge Base Tooling in the Generative Agent UI.

Provide the Knowledge Base Resources within the task, so GenerativeAgent references them when active.
Remember that you can try out GenerativeAgent's behavior by using the Previewer.

It is recommended to store task-related information in the Knowledge Base with metadata tags.

You can use metadata to ensure certain articles are only used by specific tasks. If an Article and a Task have the same metadata tags, GenerativeAgent will filter and only use that specific relevant information during a conversation.

### Outline limitations

Be clear about the limitations of each task.

Provide instructions on what to do in scenarios when customers ask for things that go beyond the limits of a task.
This helps GenerativeAgent to manage customer expectations, provide alternative solutions, and switch to tasks that are in line with the customer's needs.

```json
# Limitations
- Cannot process refunds for items purchased more than 30 days ago.
- Redirect customers to the website for refunds involving gift cards.
- No knowledge of specific reasons for payment failures.
```

### Use Conditional Templates

Use [conditional templating](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/conditional-templates) to make parts of the task instructions conditional on reference variables determined from API responses.

This ensures that only the contextually relevant task instructions are available at the right time in the conversation.

```json
{% if data["refundStatus"] == "approved" %}
- Inform the customer that their refund has been approved and will be processed shortly.
{% elif data["refundStatus"] == "pending" %}
- Let the customer know that their refund request is pending and provide an estimated time for resolution.
{% endif %}
```

### Use Reference Variables

[Reference variables](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/reference-variables) let you store and reuse specific data returned from function responses. They are powerful tools for creating dynamic and context-aware tasks.

Once a reference variable is created, you can use it to:

* Conditionally make other Functions available
* Set conditional logic in prompt instructions
* Compare values across different parts of your GenerativeAgent workflow
* Control Function exposure based on data from previous function calls.
* Toggle conditional instructions in your Task s prompt depending on returned data
* Extract and transform values without hard‐coding logic into prompts or code

For example:

```json
val == "COMPLIANT" → returns True if the string is "COMPLIANT"  
val == true or val == false → checks if the value is a boolean true/false
val is not none and val|length > 0 → returns True if val has length > 0  
```

### Create Subtasks

Some tasks might be bigger and more complex than others.

GenerativeAgent is more efficient with cohesive and direct tasks. A good practice for complex tasks is to divide them into subtasks.

For example, to give a refund to a client, GenerativeAgent might need to:

* Confirm the customer's status
* Confirm the policies allow for the refund
* Confirm the refund

```json
For a customer seeking a refund, consider splitting the task into:
OrderStatus: To check the status of the order and communicate the results to the customer.
IssueRefund: To gather the information necessary to process the refund and actually process the refund.
```

### Call Task Switch

As all tasks are outlined, sometimes GenerativeAgent needs to switch from one task to another.

Be explicit about the tasks to switch to, given a context.

```json
# Damage Claims
- For claims regarding damaged products, use use the 'DamageClaims' task
# Exchange Requests
- For exchange inquiries, use the 'ExchangeProducts' task
# No pets rule
- (#rule_1) no dogs in the house
- (#rule_2) no cats outside
- (#rule_3) if either #rule_1 or #rule_2 are broken escalate to agent.
```

### Outline Human Support

State the scenarios where GenerativeAgent needs to escalate the issue to a human agent.

This ensures GenerativeAgent's role in your organization is well contained.

```json
# Escalate to a Human Agent
- Refunds involving high-value items.
- Refunds where payment method issues are detected.
```

You can also state scenarios for HILA:

```json
# Call HILA and wait on approval
- Refunds of purchases older than 30 days
- Cancelation of high-value purchases
```

### Keep it simple

It is generally best to keep task instructions focused and concise.

The more details you add to tasks, the greater the chance that essential instructions could be overlooked or diluted. GenerativeAgent might not follow the most important steps as precisely if the instructions are too long or complex.

So, we recommend to not place many task-relevant information directly into the task. It is better to make use of the other tools GenerativeAgent has at your disposal, like metadata, Functions, and the Knowledge Base.

<Note>
  We do not recommend  to directly upload an internal agent-facing knowledge base to the GenerativeAgent Knowledge Base.

  GenerativeAgent's Knowledge Base is meant for GenerativeAgent's use. Instructions meant for agents are better suited to task instructions.
</Note>


# Conditional Templates
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/conditional-templates



Conditional Templates allow you use saved values from API Calls to change the instructions on a given task.

GenerativeAgent uses the conditional templates to render API and Prompt instructions based on the conditions and values in each template.

<Note>
  Conditional Templates must be referenced in Jinja2 templating language conditional statements.
  Head to the [Jinja Documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/) to dive further into Conditional Statements
</Note>

## Write Conditional Templates

Conditional templating supports rendering based on the presence of some data in an API Response Model Action.

This data is pulled at run-time from the input model context (list of ModelActions) and stored in reference variables that can be used in Jinja2 conditional statements.

<Note>
  If you want to render based on ModelActions that are not API Responses, it will require further help from your ASAPP Team.
</Note>

Write a Conditional Template:

1. Identify the Function and the keypath to the value from the API response you would like to conditionally render on.
2. Add a reference var to a list of reference\_vars on the Function in the company's functions.yaml.
   It should include name and response\_keypath at minimum, with the response\_keypath format being response.\<your\_keypath>.
   You can optionally define a transform expression with val as the keypath value to be transformed . Note that these reference vars are used across the company's Tasks, so the name parameter needs to be unique.
3. Leverage the conditional in two places by pulling from vars.get("my\_reference\_var\_name"):
   In a Task, you can add Jinja2 conditional statements in the prompt\_instructions and define conditions for each of the TaskFunctions, so they only render when it evaluates to True.
   Conditions on TaskFunctions are optional, and functions will always render in the final prompt if there are no conditions provided.
   In a Function, you can add Jinja2 conditional statements to the Function's description

## Use Case Example - Mobile Bill

What this use case example accomplishes is to make GenerativeAgente behave as follows:

* If CPNI compliance is unknown, only render the identity API without its description about checking the response field "data\['cpniCompliance']", and render in the prompt\_instructions that tell the LLM it must first confirm the customer is CPNI compliant.
* If a customer is not CPNI compliant, only render the identity API with its description about checking the response field "data\['cpniCompliance']", and do not render in the prompt\_instructions that tell the LLM it must first confirm the customer is CPNI compliant.
* If a customer is CPNI compliant, do not render the identity API and render the APIs that require CPNI compliance instead, and do not render in the prompt\_instructions that tell the LLM it must first confirm the customer is CPNI compliant.

```json
identity:
  name: identity
  lexicon_name: identity-genagent
  lexicon_type: entity
  description: |:-
    Use this API call to determine whether you can discuss billing or account information with the customer. 
    {%- if not vars.get("compliance_unknown") and not vars.get("is_compliant") %}
    - If the data['cpniCompliance'] does not return "COMPLIANT", you cannot discuss account or billing information with the customer.
    {%- endif %}
  message_before: Give me a few seconds while I pull up your account.
  reference_vars:
    - name: is_compliant # this variable to be used in conditions
      response_keypath: response.cpniCompliance # keypath to the value from the response
      transform: val == "COMPLIANT" # val is passed in from the keypath for the transform
    - name: compliance_unknown
      response_keypath: response.cpniCompliance
      transform: val == None
```

```json
dname: MobileBill
selector_description: For Mobile billing inquiries only, see the current billing situation and status of your Spectrum mobile account(s), including dues, balances, important dates and more.
prompt_instructions: |:-
  - If the customer expresses anything about their question not being answered (EXAMPLES: "That didn't answer my question" "My question wasn't answered"), *before doing anything else* ask them for more details
  - The APIs in these instructions and the information they return MUST only be used to answer basic questions about a mobile bill or statements.
  - They MUST NOT be used to answer any out-of-scope concerns like the following:
  - - To answer questions related to cable (internet, TV, landline), use the command `APICALL change_task(task_name="CableBill")` to switch to the CableBill flow.
  - - concerns about why services are not working
  - - concerns about when service will be restored
  - - inquiries about where bills are being sent, or sending confirmation emails
  - - updating billing address
  {%- if vars.get("compliance_unknown") %}
  - You must confirm that a customer is CPNI compliant before telling them anything about their account or billing info. The only way to do this is via the identity() api as described below.
  - -  Note: Authentication is not the same as being CPNI compliant. You still need to use the identity() api to confirm that a customer is CPNI compliant if they are authenticated.
  {%- endif %}
  - Mobile services are billed seperately from Cable (Internet, TV, and Home phone) services.
functions:
  - name: identity
    conditions: not vars.get("is_compliant")
  - name: mobile_current_balance
    conditions: vars.get("is_compliant")
    instructions: |:-
      - Anytime you call `mobile_current_balance`, you should also call `mobile_current_statement`
  - name: mobile_current_statement
    conditions: vars.get("is_compliant")
  - name: mobile_statements
    conditions: vars.get("is_compliant")
    instructions: |:-
      - When describing payments, your response to the customer must not imply that you know the purpose or reason for any payment or how it will affect the account.
      - If you think you have found a payment the customer is referring to, ask the customer if it's the right payment, but do not say anything to confirm the customer's impression of the payment or what it is for.
  - name: mobile_specific_statement
    conditions: vars.get("is_compliant")
```


# Enter a Specific Task
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/enter-specific-task

Learn how to enter a specific task for GenerativeAgent

When GenerativeAgent analyzes a conversation, by default, it will automatically select the appropriate task and follow its instruction.

If your system already knows which task to use, you can specify it by using the `taskName` attribute in the [`/analyze` request](/apis/generativeagent/analyze-conversation).

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze \

# Input Variables
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/input-variables

Learn how to pass information from your application to GenerativeAgent.

Input Variables allow you to provide contextual information to GenerativeAgent when analyzing a conversation. This is the main way to pass information from your application to GenerativeAgent. These variables can then be referenced in the task instructions and functions.

Use Input Variables provide GenerativeAgent with context information like:

* Entities extracted from a previous system or API call
* Relevant customer metadata
* Conversation context, like a summary of previous interactions
* Instructions on the next steps for a given task

## Add Input Variables to a conversation

To add input variables to a conversation, you needs to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Input Variables with /analyze">
    Call [`analyze`](/apis/generativeagent/analyze-conversation), adding the `inputVariables` attributes. `inputVariables` is an untyped JSON object and you can pass any key-value pairs. You need to ensure you are consistent in the key names you use between `/analyze` and the task instructions.

    With each call, any new input variable is added to the conversation context.

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'asapp-api-id: <api-key>' \
      --header 'asapp-api-secret: <api-key>' \
      --data '{
      "conversationId": "01BX5ZZKBKACTAV9WEVGEMMVS0",
      "message": {
        "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
        "sender": {
          "role": "agent",
          "externalId": 123
        },
        "timestamp": "2021-11-23T12:13:14.555Z"
      },
      "taskName": "UpgradePlan",
      "inputVariables": {
        "context": "Customer called to upgrade their current plan to GOLD",
        "customer_info": {
          "current_plan": "SILVER",
          "customer_since": "2020-01-01"
        }
      }
    }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference Input Variables in Task Instructions">
    Once the Input Variables are added to the conversation, they are made part of GenerativeAgents' Context. GenerativeAgent will consider them when interacting with your users.

    You can also reference them directly in the task instructions.

    ```
    The customer has a plan status of {{ input_vars.get("customer_info.current_plan") }}
    ```

    Input variables can be used as part of [Conditional Templates](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/conditional-templates).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add Input Variables in the Previewer

While you are iterating on your tasks, you simulate how GenerativeAgent responds with added Input Variables in the [Previewer](/generativeagent/configuring/previewer#input-variables)

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/InputVariables.png" />
</Frame>

You can also simulate directly launching the customer into a specific task, instead of allowing GenerativeAgent to choose a task.

<Tip>
  In a scenario where a IVR has already gathered information, you can ensure GenerativeAgent picks up from where the IVR left off.
</Tip>


# Keep Fields
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/keep-fields

Learn how to keep fields from API responses so GenerativeAgent can use them for more calls

The history of responses in conversations is part of the data that GenerativeAgent continually uses as context to reply, analyze, and respond to your customers.

As Generative Agent makes constant calls to APIs via Functions, response history can be extended. This can result in a lot of data in the conversation history and can make it more difficult for GenerativeAgent to identify the most relevant fields or data to use in subsequent calls.

While you can control this by specifying the data to return within the underlying API Connection, you can also use a slightly different set of fields for multiple Tasks using the same Function.

With the Keep Fields functionality you can configure Keep Fields to change the data kept in the context for that Task.

<Warning>
  Most users will not need to configure Keep Fields and instead rely on specifying the fields to keep in the underlying [API Connection](/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis).
</Warning>

## Configure a Keep Field

Keep Fields are part of the Function page.

To configure a Keep Field:

1. Identify the Function within a Task
   * Determine the function that you want to configure fields to keep.
2. Go to the Keep Field Configuration
   * In the Function settings, see the Keep Configuration table.
3. Specify Keep Fields
   * List all the fields that this function should retain. Use a nested list format to specify the paths of the fields you want to keep.

<Note>
  Each path should be an array of strings representing the keys to traverse in the JSON structure.
</Note>

Inside of the Function options, you can add Keep Fields.

### Specify fields within objects

JSON responses on API Connections often contain arrays of objects.

To specify fields within these objects, you need to indicate that you are traversing an array.

Use the `[]` notation to denote array elements in the path when specifying which fields to keep.

This is necessary because JSON structures can include arrays, and you need to indicate that you are referring to elements within those arrays.

## Example Keep Field Configuration

See this example of a configuration to keep all fields except for `scheduledDepartureTime` under `origin` within `segments` of `originalSlice`::

```json
[
    ["response", "flightChanged"],
    ["response", "flightChangeReason"],
    ["response", "flownStatus"],

# Mock API Connections
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/mock-api



You can mock the API connections using Mock APIs.

GenerativeAgent supports Mocking API Connections to try out your raw API responses. Mock API Functions let you define request parameters (in JSON) without needing a live API.

The main benefits of mocking API connections are:

* Rapid prototyping of new Functions without a fully built API.
* Testing how GenerativeAgent processes or populates request parameters before real integration.
* Simplifying configuration for teams that want to get interacting with GenerativeAgent quickly before building or exposing internal APIs.

## Create a Mock API Function

Navigate to the “Functions” Page in the main GenerativeAgent menu and select “Functions.”

1. Click on “Create Function”

2. Choose “Integrate Later”
   * You will be prompted to select an existing API or “Integrate later.”
   * Select “Integrate later” to mark this Function as a Mock API and define the request parameters directly.
   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/IntegrateLater.png" />
   </Frame>

3. Name and Describe the new Function
   * **Function Name**: Give it a concise, unique name
   * **Function Purpose**: Briefly describe what the Mock Function is for
   <Tip>
     Example:

     * Name: “get\_flight\_details”
     * Purpose: “Retrieves flight information given a PNR”
   </Tip>

4. Define Request Parameters (JSON)
   * Under “Request parameters,” enter a valid JSON schema describing the parameters you want.
   * You can pick a template from the “Examples” dropdown or start with an empty JSON schema.
   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/MockAPIExample.png" />
   </Frame>
   * **Example Request**
   ```json
       {  
       "name": "name_of_function",  
       "description": "Brief description of what the Function is for",  
       "strict": true,  
       "parameters": {  
           "type": "object",  
           "required": ["account_number"],  
           "properties": {  
           "account_number": {  
               "type": "string",  
               "description": "The user’s account number."  
           },  
           "include_details": {  
               "type": "boolean",  
               "description": "Whether to include itemized details."  
           }  
           }  
       }  
       }  
   ```
   <Note>
     Make sure the JSON is valid.
     Invalid schemas are prevented from being saved.
   </Note>

5. Save Your Function

   * Click “Create Function” (or “Save”). If any part of your schema is invalid, an error will appear.
   * After saving, you remain on the function detail page, which shows the Function’s configuration and preview.

   <Note>
     You can configure additional fields and variables if you need prompts or placeholders in the conversation flow.

     For example: “Message before sending”, “Confirmation Message”, “Reference Variables”
   </Note>

### Best Practices

Here are some recommendations to help you make the best use of the Mock API feature:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep it Simple">
    Start with the core parameters. Add more detail as your needs become clearer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Meaningful Descriptions">
    Parameter descriptions helps GenerativeAgent understand what the parameters are and how to determine their values.
    They also help future users to remember each parameter purpose.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prototype First, Integrate Later">
    Begin testing your Function with a Mock schema, then transition smoothly to a real API when ready.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connect to a real API

When you are ready to connect the Function to an existing API in the Console:

1. Click on “Replace” on the Function detail page.
2. Select an existing API connection or create a new one.
3. Once replaced, the Function will call the real API during interactions instead of the Mock schema.

### Use Test Users

You can make use of [Test Users](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/test-users) to Mock the API return Scenarios in the Previewer


# Reference Variables
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/reference-variables

Learn how to use reference variables to store and reuse data from function responses

Reference variables let you store and reuse specific data returned from a function response.

Reference variables offer a powerful way to condition your GenerativeAgent tasks and functions on real data returned by your APIs—all without requiring code edits.

By properly naming, key-pathing, and optionally transforming your variables, you can build flexible, dynamic flows that truly adapt to each user's situation.

Once a reference variable is created, you can use it to:

* Conditionally make other Functions available
* Set conditional logic in prompt instructions
* Compare values across different parts of your GenerativeAgent workflow
* Control Function exposure based on data from previous function calls.
* Toggle conditional instructions in your Task s prompt depending on returned data
* Extract and transform values without hard‐coding logic into prompts or code

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/reference-variables.png" />
</Frame>

Reference variables can be configured in the GenerativeAgent Tooling Function edit page under the "Reference vars " option.

## Define a Reference Variable

To create a reference variable in the GenerativeAgent UI:

1. Navigate to the Function's settings
2. Find the "Reference vars (Optional)" section and click "Add"
3. Configure the following fields:

* **Name**
* **Response Keypath**
* **Transform Expression** (Optional)

### Name

This is the identifier you'll use to reference this variable in Jinja expressions.

```jinja
vars.get("variable_name")
```

### Response Keypath

This is the JSON path where the data will be extracted from, using dot notation.

```json
// For a response like:
{
  "available_rooms": [...]
}
// Use keypath:
response.available_rooms
```

### Transform Expression (Optional)

This is a Jinja expression to transform the extracted value. Common patterns include:

```jinja
# Check for specific string value
val == "COMPLIANT"

    # Check boolean values
    val == true or val == false

# Check for non-empty arrays/strings
val is not none and val|length > 0
```

Once saved, GenerativeAgent will automatically update these variables whenever the Function executes successfully and returns data matching the specified keypath.

<Note>
  Reference variable names are not unique across the entire system.

  If more than one Function defines a reference variable with the same name, whichever Function is called last may overwrite a variable's value.

  Reference variables are also used at runtime, meaning GenerativeAgent extracts the specified response data from each API call that returns successfully and updates the variable accordingly.
</Note>

## Example Condition

The following example calls a Condition on a `CheckRoomAvailability` Function.

1. Suppose a Reference Variable named `rooms_available` and defined with:
   * Response Keypath: `response.available_rooms `
   * Transform: `val is not none and val|length > 0 `
2. The `rooms_available` variable will be True whenever the returned list has a length greater than zero. You can then write:
3. In a Function's conditions (to make a function available for use, conditioned on the reference variable):
   ```json
       conditions: vars.get("rooms_available")
   ```
4. In Task instructions using Jinja:
   ```jinja
           {%- if vars.get("rooms_available") %}
           The requested rooms are available.  
           {%- else %}
           No rooms are currently available.  
           {%- endif %}
   ```

### Tips and Best Practice

Here are some tips to enhance your experience with  Reference Variables:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prefix Variables">
    Consider prefixing variable names to avoid clashes if multiple teams define references.

    Example: `user_is_compliant` vs. `is_compliant`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Short-circuit logic">
    Use short-circuit logic in transforms to avoid "NoneType cannot have length" errors

    Example `val is not none and val|length > 0`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Functions consideration">
    Keep in mind that if multiple Functions define the same reference variable name, one may overwrite the other depending on the call order.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


# Set Variable Functions
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/set-variable

Save a value from the conversation with a Set Variable Function.

You can store information determined during the conversation for reference in future steps using Set Variable Functions. This is useful for:

* Storing key information (like account numbers, ages, cancellation types) so GenerativeAgent doesn't have to re-prompt the user later.
* Returning or conditioning logic on data that GenerativeAgent has inferred.
* Manipulating or filtering data from APIs (e.g., extracting the single charge the customer disputes).

GenerativeAgent "sets" these variables in conversation, so they can be used immediately or in subsequent steps. You specify how the variable gets set based on the input parameters or existing variables.

To create a set variable function:

1. [Create a function](#step-1-create-a-function).
2. [Define the input parameters](#step-2-define-input-parameters-json).
3. [Specify the variables to set](#step-3-specify-set-variables).
4. [Save the function](#step-4-save-your-function).
5. [Use the function in a task](#step-5-use-the-function-in-the-conversation).

## Step 1: Create a Function

Navigate to the Functions page and click "Create Function."

1. Select "Set variable" and click "Next: Function details"
   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/SetVariableFunction.png" />
   </Frame>
2. Specify the Name and Purpose of the Function
   * **Function Name**: Provide a concise, unique name, using underscores (e.g., `get_lap_child_policy`).
   * **Function Purpose**: Briefly describe what the function does (e.g., "Determines whether a child can fly as a lap child").
     * GenerativeAgent uses this description to decide if and when it should invoke the function.

## Step 2: Define Input Parameters (JSON)

The input parameters are the values that GenerativeAgent needs to pass when calling this function.

You can leave the input parameters empty if you won't need new values from the conversation.

<Note>
  As with any function call, GenerativeAgent will gather the necessary information (from user messages or prior context) before calling the function.
</Note>

Under "Input Parameters," enter a valid JSON schema describing the parameters GenerativeAgent needs to pass when calling this function.

Mark a field as "required" if GenerativeAgent must obtain these values from the conversation.

```json Example Input Schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "account_number",
    "first_name",
    "last_name"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "account_number": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Customer's account number"
    },
    "first_name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Customer's first name"
    },
    "last_name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Customer's last name"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Specify "Set Variables"

At least one variable must be configured so GenerativeAgent can store the outcome of your function call. For each reference variable:

* Provide a Variable Name (e.g., `lap_child_policy`).
* Optionally, include [Jinja2](#jinja2-templating) transformations to manipulate or combine inputs or existing reference variables.
* Toggle "Include return variable as part of function response" to make the new variable immediately available to GenerativeAgent after the function call.

### Jinja2 Templates

Use [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) to create or modify the stored value.

As an Example, the following Jinja2 template will set the variable to **"Children under 2 can fly as a lap child."** if the `child_age_at_time_of_flight` is less than 2. Otherwise, it will set the variable to **"Children 2 or older must have their own seat."**

```jinja2
'Children under 2 can fly as a lap child.' if params.child_age_at_time_of_flight < 2 else 'Children 2 or older must have their own seat.''
```

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/SetVariableDefinition.png" />
</Frame>

## Step 4: Save Your Function

With your function defined, you can save it by clicking "Create Function".

After saving, you'll see a detail page showing the JSON schema and the configured reference variables.

## Step 5: Use the Function in the Conversation

Once you have created your set variable function, you must add the function to the task's list of available functions in order for GenerativeAgent to use it.

GenerativeAgent may call the function proactively, but we recommend you instruct GenerativeAgent to call the function explicitly.

Always make sure to test your functions with Previewer to ensure they work as expected.

Here's how the function works within a task and conversation flow:

1. GenerativeAgent collects the required parameters from the user (or context).
2. (Optional) A "Message before Sending" can be displayed to the user, clarifying why GenerativeAgent is saving data.
3. Jinja2 transformations convert or combine inputs, if defined.
4. Reference variables are created as soon as the function runs successfully—GenerativeAgent can immediately incorporate them into logic or other function calls.
5. If you turned on "Include return variable as part of function response," GenerativeAgent receives the new values right away, shaping subsequent interaction steps.

<Accordion title="Example task leveraging reference variables set by a set variable function">
  ```jinja2
  # Objective
  Assist the customer in adding a lap child to their flight reservation by determining eligibility and communicating relevant policies.

  # Context
  - The customer has provided their confirmation number.
  - No lap children currently exist on their reservation.

  # Instructions
  1. **Eligibility Check:**
     - Call the `get_lap_child_policy` function to determine if the child is eligible as a lap child and obtain the policy.

  2. **Communicate Eligibility and Policy:**

     - {% if vars.get("child_eligible_as_lap_child") == true %}
         - Inform the customer: "The child is eligible as a lap child and will be {{ vars.get('childs_age') }} at the time of the flight. Lap child policy: {{ vars.get('lap_child_policy') }}."
     - {% elif vars.get("child_eligible_as_lap_child") == false %}
         - Inform the customer: "The child is not eligible as a lap child because they will be {{ vars.get('childs_age') }} at the time of the flight. Lap child policy: {{ vars.get('lap_child_policy') }}."
     - {% endif %}

  3. **Customer Action Based on Eligibility:**

     - {% if vars.get("child_eligible_as_lap_child") == true %}
         - Ask if the customer would like to add their child as a lap child.
         - If yes, call the `add_lap_child()` function.
     - {% elif vars.get("child_eligible_as_lap_child") == false %}
         - Offer assistance in purchasing a seat for the child.
         - Based on customer response:
           - Assist in seat purchase if desired.
           - If not, ask if further assistance is needed.
     - {% endif %}

  ```
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

Here are some recommendations to help you make the best use of the set variables function type:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Meaningful Names and Descriptions">
    Label your variables and functions clearly (e.g., "child\_age\_at\_time\_of\_flight") so GenerativeAgent and your team understand their purpose.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Allow Variables to Be Returned By Default">
    By toggling "Include return variable as part of function response," GenerativeAgent can incorporate newly stored data immediately. Even if this is off, the variable is still saved for future reference.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Jinja2 Logic">
    Apply conditionals and expressions to reduce guesswork—for instance, deciding if a child is under 2 for lap-child eligibility.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage Conditions">
    In a Task's configuration, specify "Conditions" to control when GenerativeAgent should call this function. This helps you keep flows tidy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Schemas Focused">
    Avoid clutter or extraneous parameters. A clear schema helps GenerativeAgent gather exactly what's needed without prompting extra questions.

# System Transfer Functions
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/system-transfer

Signal conversation control transfer to external systems with System Transfer Functions.

System Transfer Functions signal that control of the conversation should be transferred from GenerativeAgent to an external system. They can also return reference variables (e.g., a determined "intent," or details about a charge) for further processing outside of GenerativeAgent.

By using a System Transfer Function, you can:

* End the conversation gracefully, indicating that GenerativeAgent is finished.
* Hand control back to the calling application or IVR once a goal is met.
* Send relevant conversation data (e.g., identified charges, subscription flags, or determined intent) for follow-up workflows.

To create a system transfer function:

1. [Create a function](#step-1-create-a-new-function)
2. [Define input parameters](#step-2-define-input-parameters-json)
3. [Set variables (optional)](#step-3-optional-set-variables)
4. [Save the function](#step-4-save-your-function)
5. [Use the function in a task](#step-6-using-the-system-transfer-function-in-the-conversation)
6. [Handle the system transfer event](#step-5-handle-the-system-transfer-event)

## Step 1: Create a New Function

Navigate to the Functions page and click "Create Function."

1. Select "System transfer" and click "Next: Function details"
   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/SetSystemTransferFunction.png" />
   </Frame>
2. Specify the Name and Purpose of the Function
   * **Function Name**: Provide a concise, unique name, using underscores (e.g., `issue_refund_request`).
   * **Function Purpose**: Briefly describe what the function does (e.g., "Takes the collected charge info and indicates a refund request should be processed").
     * GenerativeAgent uses this description to determine if/when it should call the function.

## Step 2: Define Input Parameters (JSON)

The input parameters are the values that GenerativeAgent needs to pass when calling this function to transfer control to the external system.

Under "Input Parameters," enter a valid JSON schema describing the required parameters. GenerativeAgent will gather the necessary information (from user messages or prior context) before calling the function.

```json Example Input Schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "line_item_number",
    "is_eligible_for_refund",
    "is_subscription"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "line_item_number": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The line item number associated with the charge"
    },
    "is_eligible_for_refund": {
      "type": "boolean", 
      "description": "Whether or not the line item is eligible for a refund"
    },
    "is_subscription": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "Whether or not the charge is associated with a subscription"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: (Optional) Set Variables

Though System Transfer Functions typically return control to an external system, you can still configure one or more reference variables:

* Configure variables to rename or transform parameter values for the external system
* Use [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) for transformations if needed
* Toggle "Include return variable as part of function response" to make variables immediately available

### Jinja2 Templates

Use Jinja2 to transform values before transfer. For example, to convert a string boolean to a proper boolean:

```jinja2
true if params.get("is_subscription") == "True" else false
```

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/SystemTransferFunction.png" />
</Frame>

## Step 4: Save Your Function

With your function defined, save it by clicking "Create Function".

After saving, you'll see a detail page showing the JSON schema and any configured reference variables.

## Step 5: Using the System Transfer Function in the Conversation

Once you have created your system transfer function, you must add the function to the task's list of available functions for GenerativeAgent to use it.

GenerativeAgent may call the function proactively, but we recommend you instruct GenerativeAgent to call the function explicitly.

Always make sure to test your functions with Previewer to ensure they work as expected.

Here's how the function works within a task and conversation flow:

1. GenerativeAgent collects the required parameters from the user (or context).
2. (Optional) A "Message before Sending" can be displayed to the user, clarifying why GenerativeAgent is transferring control.
3. Jinja2 transformations convert or combine inputs, if defined.
4. GenerativeAgent calls the System Transfer Function, signaling that control returns to the external system.
   * All reference variables collected during the conversation are passed along.
   * If configured, the function's specific variables also appear in the final response.

<Accordion title="Example scenario using a System Transfer Function">
  ```jinja
  # Objective
  Identify the line item for an unrecognized charge, verify refund eligibility, and transfer control to the external system once the user confirms a refund request.

  # Context
  - We already have a list of recent transactions.
  - The user has confirmed which charge is disputed.

  # Instructions
  1. **Identify the Charge:**
     - Gather details: date, amount, and merchant to confirm the correct line item.
     - Store "line_item_number" once identified.

  2. **Check Refund Eligibility:**
     - If the line item meets the refund criteria, set "is_eligible_for_refund" to true.
     - If part of a subscription, set "is_subscription" to true for any special handling.

  3. **Offer Refund:**
     - {% if vars.get("is_eligible_for_refund") == true %}
       - Ask the customer: "Shall we proceed with the refund?"
       - If yes:
         - Call the `issue_refund_request` System Transfer Function.
     - {% else %}
       - Apologize, indicate no refund is possible. Offer further assistance.
     - {% endif %}
  ```

    Choose function names like "issue\_refund\_request" or "complete\_intent\_transfer." Provide concise descriptions so GenerativeAgent knows when to transfer control.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage Conditions">
    If you only want the system transfer to occur after specific statuses or variables are set, configure "Conditions" in the Task's function list so GenerativeAgent calls it at the correct time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stay Focused with Your Schema">
    Your function schema should cover only the data needed by the external system. Minimizing extra fields ensures smoother handoff.

    Handle naming or logic differences between GenerativeAgent and your external system with optional Jinja2 transformations (e.g., rename "is\_subscription" to "subscriptionFlag").
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 6: Handle the System Transfer Event

When the function is called in your task, the conversation will be transferred to your system. This transfer is communicated via the [generative agent events](/generativeagent/integrate/handling-events) that are sent as part of the conversation handling.

Each reference variable currently set are passed as `referenceVariables`, and any variables set in the function are passed as `transferVariables`.

```json Example System Transfer Event
{
  "generativeAgentMessageId": "bba4320f-de53-4874-83b4-6c8704d3620c",
  "externalConversationId": "33411121",
  "conversationId": "01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3",
  "type": "systemTransfer",
  "systemTransfer": {
    "referenceVariables": {
      "customerName": "John Smith",
      "accountNumber": "12345",
      "isActive": true
    },
    "transferVariables": {
      "line_item_number": "1234567890",
      "is_eligible_for_refund": true,
      "is_subscription": false
    },
    "currentTaskName": "handle_refund_requests"
  }
}

# Test Users
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/test-users



A Test User is a simulated user created to test scenarios with the GenerativeAgent [Previewer](/generativeagent/configuring/previewer).

These users help you mimic API interactions, allowing you to assess how tasks and functions behave in various conditions without requiring calls to real API endpoints.

By using Test Users, you can ensure that GenerativeAgent handles key workflows, edge cases, and potential issues effectively.

<Note>
  Test Users allow you to define replies for different API calling scenarios (e.g., the return for an API Call named getAddress but having different user IDs).
</Note>

Use Test Users to test:

* Key happy-flows
* Edge cases
* Common problems or issues

### Create a Test User

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/TestUserCreate.png" />
</Frame>

To create a Test User:

1. Navigate to the Test User page in GenerativeAgent and click "Create User".
2. Provide the following information:
   * Name of the test user
   * Purpose of the test user (optional) to describe what situations this test user should be used (e.g. `Tests layovers greater than 4 hours`).
3. You can choose to manually mock data or to auto-generate mock data by describing a test scenario.
   * To auto-generate, enable the scenario toggle and describe the scenario for the test user.
   <Note>
     Auto-generating a test user may take up to one minute to complete. You can close the scenario dialog while the test user is being generated.
   </Note>

### Configure and Modify Test User Data

After creating a Test User, ensure that your mock data aligns with your testing needs.

* Auto-Generated Data: Review the generated functions and mock data. If needed, click the "Regenerate" button to update the mocked data based on a revised scenario.
* Manually Created Data: Add functions and manually mock data by using the "+ Add function" button. Ensure that each function accurately reflects the scenario you want to test.

<Note>
  For each function, provide the mocked request and response in JSON.
</Note>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/TestUserMockedData.png" />
</Frame>

#### Add Variants to Mocked Data

Adding variants allows for different responses to be returned for different request parameters within the same function. For example, you may want different data returned for different confirmation codes, like below.

To add an additional variant to a function:

1. Click "+ Add variants" at the bottom of the function.
2. Define new request parameters and corresponding response data.
3. Save to include the variant in your test user setup.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/TestUserMockedDataVariants.png" />
</Frame>

## Use Test Users in the Previewer

Once you have saved your test user, you are now ready to simulate a conversation with GenerativeAgent in the [Previewer](/generativeagent/configuring/previewer).


# Trial Mode
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/trial-mode



Trial mode allows admins to safely deploy new GenerativeAgent use cases to production.

A function can be marked as being in trial mode, so that when GenerativeAgent calls that function, it instead will escalate to a human agent.

This can allow you to:

* Ensure GenerativeAgent called the function properly given the conversation context.
* Ensure GenerativeAgent interpreted the function response and responded to the customer correctly.
* Be protected from unknown API response variations that you might not have accounted for during development and testing.

After running a function in trial mode and confirming it responds as expected, you can disable trial mode, deploying the function into full production use.

<Note>
  Trial mode is [distinct from A/B testing](#trial-mode-vs-a-b-testing). Trial mode is intended to ensure a function works correctly, not comparing outcomes between two functions or version.
</Note>

## Using Trial Mode

Enable trial mode on functions when you want to observe how GenerativeAgent would use that function in production by forcing escalation to a live agent immediately before or after the function is called.

<Warning>
  Enabling trial mode will temporarily reduce your containment rates because conversations are configured to escalate to a live agent instead of being fully handled by GenerativeAgent.

  However, this temporary reduction in containment is a trade-off for the added safety and reliability gained from observing and validating GenerativeAgent's behavior in a controlled environment before full deployment.
</Warning>

For example, suppose a new use case allows GenerativeAgent to check a customer's refund eligibility and then issue a refund if eligible. An admin may want to gate this new task based on two functions:

* Checking the refund eligibility; and then
* Issuing the refund.

### Example Two phase trial mode

An admin may decide to configure trial mode in two phases for this use case.

**Phase 1**

An admin can configure GenerativeAgent to call the first function (checking the refund eligibility), but then immediately escalate to a live agent to continue resolving the customer's issue. This would allow admins to observe how GenerativeAgent calls the refund eligibility function and how it would have interpreted and communicated the response of the function back to the customer.

**Phase 2**

For the second function (issuing the refund), an admin may configure that GenerativeAgent should escalate to a live agent before the function is called, as this type of function actually performs an action in a backend system. Configuring trial mode to escalate before the function is called allows admins to observe how GenerativeAgent would have called the function.

In both scenarios, trial mode lets admins observe how GenerativeAgent would have performed on production data before actually letting GenerativeAgent use the function responses to interact with the customer.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/trial-mode-2-phase.png" />
</Frame>

### Deciding to deploy a function

You can turn off trial mode and fully deploy the function when you have gathered sufficient data and confidence that GenerativeAgent is correctly calling the function and interpreting its responses.

This can be determined by monitoring the escalations, reviewing how GenerativeAgent would have handled the interactions, and ensuring that there are no significant issues or undesired behaviors.

## Toggle Trial Mode

By default, trial mode is toggled off.

When you want to enable trial mode for a function, click the toggle.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-738fefcd-4a0f-936d-6456-12a389aac78e.png" />
</Frame>

When using trial mode, you need to specify:

* **Escalation behavior:**
  * **Before Calling**: GenerativeAgent will escalate to a live agent before calling the function. This allows you to see what GenerativeAgent would have called the function.
  * **After Calling**: GenerativeAgent will call the function, but then escalate to an agent before responding to the customer.
* Message to send to customer: The message that will be sent to customer before escalation. Can be left blank to not send a dedicated message.

## Evaluate behavior in Previewer

When trail mode is activated, you can see the trial behavior in previewer.

### Escalate Before Call

When trial mode is toggled on and configured to escalate before the function is called, you can see the example function request GenerativeAgent would have made before the "Transferred to agent" event.

<Frame>
  <img height="300" alt="Trial mode before calling" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-f219b86a-9930-9735-7885-9916c3e7dd8c.png" />
</Frame>

### Escalate After Call

When trial mode is toggled on and configured to escalate after the function is called, GenerativeAgent will call the function, and then escalate to an agent.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-a644be6b-8ae0-822a-fc90-239f04d985b5.png" />
</Frame>

## Trial Mode vs A/B Testing

A/B tests and trial mode are two complementary functionalities that both enable safe deployment.

A/B tests are configured at the GenerativeAgent level, where a customer is either seeing the GenerativeAgent treatment or the control treatment (where the control treatment might be the treatment customers saw prior to GenerativeAgent).

Trial mode can be configured within an A/B test. For example, it could be that 10% of the traffic in an A/B test is seeing GenerativeAgent, and within that 10% trial mode is on for one or more functions.


# Getting Started
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/getting-started



An integration into GenerativeAgent requires a combination of configuring the bot as well as the technical integrations that hook your system into GenerativeAgent. These are represented by these core steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your tasks">
    These are a series of tasks you want GenerativeAgent to handle.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share your Knowledge Base">
    This allows GenerativeAgent to respond with accuracy and using your already established information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your APIs">
    Expose the APIs that GenerativeAgent will use as needed by the tasks you've defined. This unlocks the full potential of GenerativeAgent to perform the same tasks your agents are able perform, such as booking airline tickets, looking up bill discrepancies, or getting a customer's information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate your Voice or Chat System">
    Use Connectors or integrate directly in our API to enable GenerativeAgent to talk to end users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  At all points during your relationship with ASAPP, you have access to the previewer. The Previewer gives you live access to GenerativeAgent and allows for rapidly testing changes you may want to make.
</Note>

## Step 1: Define your Tasks

You need to define the **Tasks** you want the GenerativeAgent to perform. Tasks are the root of the actions that GenerativeAgent performs.

For each task, you specify the **Functions** you want it to use. Functions are what allow your GenerativeAgent to perform all the same actions a live Agent can perform.

GenerativeAgent only operates within the tasks and functions that you define. Allowing you to control the scope you want GenerativeAgent to handle.

The scope of the tasks will determine the Knowledge Bases and APIs it may need access to. They should be determined before you implement the rest of the integration.

<Card title="Configuring GenerativeAgent" href="/generativeagent/configuring">Learn more about defining Tasks and Functions.</Card>

## Step 2: Share your Knowledge Base

Connecting your knowledge base is critical as it ensures that GenerativeAgent only speaks with accuracy about your company and policies.

There are several ways you can connect GenerativeAgent to your knowledge base to GenerativeAgent:

<Card title="Connecting your knowledge base" href="/generativeagent/configuring/connecting-your-knowledge-base">Learn more about how to pass your knowledge base to GenerativeAgent.</Card>

## Step 3: Connect your APIs

GenerativeAgent calls your APIs to retrieve data as well as to perform actions such as booking a flight or canceling an order.

ASAPP supports REST and GraphQL APIs. To Connect your APIs, you need to provide an OpenAPI spec of the API you want to use and configure access information, such as authentication method.

ASAPP also allows for in-depth user mocking to make it easier to iterate on GenerativeAgent's performance with the Previewer.

<Card title="Connecting your APIs" href="/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis">Learn how GenerativeAgent can use your APIs.</Card>

## Step 4: Integrate into your Voice or Chat System

You need to hook GenerativeAgent into your support channels. This is both sending conversation data to ASAPP and passing the response from GenerativeAgent to your end user.

This includes listening to a stream of events from GenerativeAgent, as well as hooking up your voice or text channels into ASAPP.

We support several Connectors to streamline much of the integration, but also allow for direct, text-based communication.

<Card title="Integrating GenerativeAgent" href="/generativeagent/integrate">Learn how to connect your contact center into GenerativeAgent</Card>

## Next Steps

After a first conversation with GenerativeAgent, you'll be able to resolve customer inquiries by making continuous calls to the Agent!

Here a few other topics that may help you:

# Go Live
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/go-live



After configuring GenerativeAgent and connecting to ASAPP's servers, you can go live into your production environments.

These are the steps to take to go live:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Pre-check" />

  <Step title="Validate Your Integration" />

  <Step title="Launch GenerativeAgent into Production" />

  <Step title="Post Launch Maintenance" />
</Steps>

## Step 1: Validate your Configuration

Review that the following sections of the Configuration Phase are working as expected or have been signed off:

* **Functional requirements**: Confirm your Tasks and Function Requirements were addressed by your ASAPP Team and are correctly set up in GenerativeAgent. You can use the Previewer to test task and functions.

* **Functional and UAT Testing**: Validate individual components and end-to-end functionality between the GenerativeAgent and your customers. Your organization and your ASAPP Team must have signed off acceptance for the functionality of tasks, requirements, and user interactions before going live.

* **Human-In-the-Loop Set-up**: Confirm the Human-In-the-Loop definitions are properly defined in the GenerativeAgent's Tasks

  You can use the Previewer to test Human-in-the-Loop.

* **Credentials Verification**: Verify all your ASAPP Credentials and API Keys are obtained and that all key connections and calls to GenerativeAgent return data without any issue.

* **API Connections**: Ensure your APIs are connected to GenerativeAgent and your applications are calling GenerativeAgent and ASAPP to send messages and analyze them

* **Knowledge Base ingestion**: Ensure the Tasks and Functions you previously defined align with the responses that reference your Knowledge Base as Source-of-Truth.

## Step 2: Validate your Integration

Separated from GenerativeAgent functional configuration, you need to ensure your voice or chat applications are fully integrated with Generative Agent to go live.

<Note>
  Your method of integration determines the steps to go live
</Note>

To validate your integration is working smoothly, remember the following:

**Event Handling**

Ensure you are handling all events. GenerativeAgent communicates back to you via events.

These events are sent via Server-Sent-Event stream.

**API Integration**

Test your APIs exposure in the GenerativeAgent UI: Test how GenerativeAgent calls your APIs when performing Functions

You can do this in the previewer.

**Audio Integration**

Audio Integrations need a consistent flow of incoming and outcoming audio streams. Ensure that your organization opens, stops, and ends audio streams in every interaction between a customer and an agent.

**AutoTranscribe Websocket Integration**

* **Real-time Messaging**: Ensure that the URL Websocket connections are continuously provided by the ASAPP Server.

* **WebSocket protocol**: Request messages in the sequence must be formatted as text (UTF-8 encoded string data); only the audio stream should be formatted in binary. All response messages must also be formatted as text.

**Third Party Connectors**

Follow the integration procedure for the Third Party Connectors of your choice:

<Card title="UniMRCP Pluggin" href="/generativeagent/integrate/unimrcp-plugin-for-asapp" />

After the integration, ensure that your Third Party Connector is receiving and sending audio streams to the ASAPP Servers. This is done outside of the ASAPP applications.

**Text-only Integration**

Text conversations with GenerativeAgent can be ensured via the Previewer. Ensure messages are sent, analyzed, and that the GenerativeAgent replies with expected outputs

### Substep: Test the Integration

Test your integration to ensure that GenerativeAgent

> **Performance Testing**: Simulate expected traffic or high-traffic scenarios to determine any breaking-point or requirements meeting.

## Step 3: Launch GenerativeAgent to Production

Now you are ready to deploy GenerativeAgent into your Production environments.

### Deploy GenerativeAgent

Deploy GenerativeAgent into your Production environments without further effort.

You can do this from the GenerativeAgent UI.

<Card title="Deploy Generative Agent" href="/generativeagent/configuring/deploying-to-generativeagent" />

### Talk with GenerativeAgent

Now that GenerativeAgent is live in your Organization's environments, you can talk to the GenerativeAgent and receive LLM support.

> If your Integration has a Voice Channel, call your internal phone numbers and ask for issues or inquiries your customers would ask.
>
> If your integration with GenerativeAgent has a (message) Chat Integration, use the GenerativeAgent UI to continuously review how the GenerativeAgent helps with customer support and other issues.
>
> If your Integration involves Voice applications, you can also gather insights from GenerativeAgent's analyze calls in the GenerativeAgent UI.

## Step 4: Post Launch Maintenance

There are still some things you can do after GenerativeAgent is deployed.

Here are some things that your organization can do to continuously monitor GenerativeAgent while it is live.

Your ASAPP team is at your disposal to check anything else!

**Performance Monitoring**

* **Analytics**: Continuously analyze user interactions and system logs to make the better of analytics that can make GenerativeAgent perform better.
* **Alerts**: Use your internal monitoring tools to check on GenerativeAgent's Performance.
* **Enhancement**: ASAPP is continuously enhancing its AI products, so feel free to address your ASAPP Team for new features or improvements.

**Feedback**

Feedback Sessions: Your ASAPP team is always ready to receive feedback either from customer satisfaction surveys or from internal auditions.

**Internal Training**

Provide comprehensive training sessions for your internal staff in the scenarios where GenerativeAgent performs.

In the case that your Organization uses Human-in-the-Loop, train your staff for the scenarios when your human agents help GenerativeAgent in tasks.

**Support Plan**

Establish with your ASAPP team a support plan for post-launch assistance. This can work either by Helpdesk queries or direct support from your ASAPP Team.


# How GenerativeAgent Works
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/how-it-works

Discover how GenerativeAgent functions to resolve customer issues.

GenerativeAgent operates by:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyzing customer interactions in real-time" />

  <Step title="Accessing relevant information from your knowledge base" />

  <Step title="Interacting with back-end systems through APIs" />

  <Step title="Generating human-like responses to resolve issues" />
</Steps>

Unlike traditional bots with predefined flows, GenerativeAgent uses natural language processing to understand and respond to a wide range of customer queries and issues.

## How It Works

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/ga-how-it-works-detailed.png" alt="GenerativeAgent Integration Flow" />
</Frame>

GenerativeAgent seamlessly integrates with your existing customer support infrastructure, providing AI-powered assistance across voice and chat channels. Here's a simplified overview of how GenerativeAgent operates:

1. **Conversation Initiation**: When a customer starts an interaction, your system sends the conversation data to GenerativeAgent.

2. **GenerativeAgent Activation**: GenerativeAgent is initiated to handle the conversation, taking over the interaction with the customer.

3. **Information Processing**: GenerativeAgent analyzes the customer's input, considering the full context of the conversation.

4. **Task Identification and Execution**: Based on the configured tasks you've defined, GenerativeAgent:
   * Identifies relevant tasks to address the customer's needs
   * Accesses necessary information from your knowledge base
   * Interacts with your APIs to perform required actions

5. **Response Generation**: GenerativeAgent creates human-like responses to communicate with the customer, providing information or confirming actions taken.

6. **Continuous Interaction**: This process continues, with GenerativeAgent handling the back-and-forth with the customer until all issues are resolved.

7. **Escalation (if needed)**: If the customer has an issue that GenerativeAgent is not configured to handle, it will smoothly escalate the conversation to a human agent.

This flexible approach allows GenerativeAgent to handle a wide range of customer interactions efficiently, only involving human agents when necessary.

<Info>We provide a [technical flow chart](/generativeagent/integrate/) for how these steps apply to the technical integration</Info>

## Previewer Tool

To help you understand and fine-tune GenerativeAgent's performance, we provide a Previewer tool. This allows you to:

* Observe GenerativeAgent in action with simulated customer interactions
* See the logic and actions GenerativeAgent performs in real-time
* Gain insights into how GenerativeAgent makes decisions and uses your configured tasks, knowledge base, and APIs

<Callout type="info">
  The Previewer ensures that GenerativeAgent is not a black box. It allows both technical and non-technical team members to visualize and understand how GenerativeAgent handles customer interactions, helping you optimize its performance for your specific use cases.
</Callout>

By leveraging GenerativeAgent's advanced capabilities and the insights provided by the Previewer tool, you can create a powerful, transparent, and efficient AI-driven solution for your customer support needs.

# Human in the Loop
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/human-in-the-loop

Learn how GenerativeAgent works with human agents to handle complex cases requiring expert guidance or approval.

Human-in-the-loop is a first-of-its kind capability that allows a human agent to guide GenerativeAgent in assisting a customer. GenerativeAgent may request human help in situations where it lacks the necessary API access, knowledge sources, or requires human approval to complete an action.

GenerativeAgent raises a ticket requesting specific help through your existing digital support tool. Available agents within your organization are part of dedicated human-in-the-loop queues where they receive and respond to tickets from GenerativeAgent, thereby resolving the customer issue.

The Human-in-the-loop Agents (HILA) within your organization wait in a queue and are directed to specific scenarios where they take on the action of helping in a customer's issue and give back the conversation to the GenerativeAgent. HILAs can also transfer the conversation to a Live Agent so they take over the task from GenerativeAgent.

## When should GenerativeAgent consult a human

The Human-in-the-loop capability can be invoked in the task instructions for the GenerativeAgent. You can specify scenarios or actions that the GenerativeAgent cannot perform automatically and require human intervention for information or confirmation. This is similar to actions a human agent cannot complete without supervisor approval.

Recommended scenarios for human assistance include:

* Insufficient permissions: When the GenerativeAgent should not act out in its own without HILA approval.
* No API to call: Whenever there is no API to call to retrieve specific customer information.
* No Knowledge Base information: Whenever the question or issue provided by the costumer has no content in the Knowledge Base source that GenerativeAgent can use.

## HILAs

The primary function of the human-in-the-loop is to support and unblock the GenerativeAgent. These supervisors handle tasks requiring approvals or a deep understanding of the issues. Tier 1 agents can address simpler queries. When accepting a ticket from the GenerativeAgent in your digital support tool, agents access an embedded Human-in-the-loop UI.

The actions HILAs are set to do include:

* Ticket assignments
* Response edits/decisions
* Unlock GenerativeAgent
* Escalation to live agents

Human-in-the-loop agents assist the GenerativeAgent without directly interacting with customers, differing from live agents.

The key benefit is that a single agent can manage multiple customer conversations simultaneously without engaging in calls or chats.

If the Human-in-the-loop agent determines that a live agent would better serve the customer, they can use the Transfer option in the UI to hand off the conversation from the GenerativeAgent to a live agent.

**When does GenerativeAgent transfer to a live agent?**

The following scenarios are recommended for transferring a conversation to a live agent:

* A human-in-the-loop instructs GenerativeAgent to do so
* There are no Human-in-the-loop agents available. This is managed automatically and does not require explicit instructions.
* The customer explicitly requests it (if configured).

## Agent UI

**Enabling human-in-the-loop capability**

Human-in-the-loop agents operate from the existing Agent Desk. To enable the Human-in-the-loop UI and task functions in GenerativeAgent, please contact your Implementation Manager.

The Human-in-the-loop agent UI is the primary application where agents can interact with the GenerativeAgent. Through this interface, they can:

* Respond to the GenerativeAgent
* Transfer conversations to live agents
* View the interaction thread history
* Access relevant customer information and summarized conversation context

This section provides an overview of important features available:

* **Transfer**: Allows the agent to transfer the conversation from the GenerativeAgent to a live agent.
* **Ticket Assignment Timer**: Tracks the time elapsed since the ticket was assigned to the agent.
* **Prompt**: Indicates the specific assistance the GenerativeAgent needs to unblock the customer. This is generated by the GenerativeAgent itself.
* **Response**: The Human-in-the-loop agent can respond to the GenerativeAgent through an open text field or structured options, depending on the configuration.
* **Send**: After selecting a response, the agent can click 'Send' to submit the response and close the ticket simultaneously.
* **Context**: Provides a summarized context of the conversation between the GenerativeAgent and the customer.
* **Transcript**: Displays the complete customer interaction thread prior to the ticket being raised.
* **Customer**: Shows the customer's details, including company and specific account information for authenticated customers.

# Integrate GenerativeAgent Overview
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/integrate



Integrating into GenerativeAgent requires you to hook GenerativeAgent into your voice or chat system. This enabled GenerativeAgent to talk to your users.

An end-to-end integration of GenerativeAgent can be represented by these key components:

* **Connecting your data sources and APIs**.
  * Feed your [knowledge base into ASAPP](/generativeagent/configuring/connecting-your-knowledge-base), and [connect your APIs](/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis). GenerativeAgent will use them to help users and perform actions.
* **Listening and Handling GenerativeAgents**. Create a single SSE stream where events from all conversations are sent.
  * Events are how GenerativeAgent's response is sent, as well as other key status information.
* **Send your audio or text conversation data** to ASAPP and have GenerativeAgent **analyze the conversation**.

Passing the conversation data, analyzing with GenerativeAgent, then handling events functions as a loop until the conversation completes or the conversation needs to be escalated to an agent.

The below diagram shows how these components work together, and the general order in which they execute during a conversation:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/integrate-overview.png" />
</Frame>

1. Create an SSE stream and handle the GenerativeAgents events sent via the stream. GenerativeAgent's reply is sent via this event stream. You need to provide the bot's response back to your user.
2. Send your audio to AutoTranscribe. Use one of our Connectors to streamline this integration. Otherwise, you can use our websocket integration to pass raw audio.
3. Pass the conversation transcript into ASAPP. This is the transcript you receive from AutoTranscribe or the direct text of a conversation if a chat channel like SMS.
4. Engage GenerativeAgent on the conversation with the /analyze call. GenerativeAgent will look into ASAPP's conversation data to account for the entire conversation context.

<Note>
  You need to [configure GenerativeAgent](/generativeagent/configuring) in order for it to connect to your Knowledge Base and APIs.
</Note>

## Connectors

Integrate GenerativeAgent into Amazon Connect

The Amazon Connect integration with ASAPP's GenerativeAgent allows a caller into your Amazon Connect contact center to have a conversation with Generative Agent.

This guide demonstrates an example integration using AWS's basic building blocks and ASAPP-provided flows. It showcases how the various components work together, but you can adapt or replace any part of the integration to match your organization's requirements.

## How it works

At a high level, the Amazon Connect integration with GenerativeAgent works by handing off the conversation between your Amazon Connect flow and GenerativeAgent:

1. **Hand off the conversation** to GenerativeAgent through your Amazon Connect Flows.
2. **GenerativeAgent handles the conversation** using Lambda functions to communicate with ASAPP's APIs, and respond to the caller using AWS's Text to Speech (TTS) service.
3. **Return control back** to your Amazon Connect Flow when:
   * The conversation is successfully completed
   * The caller requests a human agent
   * An error occurs

<Accordion title="Detailed Flow">
  Here's how a GenerativeAgent call will work in detail within your Amazon Connect:

  1. Your Amazon Connect Flow receives an incoming call
  2. When the flow engages GenerativeAgent, the Flow:
     * Sets required contact attributes
     * Starts media streaming
     * Calls ASAPP's API to initiate the conversation
  3. During the conversation:
     * Live audio streams through Kinesis Video Streams
     * Lambda functions coordinate between Amazon Connect and GenerativeAgent including using AWS's Text to Speech (TTS) service to respond to the caller.
     * Redis manages the conversation state
  4. When the conversation ends, GenerativeAgent returns control to your Flow with:
     * The conversation outcome
     * Any error messages
     * Instructions for next steps (e.g., transfer to agent)

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/AmazonConnectDiagram.png" />
  </Frame>

  <Note>
    You are free to choose the moment when GenerativeAgent is invoked by Amazon Connect in your Contact Flow.

    You can add GenerativeAgent to any or all of your Amazon Contact Phone Numbers.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

## Before you Begin

Before using the GenerativeAgent integration with Amazon Connect, you need to:

* [Get your API Key Id and Secret](/getting-started/developers#access-api-credentials)
  * Ensure your API key has been configured to access GenerativeAgent APIs. Reach out to your ASAPP team if you need access enabled.
* Have an existing Amazon Connect Instance
  * Have claimed phone numbers.
  * Access to an Amazon Connect admin account.
* AWS administrator account with the permissions for the following:
  * Creating/managing IAM roles/policies: create a policy permitting list/read operations on the Kinesis Video Streams associated with the Amazon Connect Flow
  * Managing Amazon Connect Instance
  * Create/manage Lambda functions
  * Create/manage CloudWatch Log Groups
  * Create/manage ElastiCache for Redis
  * Create/manage VPC
* Be familiar with AWS including Amazon Connect, IAM roles, and more:

  <Accordion title="AWS Components">
    You will set up and configure the following AWS services:

    * **Amazon Connect** - Handles call flow and audio streaming
    * **Redis ElastiCache** - Manages conversation state and actions
    * **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** - Provides network isolation
    * **Kinesis Video Streams** - Handles real-time audio streaming
    * **IAM Roles and Permissions** - Controls access between services
    * **Lambda Functions** - These functions will handle communication between Amazon Connect and GenerativeAgent
  </Accordion>
* Receive the Generative Agent Connect Flow and Prompts from your ASAPP team.

The components used in the example integration are **intended for testing environments**, and you can use your own components in Production when you integrate GenerativeAgent.

## Step 1: Set up your AWS Account and Amazon Connect Instance

You need to set up your AWS Account and configure AWS services that will be used for an Amazon Connect flow that engages GenerativeAgent. You will configure the flow in a future step.

### Provide a dedicated VPC

All components of the GenerativeAgent Amazon Connect integration expect to be in the same VPC.

Ensure you have a VPC with at least two subnets in different Availability Zones

<Tip>
  You can use an existing VPC or create a new one.
</Tip>

### Configure your Amazon Connect Instance

You need to connect your Amazon Connect Instance with an Amazon Kinesis Video Stream Service in your AWS account.

To configure the Amazon Connect Instance, you need to:

* Navigate to Connect -> Data storage -> Live Media Storage
* Enable Live Media Streaming under Data Storage options.
* Set a retention period at minimum of 1 hour.
* Save the **kinesis video stream instance prefix**, it will be used as part of setting up the [permissions for the IAM role](#step-3-configure-iam-roles-and-policies).

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/LiveMediaStreaming.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  The access to the Kinesis Video Streams service is [controlled by IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/how-iam).

  GenerativeAgent uses an IAM role in the ASAPP account to access the Kinesis Video Streams service.
</Note>

### Create security groups

Create security groups that you will use for communication between the Lambda functions and the ElastiCache Cluster:

* Security group for the ElastiCache Cluster
* Security group for the PullAction Lambda
* Security group for the PushAction Lambda

You will use these security groups when setting up the [Lambda Functions](#step-2-create-lambda-functions-to-call-generativeagent).

Once created, you will need to configure the security groups:

* **PullAction Lambda Security Group**
  * Outbound
    * Allow TCP traffic on port 6379 to the just created  ElastiCache cluster security group
  * Save the security group id, it will be used when creating the [PullAction Lambda](#pullaction).
* **PushAction Lambda Security Group**
  * Outbound
    * Allow TCP traffic on port 6379 to the just created  ElastiCache cluster security group
  * Save the security group id, it will be used when creating the [PushAction Lambda](#pushaction).
* **ElastiCache Security Group**
  * Inbound
    * Allow TCP traffic on port 6379 from the just created PullAction lambda security group
    * Allow TCP traffic on port 6379 from the just created PushAction lambda security group
  * Save the security group id, it will be used when creating the [Redis ElastiCache Cluster](#redis-ElastiCache-cluster).

### Redis ElastiCache Cluster

The Amazon Connect Flow uses ElastiCache Clusters in order to store ordered list of actions for each call.

To configure the ElastiCache Cluster:

1. Create Subnet Group
   * In ElastiCache console, create a subnet group
   * Select your VPC and choose at least two subnets across different AZs
2. Create the Redis Cluster
   * Choose Redis as the engine
   * Select cluster mode (disabled/enabled)
   * Pick node type based on performance requirements

     <Note>
       The sizing is based on the amount of state that drives the memory and quantity of operations per second.

       You should size it based on the expected number of calls that will use GenerativeAgent.

       In this guide, we use a basic sizing. However you should test the sizing in your testing environments and size the VPC accordingly before launching to Production.
     </Note>
   * Choose Multi-AZ for enhanced reliability
   * Use the security group you created for the ElastiCache Cluster.
3. Connect the ElastiCache endpoint to the ASAPP-dedicated Amazon Connect Flow
   * Use the ElastiCache endpoint for all connections
   * Implement connection pooling
4. Save the Primary endpoint, it will be used as part of setting up the [lambda functions](#step-2-create-lambda-functions-to-call-generativeagent).

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/RedisCluster.png" />

<Tip>
  This guide make suggestions on setup but the configuration is ultimately up to you.

</Tip>

## Step 2: Create Lambda Functions to call GenerativeAgent

The GenerativeAgent Module expects certain Lambda functions to exist to interact with GenerativeAgent.

You will need to create the following Lambda functions:

* Engage
* PushAction
* PullAction

<Tip>
  Lambda samples are delivered in `Node.js 22.x`

  For other languages like Golang or Python, contact your ASAPP Team.
</Tip>

### Engage

This lambda function sends REST API requests to ASAPP and engages GenerativeAgent into a conversation.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment">
    The sample code uses the following Environment variables:

    | Name              | Description            | Value                                          |
    | :---------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
    | ASAPP\_API\_HOST  | Base URL for ASAPP API | [https://api.asapp.com](https://api.asapp.com) |
    | ASAPP\_API\_ID    | App-Id credential      | Provided by ASAPP                              |
    | ASAP\_API\_SECRET | App-Secret credential  | Provided by ASAPP                              |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Runtime">
    Choose the language for the function. The lambda sample is delivered in `Node.js 22.x`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Code">
    Reach out to your ASAPP team for the zip file containing the sample code you can upload to your lambda function.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="IAM Role">
    Assign `Engage` a unique IAM role as an execution role with the minimum policy allowing `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents` for all streams under your CloudWatch Log Group.

    Allow `lambda:InvokeFunction` action in your resource base policy.

    If you use automation, list `connect.amazonaws.com` as the Principal Service in your resource policy. Also list `AWS:SourceArn` as the ARN of your Amazon Connect in the Conditions table.

    <Tip>
      Necessary permissions are added automatically if you create the Lambda functions through the AWS Console.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="VPC and Security Groups">
    `Engage` only connects to internet endpoints, so do not attach it to a VPC.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### PullAction

This lambda function is called by the Amazon Connect Flow and queries Redis for next actions in a specific call.

The call identifier is the `contactId` taken from the `Event.ContactData`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment">
    | Name       | Description                    | Value                         |
    | :--------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
    | REDIS\_URL | URL of the Redis cluster setup | `redis://[PRIMARY_REDIS_URL]` |

    <Note>
      Use the primary endpoint created in the \[Redis ElastiCache Cluster]\(#redis- ElastiCache-cluster) for the `PRIMARY_REDIS_URL`.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Runtime">
    Choose the language for the function. The lambda sample is delivered in `Node.js 22.x`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Code">
    Reach out to your ASAPP team for the zip file containing the sample code you can upload to your lambda function.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="IAM Role">
    Assign `PullAction` a unique IAM role as an execution role with the minimum policy allowing `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents` for all streams under your CloudWatch Log Group.

    For VPC access, proper permissions should be part of the execution role as described in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html).

    Generally using the `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole` managed policy is enough.

    <Tip>
      Necessary permissions are added automatically if you create the Lambda functions through the AWS Console.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="VPC and Security Groups">
    Enable VPC access for the `PullAction` Lambda function and put it on the same VPC used by the [Redis ElastiCache Cluster](#redis-ElastiCache-cluster).

    You should also create a unique security group that will be locked down later.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### PushAction

ASAPP calls this lambda function to communicate a further action for each call GenerativeAgent is engaging.

This function also pushes next actions into Redis for `PullAction` to query at the next opportunity.

Save the ARN of the `PushAction` lambda function, it will be used when [configuring the IAM role](#step-3-configure-iam-roles-and-policies).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment">
    | Name       | Description                    | Value                         |

    For VPC access, proper permissions should be part of the execution role as described in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html).

    Generally using the `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole` managed policy is enough.

    <Tip>
      Necessary permissions are added automatically if you create the Lambda functions through the AWS Console.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="VPC and Security Groups">
    You must give access to `PushAction` to the dedicated Redis CLuster.

    Attach the Lambda function to the same VPC used by the ElastiCache Cluster defined in `redis-vpc-id`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Configure IAM Roles and Policies

As part of this integration, ASAPP services will reach out to your AWS account to invoke the lambda functions and access the Kinesis Video Streams.

ASAPP will need to assume a role in your AWS account to access these services.

We will provide you with the ARN of ASAPP's GenerativeAgent role. You need to create an IAM role for ASAPP to assume and specify the ARN of the IAM role in the trust policy.

To configure the IAM role and policies:

1. Create an IAM role with a custom trust policy:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "TrustASAPPRole",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "asapp-assuming-role-arn"
               },
               "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
           }
       ]
   }

   ```

   <Note>
     Replace the `asapp-assuming-role-arn` placeholder with the value provided by ASAPP.

     If there are multiple ARNs to trust, create multiple statements with unique Sid values and ASAPP provided ARN values in each statement.
   </Note>

   Don't immediately add permissions, instead you will add them after creation.
2. Add Kinesis Video Stream access to the IAM role by attaching the following permissions policy:

   <Note>
     Replace the `customer-account-id` with your AWS Account number and `kinesis-video-streams-prefix` with the value saved in the [Configure your Amazon Connect Instance](#configure-your-amazon-connect-instance) step.
   </Note>

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "ReadAmazonConnectStreams",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "kinesisvideo:GetDataEndpoint",
                   "kinesisvideo:GetMedia",
                   "kinesisvideo:DescribeStream"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:kinesisvideo:*:customer-account-id:stream/kinesis-video-streams-prefix*/*"
           },
           {
               "Sid": "ListAllStreams",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "kinesisvideo:ListStreams",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
3. Add Lambda Function access by attaching the following permissions policy to the IAM role.
   This will allow the ASAPP service to invoke lambda functions:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "Stmt1",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "lambda:InvokeFunction"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "lambda-pushaction-arn"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   <Note>
     Replace the `lambda-pushaction-arn` placeholder with the ARN of the [`PushAction` lambda function](#pushaction).
   </Note>
4. Share the IAM role ARN with ASAPP

   ASAPP will use the ARN to interact with the `PushAction` lambda and Kinesis Video Streams.

## Step 4: Add the GenerativeAgent Modules and Prompts

With the relevant components in place, you need to create or update a flow to use a GenerativeAgent Module to engage GenerativeAgent.

### Upload the Prompts

The GenerativeAgent Modules uses specific prompts during the conversation. ASAPP will provide you with a set of `.wav` files to be added as prompts in your Amazon Connect Instance.

Prompt modules must be named exactly as the .wav files are named so that the GenerativeAgent Module works correctly.

### Create GenerativeAgent Module

The GenerativeAgent Module will handle the conversation between the customer and GenerativeAgent.

You need to create the GenerativeAgent Module in your Amazon Connect Instance:

1. Receive the GenerativeAgent module json from ASAPP.
2. Edit the json to put in the correct ARNs.

   The Module will need to be updated with the correct ARNs to properly invoke the `Engage` and `PushAction` lambda functions.

   * Update the ARN that references the `Engage` lambda function to point to the `Engage` lambda function you created in [Step 2](#engage).
   * Update the ARN that references the `PushAction` lambda function to point to the `PushAction` lambda function you created in [Step 2](#pushaction).
3. Create a GenerativeAgent module.
   1. Within your Amazon Connect Instance, navigate to Routing > Flow > Modules.
   2. In the `Modules` section, click "Create flow module".
   3. Expand the "Save" dropdown and select "Import".
   4. Upload the edited JSON file and click "Import".

### Invoke the GenerativeAgent Module

To hand off a conversation to GenerativeAgent, you need to invoke the GenerativeAgent Module.

Most companies have many flows with nuanced logic and it is entirely up to you on when you engage the GenerativeAgent Module.

Once you have determined where within your flows you want to hand off a conversation to GenerativeAgent, you need to:

1. **Set GenerativeAgent Parameter**

   Create a "Set contact attributes" block and specify the `ASAPP_CompanyMarker`. This `ASAPP_CompanyMarker` is your company marker and must be passed to GenerativeAgent Module.
2. **Invoke GenerativeAgent Module**

   Create an "Invoke module" block and select the GenerativeAgent Module. This is where the conversation is handed off to GenerativeAgent.

   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/InvokeModule.png" />
   </Frame>

   Within the GenerativeAgent module, the flow will use the various components you created in previous steps to engage ASAPP's GenerativeAgent to the end user.

   Once the conversation is complete, GenerativeAgent will exit the module and return control to your flow.
3. **Handle the result**

   The GenerativeAgent module will exit for one of three reasons, and will be output the `ASAPP_Disposition` contact attribute with one of the following values:

   * `transferToAgent`: when the conversation needs to be transferred to an agent
   * `disengage`: when the conversation is completed
   * `error`: when an error has occurred

## Step 5: Engage GenerativeAgent

Now you are ready to make a call and engage GenerativeAgent.

Call the phone number configured in your Contact Flow and follow the prompts until you reach the point where GenerativeAgent is engaged. You should see the conversation transition to GenerativeAgent based on where you placed the GenerativeAgent Module in your flow.

Verify that:

1. You are handed off to GenerativeAgent
2. GenerativeAgent responds appropriately to your inputs
3. You are returned to your flow when the conversation ends

<Note>
  This integration is a good starting point for your integration with GenerativeAgent. You need to further configure the integration to meet your organization's requirements.

# AutoTranscribe Websocket
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/integrate/autotranscribe-websocket

Integrate AutoTranscribe for real-time speech-to-text transcription

Your organization can use AutoTranscribe to transcribe voice interactions between contact center agents and their customers, supporting various use cases including analysis, coaching, and quality management.

ASAPP AutoTranscribe is a streaming speech-to-text transcription service that works with both live streams and audio recordings of completed calls. Integrating your voice system with GenerativeAgent using the AutoTranscribe Websocket enables real-time communication, allowing for seamless interaction between your voice platform and GenerativeAgent's services.

AutoTranscribe is powered by a speech recognition model that transforms spoken form to written forms in real-time, including punctuation and capitalization. The model can be customized to support domain-specific needs by training on historical call audio and adding custom vocabulary to further boost recognition accuracy.

## How it works

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/at-websocket-howitworks.png" alt="AT-GA integration diagram" />
</Frame>

1. Create SSE Stream: The Event Handler (which may exist on the IVR or be a dedicated service) creates a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream with GenerativeAgent.

2. Audio Stream: The IVR sends the audio stream from the end user to AutoTranscribe.

3. Create Conversation: The IVR creates a conversation and adds messages to the Conversation Data.

4. Request Analysis: The IVR requests GenerativeAgent to analyze the conversation.

The Event Handler then handles events sent via SSE, including GenerativeAgent's reply, which is sent back to the user through the IVR.

## Benefits of using Websocket to Stream events

* Persistent connection between your voice system and the GenerativeAgent server
* API streaming for audio, call signaling, and returned transcripts
* Real-time data exchange for quick responses and efficient handling of user queries
* Bi-directional communication for smooth and responsive interaction

## Before you Begin

Before you start integrating to GenerativeAgent, you need to:

* [Get your API Key Id and Secret](/getting-started/developers)
* Ensure your API key has been configured to access AutoTranscribe and GenerativeAgent APIs. Reach out to your ASAPP team if you unsure.
* [Configure Tasks and Functions](/generativeagent/configuring "Configuring GenerativeAgent").

## Implementation Steps

1. Create AutoTranscribe Streaming URL
2. Listen and Handle GenerativeAgent Events
3. Open a Connection
4. Start an Audio Stream
5. Send the Audio Stream
6. Analyze the conversation with GenerativeAgent
7. Stop the Audio Stream

## Step 1: Create AutoTranscribe Streaming URL

First, you need to [create a streaming URL](/apis/autotranscribe/get-streaming-url) that will be the WebSocket connection to AutoTranscribe.

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/autotranscribe/v1/streaming-url' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "externalId": "<unique conversation id>"
}'
```

A successful response returns a 200 and a secure WebSocket short-lived access URL (TTL: 5 minutes):

```json
{
    "streamingUrl": "<short-lived access URL>"
}
```

## Step 2: Listen and Handle GenerativeAgent Events

GenerativeAgent sends events for all conversations through a single [Server-Sent-Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) (SSE) stream. [Listen and handle these events](/generativeagent/integrate/handling-events) to enable GenerativeAgent interaction with your users.

## Step 3: Open a Connection

Create the WebSocket connection using the access URL:

`wss://<internal-voice-gateway-ingress>?token=<short_lived_access_token>`

## Step 4: Start a stream audio message

Start streaming audio into the AutoTranscribe Websocket using this message sequence:

| Your Stream Request     | ASAPP Response          |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `startStream` message   | `startResponse` message |
| Stream audio - audio-in | `transcript` message    |
| `finishStream` message  | `finalResponse` message |

<Note>
  Format WebSocket protocol request messages as text (UTF-8 encoded string data); only the audio stream should be in binary format. All response messages will be formatted as text.
</Note>

Send a `startStream` message:

```json
{
   "message":"startStream",
   "sender": {
          "role": "customer",
          "externalId": "JD232442"
   }
}
```

You'll receive a `startResponse`:

```json
{
   "message": "startResponse",
   "streamID": "128342213",
   "status": {
          "code": "1000",
          "description": "OK"
   }
}
```

## Step 5: Send the audio stream

Stream audio as binary data:

`ws.send(<binary_blob>)`

You'll receive `transcript` messages:

```json
{
   "message": "transcript",
   "start": 0,
   "end": 1000,
   "utterance":
   [
      {"text": "Hi, my ID is 123."}
   ]
}
```

## Step 6: Analyze conversations with GenerativeAgent

Call the [`/analyze`](/apis/generativeagent/analyze-conversation) endpoint to evaluate the conversation:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "conversationId": "01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM"
}'
```

You can also include a message when calling analyze:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "conversationId": "01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM",
    "message": {
        "text": "hello, can I see my bill?",
        "sender": {
            "externalId": "321",
            "role": "customer"
        },
        "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:50:50Z"
    }
}'
```

As the conversation goes, it is possible to give GenerativeAgent more context of the conversation by using the`taskName` and `inputVariables` attributes.

You can also simulate Tasks and Input Variables in the [Previewer](/generativeagent/configuring/previewer#input-variables)

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'asapp-api-id: <api-key>' \
  --header 'asapp-api-secret: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "conversationId": "01BX5ZZKBKACTAV9WEVGEMMVS0",
  "message": {
    "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
    "sender": {
      "role": "agent",
      "externalId": 123
    },
    "timestamp": "2021-11-23T12:13:14.555Z"
  },
  "taskName": "UpgradePlan",
  "inputVariables": {
    "context": "Customer called to upgrade their current plan to GOLD",
    "customer_info": {
      "current_plan": "SILVER",
      "customer_since": "2020-01-01"
    }
  }
}'
```

## Step 7: Stop the streaming audio message

Send a `finishStream` message:

```json
{
   "message": "finishStream"
}
```

You'll receive a `finalResponse`:

```json
{
   "message": "finalResponse",
   "streamId": "128342213",
   "status": {
       "code": "1000",
       "description": "OK"
   },
   "summary": {
       "totalAudioBytes": 300,
       "audioDurationMs": 6000,
       "streamingSeconds": 6,
       "transcripts": 10
   }
}
```

# Example Interactions
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/integrate/example-interactions



While each type of integration may have some subtle differences on how replies are handled and sent to back to end users. They all still follow the same basic interaction pattern. These examples show some example scenarios, the API calls you would make, and the events you would receive.

* **[Simple Interaction](#simple-interaction "Simple interaction")**
* **[Conversation with an action that requires confirmation](#conversation-with-an-action-that-requires-confirmation "Conversation with an action that requires confirmation")**
* **[Conversation with authentication](#conversation-with-authentication "Conversation with authentication")**
* **[Conversation with transfer to an agent](#conversation-with-transfer-to-an-agent "Conversation with transfer to an agent")**

## Simple interaction

The example below shows a simple interaction with the GenerativeAgent. We first use the Conversation API to create a conversation, and then call the GenerativeAgent API to analyze a message from the customer.

**Request**
`POST /conversation/v1/conversations`

```json
{
 "externalId": "33411121",
 "agent": {
   "externalId": "671",
   "name": "agentname"
 },
 "customer": {
   "externalId": "11462",
   "name": "customername"
 },
 "metadata": {
   "queue": "some-queue"
 },
 "timestamp": "2024-01-23T13:41:20Z"
}
```

**Response**

Status 200: Successfully created the conversation.

```json
{
    "id": "01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3"
}
```

Now that we have a Conversation ID, we can use it to analyze a new message from our user, like the following:

**Request**

`POST /generativeagent/v1/analyze`

```json
{   
    "conversationId": "01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3",
    "message": {
        "text": "How can I pay my bill?",
        "sender": {
            "externalId": "11462",
            "role": "customer"
        },
        "timestamp": "2024-01-23T13:43:04Z"
    }
}
```

**Response**

Status 200: Successfully sent the analyze request and created the new message.

```json
{
    "conversationId": "01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3",
    "messageId": "01HMVXSWK8J9RR0PNGNN7Z4FVM"
}
```

**GenerativeAgent Events**

As a result of the analyze request, the following sequence of events will be sent to via the SSE stream:

```json
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '116aaf51-8180-47b7-9205-9f61c8799c52',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3',
  type: 'processingStart'
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '5c020ad9-4a25-4746-a345-017bb9711dbe',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMVXSZANHNGJ49R83HENDAJB',
    text: "I'm happy to help you! One moment please."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'd566fda8-3b7c-42a2-ae39-d08b66397238',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMVXTDR1AT9CNQXPYKKBPJ7F',
    text: 'You can pay your bill by calling (XXX) XXX-6094, using the Mobile App, or with a customer service agent over the phone (with a $5 fee).'
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'bba4320f-de53-4874-83b4-6c8704d3620c',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3',
  type: 'processingEnd'
}
```

## Conversation with an action that requires confirmation

In this use case, we go through a scenario that requires confirmation before the GenerativeAgent can execute a task on the user's behalf. Besides showing the payload of the GenerativeAgent Events that are sent from the GenerativeAgent, we also check the conversation state.

We assume there is an existing conversation with ID 01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ.

**Request**

`POST /generativeagent/v1/analyze`

```json
{   
    "conversationId": "01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ",
    "message": {
        "text": "hello, how can I reset my router?",
        "sender": {
            "externalId": "11462",
            "role": "customer"
        },
        "timestamp": "2024-01-21T15:08:50Z"
    }
}
```

**Response**

Status 200: Successfully sent the analyze request and created the new message.

```json
{
    "conversationId": "01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ",
    "messageId": "01HMSHVZGHAXDZMS722JS1JJJK"
}
```

**GenerativeAgent events**

As a result of the analyze request, the following sequence of events will be sent via the SSE stream:

```json
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '33843eb0-10f6-4531-a645-ed9481833301',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'processingStart'
}
{
  generativeAgentkMessageId: '0ed65d99-215d-48b4-be28-fee936f4757e',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMSQ946T9E3RCXHPNH1B65ZE',
    text: "I'm happy to help you! One moment please."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '1121411d-e68e-45d3-bf9e-f2a3db73e7ca',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMSQ96TWXB5DT4T259FP76RX',
    text: "Please say 'CONFIRM' to confirm the router reset. This action cannot be undone."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '3c4b0f55-c702-453c-9a76-db591f685213',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'processingEnd'
}
```

From the events above, we can see the GenerativeAgent requires user confirmation before it can proceed.

This can be done through another customer message (analyze API call). Optionally, we can check the current conversation state by calling the GET /state API, before the confirmation is sent:

**Request**

`GET /generativeagent/v1/state?conversationId=01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ`

**Response**

Status 200. We see the GenerativeAgent is waiting for confirmation for this conversation.

```json
{
    "state": "waitingForConfirmation",
    "lastGenerativeAgentMessageId": "3c4b0f55-c702-453c-9a76-db591f685213"
}
```

Now, the user sends the confirmation message:

**Request**

`POST /generativeagent/v1/analyze`

```json
{   
    "conversationId": "01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ",
    "message": {
        "text": "CONFIRM",
        "sender": {
            "externalId": "11462",
            "role": "customer"
        },
        "timestamp": "2024-01-21T15:09:10Z"
    }
}
```

**Response**

Status 200: Successfully sent the analyze request and created the new message.

```json
{
    "conversationId": "01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ",
    "messageId": "01HMVJTR2CPABZ46DM0QK1NS3T"
}
```

The analyze request triggers the following events:

```json
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'bae280e8-26c7-4333-ae8f-018e5f7140e9',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'processingStart'
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '7bcbab42-e64f-4e1b-9ec8-5db343d471e3',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMSQ946T9E3RCXHPNH1B65ZE',
    text: "Please wait while your router is being reset..."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'd0e3cb51-79e4-4b90-8c05-3f345090fbdf',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMSQ96TWXB5DT4T259FP76RX',
    text: "Router successfully reset."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '6af4172c-7bb7-4fa7-a338-b73a35be5d1c',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMSQ96TWXB5DT4T259FP76RX',
    text: "If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '008a21a0-af04-4ece-8f58-b7a0c82a1115',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ',
  type: 'processingEnd'
}
```

Finally, we can optionally check the state again. We see it changed back into "ready".

**Request**

`GET /generativeagent/v1/state?conversationId=01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ`

**Response**

```json
{
    "state": "ready",
    "lastGenerativeAgentMessageId": "008a21a0-af04-4ece-8f58-b7a0c82a1115"
}
```

## Conversation with authentication

In this scenario, the user tries to take an action that requires authentication first. GenerativeAgent will then ask for authentication via the GenerativeAgent event, which we can also confirm via the State API call. We'll authenticate and see the GenerativeAgent resuming the task.

We assume there is an existing conversation with ID *01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ*. Please see the first use case to understand how to create a new conversation.

**Request**

`POST /generativeagent/v1/analyze`

```json
{   
    "conversationId": "01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ",
    "message": {
        "text": "How much do I owe for my mobile?",
        "sender": {
            "externalId": "11462",
            "role": "customer"
        },
        "timestamp": "2024-01-23T15:49:37Z"
    }
}
```

**Response**

Status 200: Successfully sent the analyze request and created the new message.

```json
{
    "conversationId": "01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ",
    "messageId": "01HMSHT9KKHHBRMRKJTFZYRCKZ"
}
```

**GenerativeAgent events**

As a result of the analyze request, the following sequence of messages will be sent via the SSE stream:

```json
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '309181fd-be58-46fa-91b3-ea49f5f4b3d9',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'processingStart'
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '3122535a-3d0b-4bb5-a0ff-6c26616d2325',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMW172YTTESK1EG6A9Y8QRFZ',
    text: "I'm happy to help you! One moment please."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '49771949-c26e-49ab-86aa-5259d1a249ab',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'authenticationRequested'
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'd2d43ac5-e160-40fd-9c5b-773c8f7417e0',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'processingEnd'
}
```

We can see the second-to-last message is of type authenticationRequested. This tells us that the GenerativeAgent needs authentication in order to continue.

Additionally, we can check the conversation state, which is waitingForAuth:

**Request**

`GET /generativeagent/v1/state?conversationId=01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ`

**Response**

Status 200. We see the GenerativeAgent is waiting for confirmation for this conversation.

```json
{
  "state": "waitingForAuth",
  "lastGenerativeAgentMessageId": "d2d43ac5-e160-40fd-9c5b-773c8f7417e0"
}
```

Now let's call the authentication endpoint. Note that the specific format and content of the user credentials must be agreed upon between your organization and your ASAPP account team.

**Request**

`POST /conversation/v1/conversations/01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ/authenticate`

```json
{
    "customerExternalId": "33411121",
    "auth": {
        {{authentication payload}}
    }
}
```

**Response**

Status 204: Successfully sent the authenticate request no response body is expected.

**GenerativeAgent Events**

After a successful authenticate request, the GenerativeAgent will resume if it was waiting for auth. In this case, the following sequence of messages is sent via the SSE Stream:

```json
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '07df33e7-8603-4393-8ea2-ac29e35197c9',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'processingStart'
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'adfe3156-18fe-457b-b726-90c489478c80',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMY19BT31Z4AR05S0M5237EK',
    text: "Your current balance for your mobile account is $415.38, with no overdue amount and a past due amount of $10."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '3325ea14-5b73-4c7a-9511-a6faebc5c98c',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMY19CCJ9E8ENS34WNTQ29E2',
    text: 'There are 26 days remaining in your billing cycle.'
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '3325ea14-5b73-4c7a-9511-a6faebc5c98c',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMY15DGHYHVHZ5GYAXR1TDWS',
    text: 'For more information on your mobile billing, you can visit https://website.com'
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'd8785903-a680-4db5-a95f-ba9ed64a7aaa',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMW15N6V27Y4V2HRCE0CBZJQ',
  type: 'processingEnd'
}
```

## Conversation with transfer to an agent

This example showcases the bot transferring the conversation to an agent (a.k.a. agent escalation). 

We assume there is an existing conversation with ID *01HMY50MM3D5JP23NPWXKPQVD4*. Please see the first use case to understand how to create a new conversation.

**Request**

`POST /generativeagent/v1/analyze`

```json
{   
    "conversationId": "01HMY50MM3D5JP23NPWXKPQVD4",
    "message": {
        "text": "Can I talk to a real human?",
        "sender": {
            "externalId": "11462",
            "role": "customer"
        },
        "timestamp": "2024-01-24T11:35:23Z"
    }
}
```

**Response**

Status 200: Successfully sent the analyze request and created the new message.

```json
{
    "conversationId": "01HMY50MM3D5JP23NPWXKPQVD4",
    "messageId": "01HMY5FRHW3B76JSS3BVP1VJJX"
}
```

**GenerativeAgent Events**
As a result of the analyze request, the following sequence of messages will be sent via the SSE Stream:

```json
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '233e206d-a444-4736-9a66-1fde75e46df7',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',

  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMY50MM3D5JP23NPWXKPQVD4',
  type: 'transferToAgent'
}

The second-to-last message is of type transferToAgent. We can also optionally verify the conversation state by calling the state API:

**Request**

`GET /generativeagent/v1/state?conversationId=01HMY50MM3D5JP23NPWXKPQVD4`

**Response**

Status 200. We see the GenerativeAgent is waiting for confirmation for this conversation.

# Genesys AudioConnector for GenerativeAgent
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/integrate/genesys-audiohook

Learn how to integrate GenerativeAgent into Genesys Cloud using our Genesys AudioConnector integration.

The Genesys AudioConnector integration with ASAPP's GenerativeAgent allows callers in your Genesys Cloud CX contact center to have conversations with GenerativeAgent while maintaining the call entirely within your Genesys environment.

This guide demonstrates how to integrate GenerativeAgent using Genesys AudioConnector and ASAPP-provided components. It showcases how the various components work together, but you can adapt or replace any part of the integration to match your organization's requirements.

## How it works

At a high level, the Genesys AudioConnector integration with GenerativeAgent works by streaming audio and managing conversations through your Genesys Architect flows:

1. **Stream the audio** to GenerativeAgent through Genesys AudioConnector.
2. **GenerativeAgent handles the conversation** using the audio stream and responds to the caller.
   <Note>
     Since calls remain within your Genesys infrastructure throughout the interaction, you maintain full control over call handling, including error scenarios and transfers.
   </Note>
3. **Return control back** to your Genesys flow when:
   * The conversation is successfully completed
   * The caller requests a human agent
   * An error occurs

## Before you Begin

Before using the GenerativeAgent integration with Genesys Cloud CX, you need:

* [Get your API Key and Secret](/getting-started/developers#access-api-credentials)
  * Ensure your API key has been configured to access GenerativeAgent APIs. Reach out to your ASAPP team if you need access enabled.
* Have your dedicated **Base Connection URI** from ASAPP.
  * This is a URI you will use when configuring the Genesys Audiohook Monitor, provided by your ASAPP account team.
* Have an existing Genesys Cloud CX Instance
* Genesys Cloud CX administrator account with permissions for:
  * Managing integrations
  * Configuring Architect flows
  * Setting up Audiohook Monitor
  * Managing audio streaming settings

## Step 1: Configure Genesys Cloud CX Integration

First, you need to install and configure the ASAPP GenerativeAgent integration in your Genesys Cloud CX environment.

<Note>
  You will need to install a separate Audio Connector Integration for each ASAPP environment (Sandbox and Production).
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    From Admin Home, navigate to Integrations > Integrations. This is a list of third-party integrations you have available to install.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for AudioConnector">
    Use the search functionality to find the ASAPP Generative Agent integration, called "AudioConnector".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Install and complete the install wizard">
    Once completing the install, you are taken to the Integration Details page.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/integrate/genesys-integrations.png" alt="Genesys Integration Details" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name the Integration">
    You will have two sets of credentials, one for accessing the Production ASAPP environment and one for the Sandbox ASAPP environment. You will need to install a separate Audio Connector Integration for each.

    We highly recommend you include the appropriate environment when naming the connector, e.g. "ASAPP GenerativeAgent (Production)" or "ASAPP GenerativeAgent (Sandbox)"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Integration">
    1. Navigate to the Configuration tab > Properties and paste the **Base Connection URI**.
    2. Navigate to Credentials sub-tab and click "Configure".
       * Enter the **API Key** and **API Secret** for the appropriate environment and click "Ok".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the configuration">
    Ensure the integration is set to "Active".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Set Up Architect Flow

With the Audio Connector configured, you need to incorporate GenerativeAgent into your call flows. This is done by adding the GenerativeAgent Audio Connector to your Architect flows at the points where you want GenerativeAgent to handle the conversation.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/integrate/genesys-flow.png" alt="Genesys Audiohook Flow" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or modify an Architect flow">
    Open or create the Architect flow where you want to use GenerativeAgent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify insertion point">
    Determine where in the flow you want to add the GenerativeAgent Audio Connector.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the GenerativeAgent Audio Connector">
    * In the Toolbox, expand "Bot" and drag the Audio Connector module to the flow.

    <Note>
      The connector should be placed at the point where you want to hand off the conversation to GenerativeAgent.
    </Note>

    * Name the connector.
    * Specify a Connector ID.
      * This is not required, but we recommend versioning the connector ID for future version control.
    * Optionally, configure input session variables:
      * `customerId`: Passed directly as the customer ID in ASAPP's system
      * `taskName`: Used to [enter a specific task](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/enter-specific-task)
      * All other variables are passed as [Input Variables](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/input-variables)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Success and Failure results">
    When the GenerativeAgent Audio Connector is finished, it will return a result of either "Success" or "Failure".

    * **Success**: Indicates GenerativeAgent is transferring control back to your system or the caller has requested a human agent.
      * The block will return an output variable of `ASAPP_Disposition` with a value of:
        * `agent`: Indicates the caller requested a human agent.
        * `system`: Indicates GenerativeAgent has completed its task.
      * The block will also return output variables as defined in your tasks and functions as part of the [system transfer](/generativeagent/configuring/tasks-and-functions/system-transfer).
      * Configure your flow to route the conversation to the appropriate queue within Genesys Cloud.
    * **Failure**: Indicates an error occurred. Configure your flow to handle error scenarios, such as playing an error message to the caller and routing to a fallback option.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Test and Deploy

Before deploying to production, thorough testing is essential to ensure the integration works as expected and provides a good caller experience.

Test the integration thoroughly:

* Make test calls through the flow
  <Note>
    Test various scenarios including normal conversations or requests for human agents.
  </Note>
* Verify audio streaming quality and reliability
* Test conversation handling
  * Ensure GenerativeAgent understands and responds appropriately
  * Test different caller accents and speech patterns
  * Verify handling of background noise and interruptions
* Check error scenarios
  * Verify error handling paths in your flow

# Handling GenerativeAgent Events
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/integrate/handling-events



While analyzing a conversation, GenerativeAgent communicates back to you via events. These events are sent via a [Server-Sent-Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) stream.

The **single SSE stream** contain events for **all conversations** that are processed by GenerativeAgent.

Each event contains the id of the conversation it relates to, and the type of event.

Handling these events has 2 main steps:

1. Create SSE Stream
2. Handle the event

## Step 1: Create SSE Stream

To create an SSE stream for GenerativeAgent, first generate a streaming URL, and then initiate the SSE stream with that URL

To create the SSE stream URL, POST to `/streams`:

```json
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/streams' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{}'
```

A successful request returns 200 and the `streamingUrl` to use to create the SSE stream. Additionally it returns a `streamId`. Save this Id and use it to [reconnect SSE](#handle-sse-disconnects "Handle SSE disconnects") in-case the stream disconnects.

```json
{
    "streamId": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
    "streamingUrl": "https://ws-coradnor.asapp.com/push-api/connect/sse?token=token",
    "messageTypes": [
        "generative-agent-message"
    ]
}
```

The streaming URL is only valid for 30 seconds. After that time, the connection will be rejected and you will need to request a new URL.

Initiate the SSE stream by connecting to the URL and handle the events. How you connect to an SSE stream depends on the language you use and what are your preferred libraries. We include an [example in NodeJS](#code-sample "Code sample") below.

### Handle SSE disconnects

If your SSE connection breaks, reestablish the stream using the `streamId` returned in the original request.

```json
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativgeagent/v1/streams' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "streamId": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
}
```

A successful request returns 200 and the streaming URL you will reconnect with.

```json
{
   "streamId": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
   "streamingUrl": "https://ws-coradnor.asapp.com/push-api/connect/sse?token=token", 
  "messageTypes": [
    "generative-agent-message"
  ]
}
```

Save the `streamId` to use in your `/analyze` requests. This will send all the GenerativeAgent messages for that analyze request, to this SSE stream.

## Step 2: Handle events

You need to process each event from GenerativeAgent. The data sent via SSE needs to be parsed into a JSON, and then handled accordingly.

Determining the conversation the event pertains to and take the necessary action depending on the event `type`.

For a given analyze request on a conversation, you may receive any of the following event types:

* **`processingStart`**: The bot started processing. This can be used to trigger user feedback such as showing a "typing" indicator.
* **`authenticationRequired`**: Some API Connections require additional User authentication. Refer to [User authentication required](#user-authentication-required "User Authentication Required") for more information.
* **`reply`**: The bot has a reply for the conversation. We will automatically create a message for the bot, but you will need to send back the response to your user. This can be text directly when on a text based system, or your TTS for voice channels.
* **`processingEnd`**: The bot finished processing. This indicates there will be no further events until analyze is called again.
* **`transferToAgent`**: The bot could not handle the request and the conversation should be transferred to an agent.
* **`transferToSystem`**: The bot is transferring control to an external system. This is a system transfer function.

Here is an example set of events where analyze is called:

```json
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '116aaf51-8180-47b7-9205-9f61c8799c52',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3',
  type: 'processingStart'
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: '5c020ad9-4a25-4746-a345-017bb9711dbe',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMVXSZANHNGJ49R83HENDAJB',
    text: "I'm happy to help you! One moment please."
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'd566fda8-3b7c-42a2-ae39-d08b66397238',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3',
  type: 'reply',
  reply: {
    messageId: '01HMVXTDR1AT9CNQXPYKKBPJ7F',
    text: 'You can pay your bill by calling (XXX) XXX-6094, using the Mobile App, or with a customer service agent over the phone (with a $5 fee).'
  }
}
{
  generativeAgentMessageId: 'bba4320f-de53-4874-83b4-6c8704d3620c',
  externalConversationId: '33411121',
  conversationId: '01HMVXRVSA1EGC0CHQTF1X2RN3',
  type: 'processingEnd'
}
```

## User Authentication Required

A key power of GenerativeAgent is it's ability to call your APIs to look up information or perform an action. These are determined by the [API Connections](/generativeagent/configuring/connect-apis) you create.

Some APIs require end user authentication. When this is the case, we sent the `authenticationRequested` event. Work with your ASAPP team to determine those authentication needs and what needs to passed back to ASAPP.

Based on the specifics of your API, you will need to gather the end user authentication information and call [`/authenticate`](/apis/conversations/authenticate-a-user-in-a-conversation) on the conversation:

```json
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations/[conversation Id]/authenticate' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "customerExternalId": "[Your Id of the customer]",
    "auth": {
        {{Your predetermined authentication payload}}
    }
}'
```

A successful response returns a 204 response and no body. GenerativeAgent will continue processing and send you subsequent events.

## Code sample

Here is an example of initiate the SSE stream and listening for the events using nodeJS. This uses [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to get the URL and the [EventSource](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventsource) package for handling the events:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import EventSource from 'eventsource';
const response = await axios.post('https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/streams', {}, {
    headers: {
        'asapp-api-id': '[Your API key id]',
        'asapp-api-secret': '[Your API secret]',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
});
console.log('Using streaming URL:', response.data.streamingUrl);
const eventSource = new EventSource(response.data.streamingUrl);
eventSource.onopen = (event) => {
    console.log('Connection opened:', event.type);
};
eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
    console.error('EventSource failed:', error);
    eventSource.close();
};
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log('Received uncategorized data:', event.data);
};
eventSource.addEventListener('status', (event) => {
    console.log('Received status ping:', event.data);
})
eventSource.addEventListener('generative-agent-message', (event) => {
    console.log('Received generative-agent-message:', event.data);
    try {
        const parsedData = JSON.parse(event.data);
        console.log('Parsed data:', parsedData);
        // Handle different event types here
        switch (parsedData.type) {
            case "processingStart":
                console.log("Bot started processing.");
                break;
            case "authenticationRequired":
                console.log("Initiate customer authentication.");
                break;
            case "reply":
                console.log("GenerativeAgent responded:", parsedData.content);
                break;
            case "processingEnd":
                console.log("Bot finished processing");
                break;
            case "transferToAgent":
                console.log("Bot could not handle request, transfer to a live agent.");
                break;
            default:
                console.log("Unknown event type:", parsedData.type);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error parsing event data:', error);
    }
})
```

This example is intended to be illustrative only.

## Event Schema

Each event is a json format with several fields with the following specification:

| Field Name                          | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Text-only GenerativeAgent
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/integrate/text-only-generativeagent



You have the option to integrate with GenerativeAgent using only text. This may be helpful if you:

* Have your own Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) service.
* Adding GenerativeAgent to a text only channel like SMS or web site chat.

GenerativeAgent works on a loop where you will send text content of the conversation and have GenerativeAgent analyze a conversation, then handle the results from GenerativeAgent.

This process is repeated until GenerativeAgent addresses the user's needs, or GenerativeAgent is unable to help the user and requests a transfer to agent.

Your text-only integration needs to handle:

* Listening and Handling GenerativeAgent events. Create a single SSE stream where events from all conversations are sent.
* Connecting your chat system and trigger GenerativeAgent.

  1. Create a conversation
  2. Add Messages
  3. Analyze a conversation

This diagram shows the interaction between your server and ASAPP, these steps are explained in more detail below:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-bac0fecf-d073-d2b0-773c-ba672131603b.png" />
</Frame>

## Before you Begin

Before you start integrating to GenerativeAgent, you need to:

* [Get your API Key Id and Secret](/getting-started/developers)
* Ensure your API key has been configured to access GenerativeAgent APIs. Reach out to your ASAPP team if you unsure.
* [Configure Tasks and Functions](/generativeagent/configuring).

## Step 1: Listen and Handle GenerativeAgent Events

GenerativeAgent sends you events during the conversation. All events for all conversations being evaluated by GenerativeAgent are sent through the single [Server-Sent-Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) (SSE) stream..

To create the SSE stream URL, POST to [`/streams`](/apis/generativeagent/create-stream-url):

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/streams' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{}'
```

A successful request returns 200 and the streaming URL you will reconnect with.

```json
{
   "streamId": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
   "streamingUrl": "https://ws-coradnor.asapp.com/push-api/connect/sse?token=token", 
  "messageTypes": [
    "generative-agent-message"
  ]
}
```

Save the `streamId`. You will use this later to send the GenerativeAgent events to this SSE stream.

You need to [listen and handle these events](/generativeagent/integrate/handling-events) to enable GenerativeAgent to interact with your users.

## Step 2: Create a Conversation

A `conversation` represents a thread of messages between an end user and one or more agents. GenerativeAgent evaluates and responds in a given conversation.

[Create a `conversation`](/apis/conversations/create-or-update-a-conversation) providing your Ids for the conversation and customer:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ 
  "externalId": "1",
  "customer": {   
    "externalId": "[Your id for the customer]",
    "name": "customer name" 
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
}'
```

A successfully created conversation returns a status code of 200 and the conversation's `id`. Save the conversation id as it is used when calling GenerativeAgent

```json
{"id":"01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM"}
```

## Step 3: Add messages

Whether you are implementing a text based channel or using your own transcription, provide the utterances from your users by creating **`messages`**. A `message` represents a single communication within a conversation.

[Create a `message`](/apis/messages/create-a-message) providing the text of what your user said:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations/01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM/messages' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ 
  "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
  "sender": {   
    "role": "customer",
    "externalId": "[Your id for the customer]" 
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
}'
```

Continue to provide the messages while the conversation progresses.

<Note>
  You can provide a single message as part of the `/analyze` call if that better works with the design of your system.
</Note>

## Step 4: Analyze conversation with GenerativeAgent

Once you have the SSE stream connected and are sending messages, you need to engage GenerativeAgent with a given conversation.

To have GenerativeAgent analyze a conversation, make a [POST request to  `/analyze`](/apis/generativeagent/analyze-conversation):

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "conversationId": "01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM",
    "streamId": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV"
}'
```

Make sure to include the `streamId` created when you started the SSE Stream.

GenerativeAgent evaluates the conversation at that moment of time to determine a response. GenerativeAgent is not aware of any additional messages that are sent while processing.

A successful response returns a 200 and the conversation Id.

```json
{
  "conversationId":"01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM"
}
```

GenerativeAgent's response is communicated by the [events](/generativeagent/integrate/handling-events) sent through the SSE stream.

### Analyze with Message

You have the option to send a message when calling analyze.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "conversationId": "01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM",
    "streamId": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
    "message": {
        "text": "hello, can I see my bill?",
        "sender": {
            "externalId": "321",
            "role": "customer"
        },
        "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:50:50Z"
    }
}'
```

A successful response returns a 200 status code the id of the conversation and the message that was created.

```json
{
  "conversationId":"01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM",
  "messageId":"01HNE6ZEAC94ENQT1VF2EPZE4Y"
}
```

### Add Input Variables and Task context

As the conversation goes, it is possible to give GenerativeAgent more context of the conversation by using the`taskName` and `inputVariables` attributes.

You can also simulate Tasks and Input Variables in the [Previewer](/generativeagent/configuring/previewer#input-variables)

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'asapp-api-id: <api-key>' \
  --header 'asapp-api-secret: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "conversationId": "01BX5ZZKBKACTAV9WEVGEMMVS0",
  "message": {
    "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
    "sender": {
      "role": "agent",
      "externalId": 123
    },
    "timestamp": "2021-11-23T12:13:14.555Z"
  },
  "taskName": "UpgradePlan",
  "inputVariables": {
    "context": "Customer called to upgrade their current plan to GOLD",
    "customer_info": {
      "current_plan": "SILVER",
      "customer_since": "2020-01-01"
    }
  }
}'
```

# UniMRCP Plugin for ASAPP
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/integrate/unimrcp-plugin-for-asapp



ASAPP offers a plugin for speech recognition for the UniMRCP Server (UMS).

<Note>
  Speech-related clients use Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) to control media service resources including:

  * **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
  * **Automatic Speech Recognizers (ASR)**
</Note>

To connect clients with speech processing servers and manage the sessions between them, MRCP relies on other protocols to work. Also, MRCP defines the messages to control the media service resources and it also defines the messages that provide the status of the media service resources.

Once established, the MRCP protocol exchange operates over the control session, allowing your organization to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/unimrcp-overview.png" />
</Frame>

This plugin connects your IVR Platform into the AutoTranscribe Websocket. It is a fast solution for your organization to quickly integrate your IVR application into GenerativeAgent.

By using the ASAPP UniMRCP Plugin, the GenerativeAgent receives text transcripts from your IVR. This way, your organization takes voice media off your IVR and into the ASAPP Cloud.

## Before you Begin

Before you start integrating to GenerativeAgent, you need to:

* [**Get your API Key Id and Secret**](/getting-started/developers)

  For authentication, the UniMRCP server connects with AutoTranscribe using standard websocket authentication. The ASAPP UniMRCP Plugin does not handle authentication, but rather authentication is on your IVR's side of the call.
  Your API credentials are used by the configuration document. For user identification or verification, you must handle it by the IVRs policies and flows.
* Ensure your API key has been configured to access GenerativeAgent APIs and the AutoTranscribe WebSocket. Reach out to your ASAPP team if you are unsure about this.
* **Use ASAPPs ASR**

  Make sure your IVR application uses the ASAPP ASR so AutoTranscribe can receive it and send transcripts to GenerativeAgent.
* [Configure Tasks and Functions](/generativeagent/configuring).

  By using the Plugin, you still need to save customer info and messages. The GenerativeAgent can save that data by sending it into its Chat Core, but your organization can also save the messages either by calling the API or by saving the information from each event handler.

  Your IVR application is in control of when to call /analyze so the GenerativeAgent analyzes the transcripts and replies. The recommended configuration is to call /analyze every time an utterance or transcript is returned.

  Another approach is to call LLMBot when a complete thought/question is provided. Some organizations may find a good solution call /analyze and buffer up transcripts until the customer's thought is complete.

  <Step title="Listen and Handle GenerativeAgent Events" />

  <Step title="Setup the UniMRCP ASAPP Plugin" />

  <Step title="Manage the Transcripts and send them to GenerativeAgent" />
</Steps>

## Step 1: Listen and Handle GenerativeAgent Events

GenerativeAgent sends events during any conversation. All events for all conversations being evaluated by GenerativeAgent are sent through the single [Server-Sent-Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) (SSE) stream..

You need to [listen and handle these events](/generativeagent/integrate/handling-events) to enable GenerativeAgent to interact with your users.

## Step 2: Setup the UniMRCP ASAPP Plugin

On your UniMRCP server, you need to install and configure the ASAPP UniMRCP Plugin.

### Install the ASAPP UniMRCP Plugin

<Note>
  Go to [ASAPP's UniMCRP Plugin Public Documentation](https://docs.unispeech.io/en/ums/asapp) to install and see its usage
</Note>

### Use the Recommended Plugin Configuration

**Fields & Parameters**

After you install the UniMCRP ASAPP Plugin, you need to configure the request fields so the prompts are sent in the best way and GenerativeAgent gets the most information available.

Having the recommended configuration will ensure GenerativeAgent analyzes each prompt correctly.

Here are the details for the fields with the recommended configuration:

**Transcript Message Response Fields**

All Responses go to the MRCP Server, so the only visible return is a VXML return of the field.

| Field     |      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Format | Example Syntax      |
| :-------- | :--- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :------------------ |
| utterance | text | The written text of the utterance. While an utterance can have multiple alternatives (e.g., 'me two' vs. 'me too') ASAPP provides only the most probable alternative only, based on model prediction confidence. | array  | "Hi, my ID is 123." |

If the `detailedToken` in `startStream` request is set to true, additional fields are provided within the `utterance` array for each `token`:

| Field | Subfield          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        | Format  | Example Syntax |

|       | punctuationBefore | Optional, punctuation attached in front of the content                                                                                                                                             | string  | '"'            |

## Step 3: Manage Transcripts

You need to both pass the conversation transcripts to ASAPP, as well as request GenerativeAgent to analyze the conversation.

### Create a Conversation

You need to create the conversation with GenerativeAgent for each IVR call.

A **`conversation`** represents a thread of messages between an end user and one or more agents. GenerativeAgent evaluates and responds in a given conversation.

Create a `conversation` providing your Ids for the conversation and customer:

```json
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ 
  "externalId": "1",
  "customer": {   
    "externalId": "[Your id for the customer]",
    "name": "customer name" 
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:42:42Z"
}'
```

A successfully created conversation returns a status code of 200 and the conversation's id.

```json
{"id":"01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM"}
```

As the conversation goes, it is possible to give GenerativeAgent more context of the conversation by using the`taskName` and `inputVariables` attributes.

You can also simulate Input Variables in the [Previewer](/generativeagent/configuring/previewer#input-variables)

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'asapp-api-id: <api-key>' \
  --header 'asapp-api-secret: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "conversationId": "01BX5ZZKBKACTAV9WEVGEMMVS0",
  "message": {
    "text": "Hello, I would like to upgrade my internet plan to GOLD.",
    "sender": {
      "role": "agent",

#### Gather transcripts and analyze conversations with GenerativeAgent

After you receive the conversation transcripts from the UniMRCP Plugin, you must call /analyze and other endpoints so GenerativeAgent evaluates the conversation and send a reply.

You can decide when to call the GenerativeAgent, a common strategy is to define an immediate call after a transcript is returned from the MRCP client

Additionally, the GenerativeAgent will make API Calls to your Organization depending on the Tasks and Functions that were configured for the Agent.

Once you have the SSE stream connected and are receiving messages, you need to engage GenerativeAgent with a given conversation. All messages are sent through REST outside of the SSE channels.

To have GenerativeAgent analyze a conversation, make a [POST request to  `/analyze`](/apis/generativeagent/analyze-conversation):

```json
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "conversationId": "01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM"
}'
```

GenerativeAgent evaluates the transcript at that moment of time to determine a response. GenerativeAgent is not aware of any additional transcript messages that are sent while processing.

A successful response returns a 200 and the conversation Id.

```json
{
  "conversationId":"01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM"
}
```

GenerativeAgent's response is communicated via the [events](/generativeagent/integrate/handling-events).

**Analyze with Message**

You have the option to send a message when calling analyze.

```json
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/generativeagent/v1/analyze' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "conversationId": "01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM",
    "message": {
        "text": "hello, can I see my bill?",
        "sender": {
            "externalId": "321",
            "role": "customer"
        },
        "timestamp": "2024-01-23T11:50:50Z"
    }
}'
```

A successful response returns a 200 status code the id of the conversation and the message that was created.

```json
{
  "conversationId":"01HNE48VMKNZ0B0SG3CEFV24WM",
  "messageId":"01HNE6ZEAC94ENQT1VF2EPZE4Y"
}
```

# Reporting
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/generativeagent/reporting

Learn how to track and analyze GenerativeAgent's performance.

Monitoring how GenerativeAgent handles customer interactions is critical for ensuring optimal performance and customer satisfaction.

By tracking key metrics around containment and task completion, you can continuously improve GenerativeAgent's effectiveness and identify areas for optimization.

You can access GenerativeAgent reporting data in two ways:

| Reporting Option              | Capabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Availability                                   |

<Note> Dashboards are available only once you are in production. </Note>

## Out-of-the-box dashboards

The fastest way to start monitoring GenerativeAgent is through our pre-built dashboards. To access them depends on whether you are using ASAPP Messaging or running GenerativeAgent standalone.

These dashboards show you:

* Volume and containment over time
* Containment by task
* Intent and task breakdowns

<Note>
  We only provide out-of-the-box dashboards for GenerativeAgent running on [ASAPP Messaging](/messaging-platform).
</Note>

Access GenerativeAgent reporting through the [Historical Insights interface](/messaging-platform/insights-manager#historical-insights):

1. Navigate to **ASAPP Core Digital Dashboards** -> **Automation & Flow** -> **GenerativeAgent**
2. Select **GenerativeAgent Quality Metrics**

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/generativeagent/generativeagent-dashboards.png" />
</Frame>

## Data feeds

For deeper analysis, or to integrate GenerativeAgent metrics with your existing analytics infrastructure, you can pipe GenerativeAgent's data directly into your system using:

* [File Exporter APIs](/reporting/file-exporter) for standalone GenerativeAgent.
* [Download from S3](/reporting/retrieve-messaging-data) if you are using our [Messaging Platform](/messaging-platform).

This approach is recommended when you need to:

* Combine GenerativeAgent metrics with other customer journey data
* Build custom dashboards in your BI tools
* Perform advanced analytics across channels
* Track end-to-end customer interactions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="File Exporter">
    Use File Exporter to export data from a standalone GenerativeAgent. When exporting data via the File Exporter APIs, you need to specify a `feed` of **generativeagent**.

    Reports are generated hourly.

    Here is an example to get a list of files in the generativeagent feed for a given day:

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedfiles \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'asapp-api-id: <api-key>' \
      --header 'asapp-api-secret: <api-key>' \
      --data '{
      "feed": "generativeagent",
      "version": "1",
      "format": "jsonl",
      "date": "2024-06-27",
      "interval": "hr=23"
    }'
    ```

    Refer to the [File Exporter documentation](/reporting/file-exporter) for more details on the listing and retrieving files.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Download from S3">
    Use S3 to download data exported from the Messaging Platform. When exporting data via S3, you will need to specify the `FEED_NAME` as **generativeagent**.

    Refer to the [Download from S3](/reporting/retrieve-messaging-data) guide for more details on the file structure and how to access the data.

# Developer Quickstart
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/getting-started/developers

Learn how to get started using ASAPPs APIs

Most of ASAPP's products require a combination of configuration and implementation, and making API calls is part of a successful integration.

<Warning> If you are **only** integrating ASAPP Messaging and **no other ASAPP product**, then you can skip this quickstart and go straight to [ASAPP Messaging](/messaging-platform) guide.</Warning>

To get started making API calls, you need to:

* [Log in to the developer portal](#log-in-to-the-developer-portal)
* [Understand Sandbox vs Production](#understanding-sandbox-and-production)
* [Access your application's API Credentials](#access-api-credentials)
* [Make your first API call](#make-first-api-call)

## Log in to the developer portal

The developer portal is where you will:

* Grant access to developers and manage your team.
* Manage your API keys.

As part of [onboarding](/getting-started/intro), you would have appointed someone as the Developer Portal Admin. This user is in control of adding users and adjusting user access within the Dev Portal.

### Managing the developer portal

The developer portal uses **teams** and **apps** to manage access.

The members of your team can have one of the following roles:

* **Owner**: This user controls the team; this user is also called the Developer Portal Admin.
* **App Admin**: These users are able to change the information on applications owned by the team.
* **Viewers**: These users can view API credentials, but cannot change any settings.

Apps represent access to all of ASAPP's products. Your team will already have an app created for you. One app can access all of ASAPP's products. There can be one or more keys for the app; by default, an initial API key will already be generated.

The ASAPP email login or SSO only grants access to the dev portal, all permission and team management must be done from within the developer portal tooling.

## Understand Sandbox and Production

Initially, you only have access to the sandbox environment and we will create a Sandbox team and app for you. The sandbox is where you can initially build your integration but also try out new features before launching in production.

The different environments are represented in ASAPP's API Domains:

| Environment | API Domain                      |
| :---------- | :------------------------------ |
| Sandbox     | `https://api.sandbox.asapp.com` |
| Production  | `https://api.asapp.com`         |

ASAPP's sandbox environment uses the same machine learning models and services as the production environment in order to replicate expected behaviors when interacting with a given endpoint.

<Warning>All requests to ASAPP sandbox and production APIs **must** use HTTPS protocol. Traffic using HTTP will not be redirected to HTTPS.</Warning>

### Moving to Production

Once you are ready to move to launch with real traffic and move to production, request production access. Tell your ASAPP account team which user will be the Production Developer Portal Admin. ASAPP will create a dedicated production team and app that you can manage as you did for the sandbox team and app.

## Access API Credentials

To access your API credentials, once you've logged in:

* Click your username and click Apps
  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/getting-started/dev-portal-access.png" />
  </Frame>
* Click your Sandbox App.
* Navigate down to API Keys and copy your API Id and API Secret
  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/getting-started/dev-portal-app.png" />
  </Frame>

Save the API Id and Secret. All API requests use these for authentication.

## Make First API Call

With credentials in hand, we can make our first API call. Let's start with creating a `conversation`, the root entity for any interaction within a call center.

This example creates an empty conversation with required id from your system. You need to include the API Id and Secret as `asapp-api-id` and `asapp-api-secret` headers respectively.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/conversation/v1/conversations' \
--header 'asapp-api-id: <API KEY ID>' \
--header 'asapp-api-secret: <API TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ 
  "externalId": "con_1",
  "customer": {   
    "externalId": "cust_1234"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-12-12T11:42:42Z"
}'
```


# Error Handling
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/getting-started/developers/error-handling

Learn how ASAPP returns Errors in the API

When you make an API call to ASAPP and there is an error, you will receive a non `2XX` HTTP status code.

All errors return a `message`, `code`, and `requestId` for that request to help you debug the issue.

The message will usually contain enough information to help you resolve the issue. If you require further help, reach out to support, including the requestId so that they can pinpoint the specific failing API call.

## Error Structure

| Field           | Type   | Description                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| error           | object | The main error object containing details about the error                     |
| error.requestId | string | A unique identifier for the request that resulted in this error              |
| error.message   | string | A detailed description of the error, including the specific validation issue |
| error.code      | string | An error code in the format "HTTP\_STATUS\_CODE-ERROR\_SUBCODE"              |

Here is an example where a timestamp in the request has an incorrect format.

```json
{
  "error":{
    "requestId":"3851a807-f0c3-4873-8ba6-5bad4261f0ca3100",
    "message":"ERROR - [Path '/timestamp'] String 2024-08-14T00:00:00.000K is invalid against requested date format(s) [yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.[0-9]{1,12}Z]: []]",
    "code":"400-03"
  }
}
```


# Health Check
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/getting-started/developers/health-check

Check the operational status of ASAPP's API platform

ASAPP provides a simple endpoint to check if our API services are operating normally. You can use this to verify the platform's availability or implement automated health monitoring.

## Checking API Health

Send a GET request to the [health check](/apis/health-check/check-asapps-apis-health) endpoint:

```bash
curl https://api.sandbox.asapp.com/v1/health \
  -H "asapp-api-id: YOUR_API_ID" \
  -H "asapp-api-secret: YOUR_API_SECRET"
```

A successful response will return:

```json
{
  "healthCheck": "SUCCESS"
}
```

The status will be either `SUCCESS` when operating normally or `FAILED` if there are service disruptions.


# API Rate Limits and Retry Logic
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/getting-started/developers/rate-limits

Learn about API rate limits and recommended retry logic.

ASAPP implements rate limits on our APIs to ensure system stability and optimal performance for all users. To maintain a smooth integration with our APIs, you need to:

1. Be aware of the rate limits in different environments
2. Implement retry logic to handle rate limit errors effectively

## Rate Limits

| Environment | Daily Limit                                | Daily Limit Reset Time | Spike Arrest Limit              |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Sandbox     | 10,000 requests per AI Service             | 00:00:00 UTC           | 100 requests/second per Product |
| Production  | 50,000 requests per AI Service (default)\* | 00:00:00 UTC           | 100 requests/second per Product |

\*Production limits are configured for each service implementation and are set with ASAPP account teams during request volume forecasting.

ASAPP sets these limits to prevent API abuse rather than restrict regular expected usage. If your implementation is expected to approach or exceed these limits, contact your ASAPP account team in advance to discuss potential changes and prevent service interruptions.

## Behavior When Limits are Reached

If daily limits are reached:

* Calls to the endpoint will receive a 429 'Too Many Requests' response status code for the remainder of the day.
* In cases of suspected abuse, API tokens may be revoked to temporarily suspend access to production services. ASAPP will inform you via ServiceDesk in such cases.

## Recommended Retry Logic

ASAPP recommends implementing the following retry logic using an exponential backoff strategy in response to 429 and 5xx errors:

### On 429 Errors

* 1st retry: 1s delay
* 2nd retry: 2s delay
* 3rd retry: 4s delay

### On 5xx Errors and Other Retriable Codes

* 1st retry: 250ms delay
* 2nd retry: 500ms delay
* 3rd retry: 1000ms delay

<Note>
  Do not implement retries for error codes that typically indicate request errors:

  * 400 Bad Request
  * 403 Forbidden
  * 404 Not Found
</Note>


# Setup ASAPP
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/getting-started/intro

Learn how to get started with ASAPP

To get started with ASAPP, you need to:

1. Create and access your account with ASAPP
2. Invite Users and Developers
3. Configure and Integrate your products

## Create and access your account

The first step with ASAPP is getting your own account. If you haven't already, [request a demo](https://ai-console.asapp.com/). During the initial conversations, an ASAPP member would have asked you for the following:

* Display name of company
* Admin user email: This user will be granted initial admin access and can invite subsequent users.
* Developer email: This is the user who is responsible for the technical integration. They will receive access to the developer portal.

An account will be created for you, this account is sometimes referred to as an **organization name** or **company marker**.

This company marker is your main account with ASAPP and includes all configuration, user management, and login settings for your account.

When you login to the [ASAPP dashboard](https://ai-console.asapp.com/), called the AI Console, you will need to specify your **organization**, and then login with your email.

<Note>At first, login is based on your email, though we do support SSO authentication.</Note>

If you don't have an account, you can [reach out](https://www.asapp.com/get-started) to see a demo and get an account.

### Multiple company markers

Most users only need a single company marker. If you require different sets configuration such as different sub entities with different configuration needs, you may require multiple company markers.

Work with your ASAPP account team to determine the best account structure for your business.

## Invite Users and Developers

Once you have access to your account and the [ASAPP dashboard](https://ai-console.asapp.com/). You need to invite your teammates to access relevant products. Most products are fully managed within the AI Console.

<Note>[ASAPP Messaging](/messaging-platform) has a separate dashboard to configure the platform compared to the [Agent Desk](/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk) where your agents login and interact with your customers.</Note>

For developers, we would have already requested for your developer's email to get them access to the developer portal where they can manage API Keys. Point your developers to the [developer quickstart](/getting-started/developers).

## Configure and Integrate your products

With access to your account and inviting your users, you need to configure and implement your products.

Each product has its own instructions on how to configure and implement. Follow the appropriate steps per product:

# Audit Logs
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/getting-started/setup/audit-logs

Learn how to view, search, and export audit logs to track changes in AI Console.

All activities in AI Console are saved as events and are viewable in audit logs. These logs provide a detailed record of configuration changes made in AI-Console for AI Services and ASAPP Messaging.

These records are saved indefinitely, providing administrators with a comprehensive historical view of changes made to ASAPP services, including when they were made and by whom.

Administrators of your ASAPP organization can access audit logs.

Audit logs allow you to:

* See the most recent changes made to every resource.
* Investigate a particular historical change associated with a deployment.
* Review activity for a given user or product over the course of weeks or months.

To access Audit Logs:

1. Navigate to the AI-Console home page
2. Select Admin

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-4c72fddf-e958-b9d7-08a1-94132217ed81.png" alt="View of the audit logs landing page." />
</Frame>

The following list displays the resources being tracked:

* **General**
  * Links
  * Custom entities
* **Virtual Agent**
  * Flows
  * Intent routing
* **AutoCompose**
  * Global responses

## Audit Logs Entries

For each audit log record, the following fields are recorded:

| Field         | Description                                                                           |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Resource type | Type of resource modified.                                                            |
| Resource name | Name of the resource modified.                                                        |
| Event type    | Type of event. Supported fields are create, deploy, undeploy, update, and delete.     |
| Environment   | Environment to which the resource was deployed to. Only applicable for deploy events. |
| User          | Name of user who caused the event.                                                    |
| Timestamp     | Time and date the event occurred, in UTC format.                                      |
| Unique ID     | (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource.                                        |

## Searching Audit Logs

Administrators can use the search bar to look for a specific resource name, or user.

To search your audit logs, navigate to the search bar on the top-right corner of the screen.

<Note>
  The search functionality searches for exact matches with either the resource name, or the user that made the change.
</Note>

Additionally, you can filter the results of the audit logs by using the filter dropdown menus.

You can filter by the following fields:

* Resource type
* Event type
* User
* Date

<Tip>
  You can additionally click on the "timestamp" column to re-order the results by ascending or descending dates:

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-0beb7055-4087-4d8b-da5e-d11b5a3c7b54.png" alt="Timestamp column highlighted on the Audit Logs main view." />
  </Frame>
</Tip>

## Exporting Audit Logs

Administrators can download the audit logs as a CSV file to store and review later. If you export the audit logs as a .csv file after filtering them using the search bar or filters, the downloaded file will also be filtered.

To download the audit logs as a .csv file:

1. Navigate to the Audit Logs section in AI Console.
2. Click on the download button, next to the search bar.

Data in audit logs will be recorded from the time the feature is enabled. Historical activity will not be displayed retroactively.


# Manage Users
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/getting-started/setup/manage-users

Learn how to set up and manage users.

You are in control of user management within ASAPP. This includes inviting users, granting access to applications, and assigning specific permissions for features and tooling.

<Warning> Managing users for ASAPP dashboard is separate from the [Digital Agent Desk](/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/user-management)</Warning>

Manage users from within the ASAPP dashboard, including [inviting users](#invite-users), deleting users, and managing [application access and permissions](#application-access-and-permissions).

We also support [SSO](#sso), allowing you to manage user access via your own auth system.

## Invite Users

To Invite Users:

* Navigate to Home > Admin > User management
  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/getting-started/user-list.png" />
  </Frame>
* Click Invite Users
* Enter in the email and name for the user.
  * By default, users have the "Basic" role, but you may choose others. We will cover roles and permissions further below.
  * You may invite multiple users at once.
  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/getting-started/invite-user.png" />
  </Frame>

## Roles and Permissions

Access to ASAPP is managed via roles. A role is a collection of permissions which dictate what UI elements a user has access to.

By default, all users must have the Basic role, allowing them to log in to the dashboard. But you may create and assign as many roles as you like per given user.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/getting-started/role-list.png" />
</Frame>

### Creating a Role

To create a role:

1. Navigate to Home > Admin > Roles & Permissions.
2. Click "Create Role".
3. Enter a name and description for the role.
4. Select the permissions for the role.
5. Optionally, if you are using SSO, [add IDP mapping](#idp-mapping) to the role user.
6. Click "Save Permission".

### IDP Mapping

If you are using SSO, you can map roles in your Identity Provider (IDP) to the roles in ASAPP, allowing you to manage access to ASAPP via your own IDP.

You must work with your ASAPP account team to determine which claim from your IDP contains the roles list.

For each role in ASAPP, you specify one or more roles within your IDP that should be mapped to it. You can map multiple ASAPP roles to the same IDP role.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/getting-started/idp-mapping.png" />
</Frame>

## SSO

ASAPP supports Single Sign-On (SSO). SSO allows you to manage your team's access through an Identity Provider (IDP). ASAPP supports SSO using OpenID Connect and SAML.

When using SSO, your IDP manages the creation and authentication of user accounts, and determines which roles a user should have in ASAPP. You still need to manage the permissions for a given role within ASAPP via [IDP mapping](#idp-mapping).

If you are interested in using SSO, please reach out to your ASAPP account team to get set up.

### Chat Takeover

Administrators (managers or supervisors) can take over chats from agents or unassigned chats in the queue. This feature is useful for:

* Closing resolved chats that need disposition
* Handling complex or convoluted conversations
* Managing queue traffic during high-volume periods

To take over a chat:

1. Navigate to the conversation in Live Insights
2. Open the transcript area
3. Click the Takeover button in the upper left-hand corner
4. Confirm the takeover action

Once transferred, administrators can continue the chat through Agent Desk. Access to this functionality requires appropriate permissions set up by ASAPP.

# Agent SSO
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/agent-sso

Learn how to use Single Sign-On (SSO) to authenticate agents and admin users to the Digital Agent Desk.

ASAPP recommends for our customers to use SSO to authenticate agents and admin users to our applications.

In this scenario:

1. ASAPP is the Service Provider (SP) with the customer acting as the Identity Provider (IDP).
2. The customer's authentication system performs user authentication using their existing customer credentials.
3. ASAPP supports Service Provider Initiated SSO. Customers will provide the SSO URL to the agents and admins.
4. The URL points to the customer's SSO service, which will authenticate the users via their authentication system.
5. Once the user is authenticated, the customer's SSO service will send a SAML assertion, which includes some user information to ASAPP's SSO service.
6. ASAPP uses the information inside the SAML assertion to identify the user and redirect them to the appropriate application.

The diagram below illustrates the IDP-initiated SSO flow.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/AgentDeskSSO.png" />
</Frame>

## Configuring Single Sign-On via SAML

### Environments

ASAPP supports SSO in non-production and production environments. It is strongly recommended that customers configure SSO in both environments as well.

### Exchange of SAML metadata

Both ASAPP and the customer generate their respective SAML metadata and send the metadata files to one another. The metadata will be different for each environment, therefore they need to be generated once per environment.

Sample metadata file content:

```json
<EntityDescriptor xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata"
entityID="https://auth.asapp.com/auth/realms/hudson">
    <SPSSODescriptor AuthnRequestsSigned="false" WantAssertionsSigned="false"
        protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol
urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:protocol http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2003/07/secext">
    <KeyDescriptor use="encryption">
     <dsig:KeyInfo xmlns:dsig="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#">
      <dsig:KeyName>REDACTED</dsig:KeyName>
      <dsig:X509Data>
       <dsig:X509Certificate>REDACTED</dsig:X509Certificate>
      </dsig:X509Data>
     </dsig:KeyInfo>
    </KeyDescriptor>
 <SingleLogoutService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
Location="https://auth.asapp.com/auth/realms/hudson/broker/hudson-saml/endpoint"/>
 <NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:unspecified
 </NameIDFormat>
 <AssertionConsumerService
      Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
  Location="https://auth.asapp.com/auth/realms/hudson/broker/hudson-saml/endpoint/clients/asapp-saml"
        index="1" isDefault="true" />
     </SPSSODescriptor>
</EntityDescriptor>
```

### SAML Profile Configuration

Next, ASAPP and the customer configures their respective SSO service with each other's SAML profile. This can be achieved by importing the SAML metadata into the SSO service (if it supports a metadata import feature).

### SAML Attributes Configuration

SAML Attributes are key-value fields within the SAML message (also called SAML assertion) that is being sent from the Identity Provider (IDP) to the Service Provider (SP).

ASAPP requires the following fields to be included with the SAML assertion

| **Attribute Name** | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Example**                                 |
| :----------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| userId             | yes          | user's unique identifier used for authentication. Can be a unique readable value such as user's email or an opaque identifier such as a customer's internal user ID.                                                                   | [jdoe@company.com](mailto:jdoe@company.com) |
| firstName          | yes          | user's first name                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | John                                        |
| lastName           | yes          | user's last name                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Doe                                         |
| nameAlias          | yes          | user's display name. Allows an agent, based on their personal preference or company's privacy policy, to set an alias to show to the customers they are chatting with. If this is not sent then the agent firstName will be displayed. | John Doe                                    |
| roles              | yes          | the roles the user has within the ASAPP platform. Typically mapped to one or more AD Security Groups on the IDP.                                                                                                                       | representative\|manager                     |

The following fields are not **required** but **desired** to further automate the agent Desk configuration:

| **Attribute Name** | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                   | **Example**           |
| :----------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| groups             | no           | group(s) the user belongs to. This attribute controls the queue(s) that a user is assigned to. Not to be confused with the AD Security Groups (see the **roles** attribute above) | residential\|business |
| concurrency        | no           | number of concurrent chats the user can handle                                                                                                                                    | 5                     |

In addition, any custom fields can be configured in the SAML assertion. See the section below for more details.

### Sending User Data via SAML

ASAPP uses the SAML attribute fields to keep the user data up-to-date in our system. It also allows us to register a new user automatically when a new user logs into the ASAPP application for the first time.

In addition to the required fields that ASAPP needs to identify the user, customers can send additional fields in the SAML assertion that can be used for other purposes such as Reporting. An example can be the Agent Location. These fields are specific per customers. The name and possible values of these fields need to be agreed upon and configured prior to the SAML implementation.

### SSO Testing

SSO testing between the customer and ASAPP must be a coordinated effort due to the nature of the IDP-initiated SSO flow. The customer must provide several user accounts to be used for testing. Generally, the test scenarios are as follows:

1. An agent logs in for the first time. ASAPP observes that a new user record is created and the agent lands on the correct ASAPP application for their role (Desk for a rep, Admin for supervisor/manager).
2. The same agent logs out and logs back in. The agent observes that the correct application still opens.
3. Repeat the same test for another user account, ideally with different roles.

Once testing is completed successfully, then the SSO flow is certified for that environment.

Setting up SSO in the Production environment should follow the same steps.


# API Integration
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/api-integration

Learn how to connect the Digital Agent Desk to your backend systems.

ASAPP integrates with Your APIs to provide customers and agents with a more rich and personalized interaction.

ASAPP accomplishes this by making backend calls to Customer APIs in real time, providing customers with the latest up-to-date information.

This involves customers exposing the relevant APIs, securely, for ASAPP to make server to server calls.

## Authentication

Customers should wrap their APIs with secure authentication mechanisms, mainly addressing Customer Authentication and API Authentication.

### API Authentication on behalf of the User

ASAPP leverages our customers existing mechanisms of authenticating their customers, which ideally are the same across different channels.

Any identifier issued should have an expiration that is short, but should also allow for a good user experience without the customer having to authenticate multiple times over a session.

* **Cookie-based Authentication**: This is the traditional way where a user posts login credentials to the customer's server and receives a signed cookie, which is stored on the server and a copy on the browser, and will be used in subsequent interactions for the duration of the session. However, where possible a token-based approach is typically preferred.
* **Token-based Authentication:** In this mechanism a user posts login credentials to the customer's server and is issued a signed JSON Web Token (JWT). This token is not stored on the server making all interactions fully stateless. All requests from the client will include the JWT, which only the server can decode to authenticate every request. For more information on generating and signing JSON Web Tokens, please refer to [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/).

**API Endpoint**: `POST /customer_authenticate`

**Request**

```json
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/auth/customer_authenticate \
-H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
-d 'username=<username>&password=<password>'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "issued_at" : "1570733606449",
  "JWT" : "<JWT>",
  "expires_in" : "28799"
}
```

<Note>
  ASAPP requires direct access to the "customer\_authenticate" API to retrieve JWTs/cookies programmatically for testing.
</Note>

#### Communicating Customer Identifier with ASAPP

The customer may wish to implement any mechanism to authenticate their customers, as long as they can pass the identifier (cookie, JWT etc.) to ASAPP. The methods of passing this value to ASAPP depend on the chat channel used, either for [Web](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-authentication), [iOS](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/user-authentication), and [Android](/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/user-authentication).

#### Customer Identifier Requirements

ASAPP uses this customer identifier as a pass through value, either by including it as an HTTP Header or in the Body, when requesting customer data from the backend APIs. Since the Customer Identifier is the only piece of data ASAPP uses to identify users, it should adhere to the following:

* **Unique**: ASAPP will associate every customer chat with this id allowing ASAPP to tie chats from different channels into one single conversation. It is imperative that the Customer Identifier be unique per customer.
* **Consistent**: The Customer Identifier should remain consistent so that even if the customer returns after a significant amount of time, we are able to identify the customer.
* **Opaque**: The Customer Identifier by itself should not contain any customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It should be hashed, encoded and/or encrypted so that when used by itself, it is of no value.

### API Authentication using System-level Credential

Customers may wish to secure backend APIs by restricting access for clients to specific resources for a limited amount of time.

You can implement this using various mechanisms like OAuth 2.0, API Keys, System Credentials etc. This section provides details about OAuth using a Client Credentials Grant, which works well for server to server communication.

#### Client Credentials Grant

In this mechanism, the client sends a HTTP POST request with the following parameters in return for an access\_token.

* **grant\_type**
* **client\_id**
* **client\_secret**

**API Endpoint**: `POST /access_token`

**Request**

```json
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/oauth/access_token?grant_type=client_credentials 
\
-H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
-H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "token_type" : "Bearer",
  "issued_at" : "1570733606449",
  "client_id" : “<client_id>”,
  "access_token" : "<access_token>",
  "scope" : "client_credentials",
  "expires_in" : "28799"
}
```

### API Authorization

The customer may also want to use API keys to provide authorization to specific APIs. API keys are also passed in the HTTP header along with the authentication token.

**API Endpoint:** POST /getprofile

**Request**

```json
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/account/getprofile
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
-H 'customer-auth: JWT <JWT>' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'api-key: <api_key>' \
```

# Knowledge Base
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/knowledge-base

Learn how to integrate your Knowledge Base with the Digital Agent Desk.

Knowledge Base (KB) is a technology used to store structured and unstructured information useful for Agents to reference while servicing Customer enquiries.

You can integrate KB data into ASAPP Desk by manually uploading articles in an offline process or by integrating with a digital system which exposes the content via REST APIs.

Knowledge Base helps Agents access information without the Agent needing to navigate any external systems by surfacing KB content directly within Agent Desk's Right Hand Panel view.

This helps lower the Average Handle Time and increases Concurrency. KB also learns from Agent interactions and suggests articles and helps in Agent Augmentation.

</Frame>

## Integration

ASAPP can integrate with customer Knowledge Base systems or CRMs to pull data and make it available to Agent Desk. This is accomplished by a dedicated service, which can consume data from external systems that support standard REST APIs. The service layer is flexible enough to integrate with various industry standard Knowledge Base systems as well as in-house developed proprietary ones. The service programmatically retrieves new and updated articles on a regular basis to surface fresh and accurate content to agents in real-time.

Data pulled from external systems is transformed into ASAPP's standard format, and securely stored in S3 and in a database. Refer to the [Data Storage](#data-storage) section below for more details.

### Configuration

The service that integrates with customers is configuration driven so it can interface with different systems supporting different data formats/structures.

ASAPP requires the following information to integrate with APIs:

* REST endpoints and API definitions, data schemas and SLAs
  * URLs, Connection info, and Test Accounts for each environment
  * Authentication and Authorization requirements
  * JSON schema defining requests and responses, preferably Swagger
  * API Host that can handle HTTPS/TLS traffic
  * Resource
  * HTTP Method(s) supported
  * Content Type(s) supported and other Request Headers
  * Error handling documentation
  * Response sizes to expect
  * API Call Rate limits, if any
  * Response time SLAs
* API Response Requirements
  * Every 'article' should contain at least a unique identifier and last updated date timestamp.
  * Hierarchical data needs to clearly define the parent-child relationships
  * Content should not contain any PII/PCI related information
* Refreshing Data
  * On a set cadence as determined and agreed upon by both parties
* Size of data to help in capacity planning and scaling

## Data Storage

Once the service receives KB content, it stores the data in a secure S3 bucket that serves as the source of truth for all Knowledge Base articles. It then structures and packages the data into standard Knowledge Base types: Category, Folder and Article. The service then cleans, processes, and stores the packaged data in a database for further usage.

## Data Processing

ASAPP runs all the Knowledge Base articles stored in the database through a Knowledge Base Ranker service, which ranks articles and feeds Agent Augmentation. Given a set of user utterances, KB Ranker service assigns a score to every article of the Knowledge Base based on how relevant those articles are for that agent at that moment in the conversation. ASAPP determines relevance by taking into account the frequency of words in an article within the corpus of articles, and words of a given subset of utterances.

## Data Refresh

ASAPP can refresh data periodically and schedule it to meet customer needs. ASAPP uses a Unix cron style scheduler to run the refresh job, which allows flexible configuration.

Data Refresh replaces all of the current folders/articles with the new ones received.The refresh does not affect the ranking of articles, as their state is maintained separately.


# Queues and Routing
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/queues-and-routing

Learn how to manage conversation queues and agent routing in the Digital Agent Desk.

Digital Agent Desk routes customer conversations to the most appropriate agents through a structured workflow:

1. A customer initiates a conversation
2. The system labels the conversation with an Intent
3. Queue Routing evaluates the Intent and additional criteria to select the appropriate Queue
4. The Queue assigns the conversation to an available agent from its associated agent group

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/routing.png" alt="Issue Routing" />
</Frame>

Work with your ASAPP account team to configure intents, queues, and routing logic that align with your business needs.

## Managing Intents and Queues

An **Intent** classifies each customer conversation (Issue) and serves as the primary method of categorization. ASAPP analyzes conversation data and business requirements to determine the set of available Intents.

During runtime, Machine Learning (ML) models automatically assign the most appropriate Intent to each new Issue.

**Queue Routing** uses these Intents along with other defined criteria to direct conversations to specific Queues (Referred to as [Attributes Based Routing](/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/queues-and-routing/attributes-based-routing)). Each **Queue** represents a group of agents qualified to handle particular types of Issues.

<Note>
  ASAPP manages the configuration and maintenance of Intents and Queue Routing. Work with your ASAPP account team to optimize these settings for your business needs.
</Note>

## Optimizing Agent Concurrency

Concurrency controls how many simultaneous conversations each agent manages. Setting appropriate concurrency levels helps balance customer experience with agent workload.

Each agent has an individual concurrency level setting that determines their maximum number of concurrent conversations.

Digital Agent Desk provides several tools to help manage agent workloads:

* [High Effort Issues](#high-effort-issues) - Automatically identifies complex conversations that require more agent attention
* [Flexible Concurrency](#flexible-concurrency) - Dynamically adjusts capacity during natural conversation lulls

### High Effort Issues

By default, each conversation occupies one concurrency slot. However, certain conversations may require more time and attention from agents due to their complexity or scope.

Digital Agent Desk can automatically identify high effort Issues and assign them multiple concurrency slots based on the Intent and other attributes.

For example, a technical troubleshooting conversation might count as two slots, while a simple account update remains one slot. This intelligent slot allocation helps:

* Ensure agents have adequate time for complex customer needs
* Maintain balanced workloads across your team
* Improve customer satisfaction on challenging issues

Work with your ASAPP account team to configure complexity rules that align with your specific business scenarios and agent capabilities.

#### Monitoring High Effort Issues

The Real Time Dashboard displays agents handling high effort issues with a "high effort" icon. Select any agent's name to view their current conversation assignments.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/high-effort-dashboard.png" alt="High effort dashboard" />
</Frame>

### Flexible Concurrency

Flexible Concurrency maximizes agent productivity by temporarily increasing their conversation capacity during natural downtimes, such as:

* When conversations enter auto-pilot timeout (a period of customer inactivity)
* While agents complete disposition tasks

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/flex-concurrency.png" alt="Flex concurrency" />
</Frame>

Configure Flexible Concurrency settings per queue to match different conversation types and agent capabilities.

#### Protecting Agents with Flex Protect

During auto-pilot timeout, the system assumes a conversation is temporarily inactive due to customer inactivity. However, customers may return and resume their conversation at any point during this timeout period. Without protection, this can create a challenging situation where an agent who received a new flexible assignment suddenly needs to handle both the returning customer and their new conversation simultaneously.

Flex Protect prevents this type of overload by:

* Assigning a protected status to the agent
* Providing a configurable rest period where no new flexible assignments are allowed for that agent

<Note>
  We recommend enabling Flex Protect as agents may avoid using auto-pilot timeout if they fear being overloaded, leading to longer handle times.
</Note>

# Attributes Based Routing
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/queues-and-routing/attributes-based-routing

Learn how to use Attributes Based Routing (ABR) to route chats to the appropriate Agent Queue.

Attributes Based Routing (ABR) is a rules-based system to determine which Agent Queue an incoming chat should be assigned to.

ASAPP invokes ABR by default after our Machine Learning model classifies a customer's utterances to an Intent and determines that the Intent cannot be serviced by an automated flow.

## Attributes of ABR

Attributes can be any piece of information that customers can pass to ASAPP using the integrated SDKs.

ASAPP natively defines the standard attributes below:

* Intent - This is a code determined by running customer utterances through various different ML models.
  Ex: ACCTINFO, BILLING
* Web URL - This is the webpage that invoked the SDK. You can use any part of the URL as a value to route on.
  Ex: [www.customer.com/consumer/support](http://www.customer.com/consumer/support), [www.customer.com/business/sales](http://www.customer.com/business/sales)
* Channel - This is the channel the chat originated from.
  Ex: Web, iOS

The ASAPP SDK defines additional parameters, which can also be used in ABR. You can define these parameters as part of the ContextProvider.

* Company Subdivision
  Ex: divisionId1, subDivisionId2
* Segments
  Ex: NorthEast, USA, EMEA

You can also define custom customer specific attributes to be used in routing. Customer Information allows definition of any number of attributes as key-value pairs, which can be set per chat and be used for routing to specific agent queues. Please refer to the Customer Information section for more details on how to define custom attributes.

## Configuration

ABR is capable of using any or all of the above attributes to determine which queue to route a chat. The configuration is extremely flexible and can accommodate various complex rules including regular expression matches, as well as multi value matches.

Contact your Implementation Manager to model the routing rules.

## Template for Submitting Rules

Customers can create an Excel document with a sheet for each attribute they would like to define. The sheet name should be the name of the attribute and have two columns, one defining all the possible attribute values and the other column containing the name of the queue to be routed to.

If you are going to use multiple attributes in any different combinations, then you should define these conditions in a separate sheet, dedicating a row for every unique combination.

ASAPP will assume that Excel attribute names that do not follow the ASAPP standard are custom defined and passed in 'Customer Information'.

See the [User Management](/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/user-management) section for more information.

## Queue Management

You can define Queues based on business or technical needs. You can define any number of queues and can follow any desired naming convention. You can apply Business Hours to queues individually. For more information on other features and functionality, please contact your Implementation Manager.

You can assign Agents to one or more queues based on skills and/or requirements. Please refer to [User Management](/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/user-management) for more details.


# User Management
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/digital-agent-desk/user-management

Learn how to manage users and roles in the Digital Agent Desk.

You control the User Management (Roles and Permissions) within the Digital Agent Desk.

These roles dictate if a user can authenticate to *Agent Desk*, *Admin Dashboard*, or both. In addition, roles determine what view and data users see in the Admin Dashboard. You can pass User Data to ASAPP via *SSO*, AD/LDAP, or other approved integration.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-6f3c5891-ad4d-bf0b-06f3-31d6bf3b96ac.png" />

## Grouping and Data Filtering via SSO

You can use attributes from your SSO/SAML configuration to control what chats and metrics users see within Live Insights, Conversation Manager, and User Management. This ensures users only see information relevant to their role and responsibilities.

These attributes create a hierarchical structure where:

* BPOs only see their service chats
* Workforce Management users see all chats and metrics for their BPO
* Agents see only their own chats and data
* Managers see chats for their assigned teams

To use this grouping, you need to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define attribute group mapping">
    Define groups using the following attributes:

    * BPO
    * Product
    * Role
    * Location

    Make sure to define a name for each group.

    Reach out to your ASAPP account team with the groups you define. ASAPP will implement the groups for you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send attributes to ASAPP">
    Ensure that your SSO/SAML System sends the necessary attributes to ASAPP.

    You can reach out to your ASAPP account team with any questions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use groups for filtering and queue association">
    Within Live Insights, Conversation Manager, and User Management, you can map the groups you defined to filters and queues. The groups will be applied to filter data and control access based on your defined mappings.
  </Step>

# Alerts, Signals & Mitigation
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/insights-manager/live-insights/alerts,-signals---mitigation

Use alerts, signals, and mitigation measures to improve agent task efficiency.

To improve user focus and task efficiency, ASAPP elevates various alerts and signals within Live Insights.

These alerts notify users when performance is degrading, when events are detected, or when high queue mitigation measures can be activated based on volume.

## Type of Alerts

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/insights-manager/alert-types.png" />
</Frame>

Live Insights displays four alert types:

1. **Metric Highlighting**: Highlights metrics that are above their target threshold within Live Insights. You can see the highlights on the Overview page, as well as within single queues and queue groups. The alert will persist until the metric's performance returns below its threshold.
2. **Event-based Alerts**: Detects and records events per conversation and displays them in the conversation activity table.
3. **High Queue Mitigation**: Activates when the queue volume exceeds the target threshold. When active, you can use mitigation measures to reduce queue volume impacts.
4. **High Effort Issue**: Indicates when a high effort issue is awaiting assignment and is currently blocking other issues from being assigned.

## Metric Highlighting

Live Insights highlights metrics that are above their target threshold on the Overview page, as well as within single queues and queue groups.

The alert persists until the metric's performance returns below its threshold.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/insights-manager/metric-highlight.png" />
</Frame>

Where metrics are highlighted:

1. **Conversation performance**: You can highlight both 'average handle time' and 'average response time'.
2. **Agent performance**: 'Time in status', 'average handle time', and 'average response time'.
3. **Queue performance**: You can highlight queue-level metrics within a single queue, queue groups, or on the Overview page.

## Event-based Alerts

Events are generated from actions taken by agents, customers or you.

Live Insights detects and records these events and displays them alongside conversation data, within the 'alert' column.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/insights-manager/event-based-alerts.png" />
</Frame>

1. **Conversation events**: These events are related to a unique conversation. The events can be generated from agent actions or your actions.
   * **Customer transfers**: When an agent transfers a customer, Live Insights displays an alert next to the conversation.
   * **Whisper sent**: When you send a whisper message to an agent, Live Insights records and displays the event next to the conversation.
2. **Agent events**: These events impact the agent workload and help you contextualize agent performance. Live Insights displays the events for all targeted agents, within the Agent Performance panel.
   * **High effort**: Agents that are currently handling a high effort issue.
   * **Flex concurrency**: The agent is currently flexed and has a higher than normal utilization.

## High Queue Mitigation

ASAPP provides tools to enable workforce management groups to act fast when queues are or could be anomalously high.

**Tools Overview**

Live Insights can:

* Monitor queue volume for unusually high volume.
* Highlight 'Queued' metric based on severity level.
* Activate 'Custom High Wait Time' messaging and replace Estimated Wait Time messaging.
* Pause queues experiencing extremely high volume and prevent new queue assignments.

**Volume Thresholds:**

Live Insights highlights metrics when they reach past a threshold defined for the queue.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/insights-manager/high-queue-mitigation-severity.png" />
</Frame>

1. **Low Severity:** detects abnormal activity and has moderate impact on the queue.
2. **High Severity**: detects highly abnormal activity. The queue is severely impacted.

**Mitigation Options:**

## High Effort Issues

ASAPP supports a capability to enable agent focus for higher effort issues, while maintaining efficiency.

This feature dynamically adjusts how many concurrent issues an agent should handle while assigned a high effort issue.

### What is a High Effort Issue

ASAPP will route customers based on the expected effort of their issue. All issues, by default, will have an effort of 1.

Any issue with an effort value greater than 1 will be considered "high effort". Reach out to your ASAPP Implementation team to configure high effort rules for your program.

## Feature Definition

* **Slot**: A slot represents a space for a chat to be assigned to an agent. You can assign and configure multiple slots to a single agent via User Management.
* **Effort**: Effort represents what is needed from an agent to solve an issue. For each effort point assigned to an issue, an agent must have an equivalent number of available slots to be assigned that issue. ASAPP determines an issue's effort by its relevant customer attributes.
* **High Effort Time Threshold**: A threshold that sets how much time an agent can parallelize a high effort issue with other issues. You can configure this threshold per queue. This threshold represents the duration of all existing assignments an agent is handling when a high effort issue is next in line.
* **Flex Slot**: All agents have 1 additional slot that can be used if they are eligible to receive a flex assignment or if they are temporarily over-effort when handling a high effort issue.
* **Linear Utilization Level:** A type of Linear Utilization relative to the number of assignments an agent has assigned at a given time, regardless of the assignment workload state.
* **Assignment Workload**: A measure of Linear Workload relative to the number of active assignments an agent has assigned at a given time. An assignment is not considered active if it has caused an agent to become Flex Eligible.
* **Effort Workload**: A measure of Linear Workload relative to the issue effort of all active assignments an agent has assigned at a given time.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-d9e0c484-6703-5c97-858a-13055e603ff6.png" />
</Frame>

### How are high effort issues prioritized and assigned?

ASAPP assigns high effort chats in the order that they entered the queue. You can prioritize high effort chats higher in the queue using customer attributes. This prioritization is optional and not required. A configurable *high effort time threshold* allows each queue to set how much time an agent can parallelize a high effort issue with other assignments.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-aea93058-21b5-38be-9a3c-5cb4dc3871cd.png" />
</Frame>

### How are high effort issues assigned against other issues?

ASAPP assigns high effort issues in order of configured priority and when they entered the queue. An agent will receive a high effort assignment if they meet at least 1 of the following criteria:

* An agent has 0 active assignments.
* An agent has sufficient open slots to receive a high effort assignment.
* The **high effort time threshold** has elapsed for all of an agent's current assignments and the high effort chat's effort would not extend the agent's Effort Workload past their Flex Slot.

### How do high effort issues impact performance?

* High effort issues will not change current behavior for Queue Priority.
* High effort issues will not change current behavior for Flex Eligibility or Flex Protect.
* High effort issues take longer to assign because they have to wait for an agent to have sufficient effort capacity.
* If a set of queues has 50% or more agents in common, then a high effort issue at the front of one queue will hold the issues in the other "shared" queues until it is assigned.

### How do I monitor the impact of high effort issues?

You can view the 'Queued - High Effort' metric in Live Insights on queue detail pages. This metric captures the number of high effort issues currently waiting in the queue. If a high effort issue is first in queue and slows other issues from being assigned, Live Insights displays an alert on this metric. These changes will also be visible for programs that do not have high effort rules configured.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/insights-manager/high-effort-states.png" />
</Frame>

### How can I tell which agents are handling high effort issues?

In the Agent Right Rail, you can monitor which agents are currently handling high effort issues. ASAPP displays an icon next to the agent's utilization indicating a high effort issue is assigned. These changes will also be visible for programs that do not have high effort rules configured.

## Teams and Locations

You can track the live behaviors of agents by overseeing outages and staff levels at different geographic locations. Furthermore, each team provides hourly updates as to who is active/lunch etc and they want to be able to get this information easily.

Admins see a list of agents when they click into a particular queue and select Performance from the left-hand panel and clicked into the Agents icon on the right-hand panel. Admins can further oversee results by performance metrics of the current day and filter both the agent list and metrics by any of the following attributes:

* **Agent Name**
* **Location**
* **Team**
* **Status**

### Team Table

Admins can filter teams by type of role and review each company assigned to the team. Also, each result shows the size and the occupancy of each team.

Each administrator can provide an hourly update of how many agents are active, on lunch, or in a different state as well as view corresponding metrics.

## Overflow Queue Routing

Overflow Queue Routing enables administrators to redirect traffic from one queue to another to reduce estimated wait times for end-customers and support closed queues when it is a legal requirement.

Overflow Queue Routing can use two rules:

1. **Business Hours Rule**: Traffic from Queue A is redirected to Queue B when it is outside the operating business hours for Queue B.
2. **Agent Availability Rule**: Traffic from Queue A is redirected to Queue B when there are no available agents serving Queue A.

<Note>
  Work with your ASAPP account team to configure overflow routing rules that align with your business needs.
</Note>

## Bulk Close and Transfer Chats

ASAPP provides capabilities to bulk close and transfer chats in Live Insights to help manage queues experiencing unusual activity or high traffic.

### Bulk Chat Transfer

To transfer all chats from one queue to another:

1. Click the dropdown menu in the queue card
2. Select "Transfer all chats"
3. A queue selection modal appears asking "Select the queue which you want to transfer all chats to?"
4. Select the target queue from the dropdown list
5. Click "Transfer chats" to complete the action

A toast message will confirm that all chats have been transferred. The end customer will not see any change on their side and will assume they are still waiting in a queue.

### Bulk Chat Closure

To close all chats in a queue:

1. Click the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner of the queue card
2. Select "End all chats" from the dropdown menu
3. A confirmation modal appears asking "Are you sure you want to end all chats in this queue?"
4. Click "Confirm" or "Yes" to complete the action

<Note>
  Use these features carefully as they affect multiple customer conversations simultaneously. Bulk actions are best used in situations where immediate intervention is needed to manage queue performance or address unusual activity.
</Note>

# Android SDK Overview
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk

Learn how to integrate the ASAPP Android SDK into your application.

You can integrate ASAPP's Android SDK into your application to provide a seamless messaging experience for your Android customers.

### Android Requirements

ASAPP supports Android 5.0 (API level 21) and up. The SDK currently targets API level 30.

ASAPP distributes the library via a Maven repository and you can import it with Gradle. ASAPP wrote the SDK in Kotlin. You can also use it if you developed your application in Java.

## Getting Started

To get started with Android SDK, you need to:

1. [Gather Required Information](#1-gather-required-information "1. Gather Required Information")
2. [Install the SDK](#2-install-the-sdk "2. Install the SDK")
3. [Configure the SDK](#3-configure-the-sdk "3. Configure the SDK")
4. [Open Chat](#4-open-chat "4. Open Chat")

### 1. Gather Required Information

Before downloading and installing the SDK, please make sure you have the following information. Contact your Implementation Manager at ASAPP if you have any questions.

|                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App ID               | Also known as the "Company Marker", assigned by ASAPP.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| API Host Name        | The fully-qualified domain name used by the SDK to communicate with ASAPP's API. Provided by ASAPP and subject to change based on the stage of implementation.                                                                         |
| Region Code          | The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the region of the implementation, provided by ASAPP.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Supported Languages  | Your app's supported languages, in order of preference, as an array of language tag strings. Strings can be in the format "\{ISO 639-1 Code}-\{ISO 3166-1 Code}" or "\{ISO 639-1 Code}", such as "en-us" or "en". Defaults to \["en"]. |
| Client Secret        | This can be an empty or random string\* until otherwise notified by ASAPP.                                                                                                                                                             |
| User Identifier      | A username or similar value used to identify and authenticate the customer, provided by the Customer Company.                                                                                                                          |
| Authentication Token | A password-equivalent value, which may or may not expire, used to authenticate the customer that is provided by the Customer Company.                                                                                                  |

\* In the future, the ASAPP-provided client secret will be a string that authorizes the integrated SDK to call the ASAPP API in production. ASAPP recommends fetching this string from a server and storing it securely using Secure Storage; however, as it is one of many layers of security, you can hard-code the client secret.

### 2. Install the SDK

ASAPP distributes the library via a Maven repository and you can import it with Gradle. First, add the ASAPP Maven repository to the top-level `build.gradle` file of your project:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "https://packages.asapp.com/chat/sdk/android"
    }
}
```

Then, add the SDK to your application dependencies:

`implementation 'com.asapp.chatsdk:chat-sdk:<version>'`

Please check the latest Chat SDK version in the [repository](https://gitlab.com/asappinc/public/mobile-sdk/android/-/packages) or [release notes](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/android/releasenotes/).

At this point, sync and rebuild your project to make sure all dependencies are imported successfully. You can also validate the authenticity of the downloaded dependency by following these steps.

### Validate Android SDK Authenticity

You can verify the authenticity of the SDK and make sure that ASAPP generated the binary. The GPG signature is the standard way ASAPP handles Java binaries when this is a requirement.

#### Setup

First, download the ASAPP public key [from here](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/android/security/asapp_public.gpg).

```json
wget -O asapp_public_key.asc https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/android/security/asapp_public.gpg
```

#### Verify File Signature

Use the console GPG command to import the key:

```json
gpg --import asapp_public_key.asc
```

You can verify that the public key was imported via `gpg --list-keys`.

Download the ASC file directly from [our repository](https://gitlab.com/asappinc/public/mobile-sdk/android/-/packages). Finally, you can verify the Chat SDK AAR and associated ASC files like so:

```json
gpg --verify chat-sdk-<version>.aar.asc chat-sdk-<version>.aar
```

### 3. Configure the SDK

Use the code below to create a configuration, and initialize the SDK with it. You must pass your `Application` instance.

Refer to the aforementioned [required information](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/ios-quick-start). ASAPP recommends you initialize the SDK in your `Application.onCreate`.

```json
import com.asapp.chatsdk.ASAPP
import com.asapp.chatsdk.ASAPPConfig
val asappConfig = ASAPPConfig(
   appId = "my-app-id",
   apiHostName = "my-hostname.test.asapp.com",
   clientSecret = "my-secret")
ASAPP.init(application = this, config = asappConfig)
```

<Note>
  The SDK should only be initialized once and it is possible to update the configuration at runtime.
</Note>

### 4. Open Chat

Once the SDK has been configured and initialized, you can open chat. To do so, use the `openChat(context: Context)` function which will start a new Activity:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.openChat(context = this)
```

Once the chat interface is open, you should see an initial state similar to the one below:

# Customization
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/customization



## Styling

The SDK uses color attributes defined in the ASAPP theme, as well as extra style configuration options set via the style configuration class.

### Themes

To customize the SDK theme, extend the default ASAPP theme in your `styles.xml` file:

```xml
<style name="ASAPPTheme.Chat">
   <item name="asapp_primary">@color/custom_asapp_primary</item>
</style>
```

<Note>
  You must define your color variants for day and night in the appropriate resource files, unless night mode is disabled in your application.
</Note>

ASAPP recommends starting by only customizing `asapp_primary` to be your brand's primary color, and adjusting other colors when necessary for accessibility. `asapp_primary` is used as the message bubble background in most buttons and other controls. The screenshot below shows the default theme (gray primary - center) and custom primary colors on the left and right.

There are two other colors you may consider customizing for accessibility or to achieve an exact match with your app's theme: `asapp_on_background` and `asapp_on_primary`. `asapp_on_background` is used by other elements that might appear in front of the background. `asapp_on_primary` is used for text and other elements that appear in front of the primary color.

### More Colors

Besides the colors used for [themes](#themes "Themes"), you can override specific colors in a number of categories: the toolbar, chat content, messages, and other elements. You can override all properties mentioned below in the `ASAPPTheme.Chat` style.

The status bar color is `asapp_status_bar` and toolbar colors are `asapp_toolbar` (background), `asapp_nav_button`, `asapp_nav_icon`, and `asapp_nav_text` (foreground).

</Frame>

### Text and Buttons

To customize fonts and colors for both text and buttons, use the `ASAPPCustomTextStyleHandler`. To set this optional handler use `ASAPPStyleConfig.setTextStyleHandler`. Use the given `ASAPPTextStyles`

object to:

* Set a new font family with `updateFonts`. If no new fonts are set, the system default will be used instead.
* Override font sizes, letter spacing, text colors, and text casing styles. You can also customize the font family for each text style individually, if needed.
* Override button colors for normal, highlighted and disabled states.

Example:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.getStyleConfig()
   .setTextStyleHandler { context, textStyles ->
       val regular = Typeface.createFromAsset(context.assets, "fonts/NH-Regular.ttf")
       val medium = Typeface.createFromAsset(context.assets, "fonts/Lato-Bold.ttf")
       val black = Typeface.createFromAsset(context.assets, "fonts/Lato-Black.ttf")
       textStyles.updateFonts(regular, medium, black)
       textStyles.body.fontSize = 14f
       val textHighlightColor = ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.my_text_hightlight_color)
       textStyles.primaryButton.textHighlighted = textHighlightColor
   }
```

See `ASAPPTextStyles` to see all overridable styles.

<Note>
  `setTextStyleHandler` is called when an ASAPP activity is created. Use the given `Context` object if you access resources to make sure that all customization uses correct resource qualifiers.

  For example: if a user is in chat and toggles Night Mode, the SDK automatically triggers an activity restart. Once the new activity is created, the SDK calls `setTextStyleHandler` with the new night/day context, which will retrieve the correct color variants from your styles.
</Note>

### Atomic Customization

To customize the styles at an atomic level, you can use the following method. Customizing at the atomic level will **override any default style** that is being set on the UI views. Use it only if general styling is not sufficient, and you need further customization. This is optional, and in most cases, you won't need it. Use with caution.

Example:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.getStyleConfig()
    .setAtomicViewStyleHandler { context: Context, viewStyles: ASAPPCustomViewStyles ->
        // Update viewStyles as needed
    }
```

## Chat Header

The chat header (toolbar in the chat activity) has no content by default, but you can can add text or icon using `ASAPPStyleConfig`.

### Text Title

To add text to the chat header, pass a String resource to `setChatActivityTitle`. By default, the title will be aligned to start. For example:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.getStyleConfig()
    .setChatActivityTitle(R.string.asapp_chat_title)
```

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-b9d4fbc9-cc8a-9acf-070a-47b39d43905f.png" />
</Frame>

### Drawable Title

To add an icon to the chat header use: `setChatActivityToolbarLogo`. You can also center the header content by calling `setIsToolbarTitleOrIconCentered(true)`. For example:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.getStyleConfig
    .setChatActivityToolbarLogo(R.drawable.asapp_chat_icon)
    .setIsToolbarTitleOrIconCentered(true)
```

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-2f5e134a-27bf-81f4-9bf8-cd9c277e25d2.png" />
</Frame>

<Caution>
  Icons will have priority in the chat header. If you add both text and icon, only the icon will be used.
</Caution>

## Dark Mode

Android 10 (API 29) introduced Dark Mode (a.k.a night mode, dark theme), with a system UI toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark modes. ASAPP recommends reading the [developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme) for more information.

The ASAPP SDK theme defines default colors using the system resource "default" and "night" qualifiers, so chat will react to changes to the system night mode setting.

<Note>
  The ASAPP SDK does not automatically convert any color or image assets in Dark Mode, you must define night variants for each custom asset as described in [Android >Styling>Theming](#themes "Customization").
</Note>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-b890e869-884e-07ad-b0d9-a564b0550f47.png" />
</Frame>

### Disable or Force a Dark Mode Setting

To disable Dark Mode, or to force Dark Mode for Android API levels below 29, ASAPP recommends using the [AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/appcompat/app/AppCompatDelegate#setDefaultNightMode\(int\)) AndroidX API. This function changes the night mode setting throughout the entire application session, which also includes ASAPP SDK activities.

For example, it is possible to use Dark Mode on Android API 21 with the following:

```kotlin
AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode(AppCompatDelegate.MODE_NIGHT_YES)
```


# Deep Links and Web Links
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/deep-links-and-web-links



## Handling Deep Links in Chat

Certain chat flows may present buttons that are deep links to another part of your app. To react to taps on these buttons, implement the `ASAPPDeepLinkHandler` interface:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.deepLinkHandler = object : ASAPPDeepLinkHandler {
    override fun handleASAPPDeepLink(deepLink: String, data: JSONObject?, activity: Activity) {
        // Handle deep link.
    }
} 
```

ASAPP provides an `Activity` instance for convenience, in case you need to start a new activity. Please ask your Implementation Manager if you have questions regarding deep link names and data.

## Handling Web Links in Chat

Certain chat flows may present buttons that are web links. To react to taps on these buttons, implement the `ASAPPWebLinkHandler` interface:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.webLinkHandler = object : ASAPPWebLinkHandler {
    override fun handleASAPPWebLink(webLink: String, activity: Activity) {
        // Handle web link.
    }
}
```

<Note>
  If you don't implement the handler (see above), the ASAPP SDK will open the link utilizing the system default with `Intent.ACTION_VIEW`.
</Note>

## Implementing Deep Links into Chat

### Getting Started

Please see the Android documentation on [Handling Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links).

### Connecting the Pieces

Once you set up a custom URL scheme for your app and handle deep links into your application, you can start chat to pass any data payload extracted from the link:

```json
ASAPP.instance.openChat(context, asappIntent= mapOf("Code": "EXAMPLE_INTENT"))
```


# Miscellaneous APIs
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/miscellaneous-apis



## Conversation Status

To get the current `ASAPPConversationStatus`, implement the `conversationStatusHandler` callback:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.conversationStatusHandler = { conversationStatus ->
    // Handle conversationStatus.isLiveChat and conversationStatus.unreadMessages
}
```

* If `isLiveChat` is `true`, the customer is currently connected to a live support agent or in a queue.
* The `unreadMessages` integer indicates the number of new messages received since last entering Chat.

### Trigger the Conversation Status Handler

You can trigger this handler in two ways:

1. Manually trigger it with:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.fetchConversationStatus()
```

The Chat SDK will fetch the status asynchronously and callback to `conversationStatusHandler` once it is available.

2. The handler may be triggered when a push notification is received if the application is in the foreground. If your application handles Firebase push notifications, use:

```kotlin
class MyFirebaseMessagingService : FirebaseMessagingService() {
    override fun onMessageReceived(message: RemoteMessage) {
        super.onMessageReceived(message)
        val wasFromAsapp = ASAPP.instance.onFirebaseMessageReceived(message)
        // Additional handling...
    }
}
```

<Note>
  The Chat SDK only looks for conversation status data in the payload and doesn't cache or persist analytics. If the push notification was sent from ASAPP, the SDK returns true and triggers the `conversationStatusHandler` callback.
</Note>

## Debug Logs

By default, the SDK only prints error logs to the console output. To allow the SDK to log warnings and debug information, use `setDebugLoggingEnabled`.

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.setDebugLoggingEnabled(BuildConfig.DEBUG)
```

<Note>
  Disable debug logs for production use.
</Note>

## Clear the Persisted Session

To clear the ASAPP session persisted on disk:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.clearSession()
```

<Note>
  Only use this when an identified user signs out. Don't use for anonymous users, as it will cause chat history loss.
</Note>

## Setting an Intent

### Open Chat with an Initial Intent

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.openChat(context, asappIntent = mapOf("Code" to "EXAMPLE_INTENT"))
```

To set the intent while chat is open, use `ASAPP.instance.setASAPPIntent()`. Only call this if chat is already open. Use `ASAPP.instance.doesASAPPActivityExist` to verify if the user is in chat.

## Handling Chat Events

Implement the `ASAPPChatEventHandler` interface to react to specific chat events:

```kotlin
ASAPP.instance.chatEventHandler = object : ASAPPChatEventHandler {
    override fun handle(name: String, data: Map<String, Any>?) {
        // Handle chat event
    }
}
```

<Note>
  These events relate to user flows inside chat, not user behavior like button clicks.
</Note>

### Implement Chat end

To track the end of a chat, implement the following custom `CHAT_CLOSED` event

<Tip>
  In this example, the event message is set as `Chat is closed`. But you can name it as you wish.
</Tip>

```kotlin
chatEventHandler = object : ASAPPChatEventHandler {
                override fun handle(name: String, data: Map<String, Any>?) {
                    if (name == CustomEvent.CHAT_CLOSED.name) {
                        Toast.makeText(applicationContext,
                            "Chat is closed",
                            Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
                    }
                }
            }
```

<Note>
  Chat end implementation is available for the SDK version 10.3.1 and above.
</Note>


# Notifications
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/notifications



ASAPP provides the following notifications:

* [Push Notifications](#push-notifications "Push Notifications")
* [Persistent Notifications](#persistent-notifications "Persistent Notifications")

## Push Notifications

ASAPP's systems may trigger push notifications at certain times, such as when an agent sends a message to an end customer who does not currently have the chat interface open. In such scenarios, ASAPP calls your company's API with data that identifies the recipient's device, which triggers push notifications. ASAPP's servers do not communicate with Firebase directly.

ASAPP provides methods in the SDK to register and deregister the customer's device for push notifications.

For a deeper dive on how ASAPP and your company's API handle push notifications, please see our documentation on [Push Notifications and the Mobile SDKs](../push-notifications-and-the-mobile-sdks "Push Notifications and the Mobile SDKs").

In addition to this section, see Android's documentation about [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) and specifically how to setup [Android Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client).

### Enable Push Notifications

1. Identify which token you will use to send push notifications to the current user. This token is usually either the Firebase instance ID or an identifier generated by your company's API for this purpose.
2. Then, register the push notification token using:

   ```kotlin
   ASAPP.instance.updatePushNotificationsToken(newToken: String)
   ```

   In case you issue a new token to the current user, you also need to update it in the SDK.

### Disable Push Notifications

In case the user logs out of the application or other related scenarios, you can disable push notifications for the current user by calling:

`ASAPP.instance.disablePushNotifications().`

<Note>
  Call this function before you change `ASAPP.instance.user` (or clear the session) to prevent the customer from receiving unintended push notifications.
</Note>

### Handle Push Notifications

You can verify if ASAPP triggered a push notification and passed a data payload into the SDK.

<Note>
  Your application usually won't receive push notifications from ASAPP if the identified user for this device is connected to chat.
</Note>

For a deeper dive on how Android handles push notifications, please see the Firebase docs on [Receiving Messages in Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive).

#### Background Push Notifications

If your app receives a push notification while in the background or closed, the system will display the OS notification. Once the user taps the notification, the app starts with `Intent` data from that push notification.

To help differentiate notifications from ASAPP and others your app might receive, ASAPP recommends that the push notification has a `click_action` with the value `asapp.intent.action.OPEN_CHAT`. For more information on how to set a click action, please see the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref#notification-payload-support). With a click action set to the push notification, you will need to add a new intent filter to match it:

```xml
<activity android:name=".HomeActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="asapp.intent.action.OPEN_CHAT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Once you create the activity, check if it's an ASAPP notification, and then open chat with the data:

```kotlin
if (ASAPP.instance.shouldOpenChat(intent)) {
    ASAPP.instance.openChat(context = this, androidIntentExtras = intent.extras)
}
```

The helper function [`shouldOpenChat`](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/android/latest/chatsdk/com.asapp.chatsdk/-a-s-a-p-p/should-open-chat.html) simply checks if the intent action matches the recommended one, but its use is optional.

#### Foreground Push Notifications

When you receive Firebase push notifications while your app is in the foreground, it will call `FirebaseMessagingService.onMessageReceived`. Check if that notification is from ASAPP:

```kotlin
class MyFirebaseMessagingService : FirebaseMessagingService() {
    override fun onMessageReceived(message: RemoteMessage) {
        super.onMessageReceived(message)
        val wasFromAsapp = ASAPP.instance.onFirebaseMessageReceived(message)
        // ...
    }
}
```

For a good user experience, ASAPP recommends providing UI feedback to indicate there are new messages instead of opening chat right away. For example, update the unread message counter for your app's chat badge. You can retrieve that information from: `ASAPP.instance.conversationStatusHandler`.

## Persistent Notifications

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-e28f9066-d931-3745-9a1b-d2f2ff3703a6.png" />
</Frame>

The ASAPP Android SDK will automatically surface a persistent notification when a user joins a queue or is connected to a live agent (starting on v8.4.0). Tapping the notification triggers an intent that takes the user directly into ASAPP Chat. Once the live chat ends or the user leaves the queue, the notification is dismissed.

Persistent notifications are:

* ongoing, not dismissible [notifications](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification).
* low priority and do not vibrate or make sounds.
* managed directly by the SDK and do not require integration changes.

ASAPP enables this feature by default. To disable it, please reach out to your ASAPP Implementation Manager.

<Note>
  Persistent notifications are not push notifications, which are created and handled by your application.
</Note>

### Customize Persistent Notifications

#### Notification Title and Icon

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-4796925b-926a-e198-230a-a7aa157a3e21.png" />
</Frame>

To customize the title of persistent notifications, override the following string resource:

```json
<string name="asapp_persistent_notification_title">Chat for Customer Support</string>
```

And to customize the icon, create a new drawable resource with the following identifier (file name):

```json
drawable/asapp_ic_contact_support.xml
```

ASAPP recommends that you do not change the body of persistent notifications.

#### Notification Channel

By default, ASAPP sets the notification to [Notification Channel](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel) `asapp_chat`, but it is possible to customize the channel being used.

To customize the channel used by persistent notifications, override the following string resources:

```json
<string name="asapp_persistent_notification_channel_id">asapp_chat</string>
<string name="asapp_persistent_notification_channel_name">Chat for Customer Support</string>
```


# User Authentication
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/user-authentication



As in the Quick Start section, you can connect to chat as an anonymous user by not setting a user, or initializing an `ASAPPUser` with a null customer identifier. However, many chat use cases might require ASAPP to know the identity of the user.

To connect as an identified user, please specify a customer identifier string and a request context provider function. This provider will be called from a background thread, when the SDK makes requests that require customer authentication with your company's servers. The request context provider is a function that returns a map with keys and values agreed upon with ASAPP. Please ask your Implementation Manager if you have questions.

## Example:

```kotlin
val requestContextProvider = object : ASAPPRequestContextProvider {
    override fun getASAPPRequestContext(user: ASAPPUser,
                                        refreshContext:Boolean): Map<String, Any>? {
        return mapOf(
            "Auth" to mapOf(
                "Token" to "example-token"
            )
        )
    }
}
ASAPP.instance.user = ASAPPUser("testuser@example.com", requestContextProvider)
```

## Handle Login Buttons

If you connect to chat anonymously, you may be asked to log in when necessary by being shown a message button:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-bbfa4b7a-ca23-7407-c592-a8d5df402b5c.png" />
</Frame>

If you then tap the **Sign In** button, the SDK will use the `ASAPPUserLoginHandler` to call to the application. Due to the asynchronous nature of this flow, your application should use the activity lifecycle to provide a result to the SDK.

How to Implement the Sign In Flow

1. Implement the `ASAPPUserLoginHandler` and start your application's `LoginActivity`, including the given request code.
   ```kotlin
   ASAPP.instance.userLoginHandler = object: ASAPPUserLoginHandler {
       override fun loginASAPPUser(requestCode: Int, activity: Activity) {
           val loginIntent = new Intent(activity, LoginActivity::class.java)
           activity.startActivityForResult(loginIntent, requestCode)
       }
   }
   ```
2. If a user successfully signs into your application, update the user instance and then finish your `LoginActivity` with `Activity.RESULT_OK`.
   ```kotlin
   ASAPP.instance.user = ASAPPUser(userIdentifier, contextProvider) 
   setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK)
   finish()
   ```
3. In case a user cancels the operation, finish your `LoginActivity` with `Activity.RESULT_CANCELED`.
   ```kotlin
   setResult(Activity.RESULT_CANCELED)
   finish()
   ```

After your `LoginActivity` finishes, the SDK will capture the result and resume the chat conversation.

## Token Expiration and Refreshing the Context

If the provided token has expired, the SDK will call the [ASAPPRequestContextProvider](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/android/latest/chatsdk/com.asapp.chatsdk/-a-s-a-p-p-request-context-provider) with an `refreshContext` parameter set to `true` indicating that the context must be refreshed. In that case, please make sure to return a map with fresh credentials that can be used to authenticate the user. In case an API call is required to refresh the credentials, make sure to block the calling thread until the updated context can be returned.


# Apple Messages for Business
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/apple-messages-for-business



Apple Messages for Business is a service that enables your organization to communicate directly with your customers through your Customer Service Platform (CSP), which in this case will be ASAPP, using the Apple Messages for Business app.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-a8feefc5-c783-d2ae-5698-5d3058141af9.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  All third party specifications are subject to change by Apple. As such, this section may become out-of-date. ASAPP will always attempt to use the most up-to-date third-party documentation. If you come across any errors or out-of-date content, please contact your ASAPP representative.
</Note>

## Quick Start Guide

1. Register for an Apple Messages for Business account
2. Specify Entry Points
3. Complete User Experience Review
4. Determine Launch & Throttling Strategy

### Register for an Apple Messages for Business Account

Before integrating with ASAPP's Apple Messages for Business adapter, you must register an account with Apple. See [Apple Messages for Business Getting Started](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/messaging-documentation/register-your-acct#getting-started) documentation for more details.

### Specify Entry Points

Entry points are where your customers start conversations with your business. You can select from Apple and ASAPP entry points.

#### Apple Entry Points

Apple supports multiple entry points for customers to engage using the Messages app. See [Apple Messages for Business Entry Points](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/messaging-documentation/customer-journey#entry-points) documentation for more information.

#### ASAPP Entry Point

ASAPP supports the Chat Instead entry point. See the [Chat Instead](/messaging-platform/integrations/chat-instead "Chat Instead") documentation for more information.

### Complete User Experience Review

Apple requires a Brand Experience QA review before the channel can be launched. Please work with your Engagement Manager to prepare and schedule for the QA review. See the [Apple User Experience Review](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/messaging-documentation/pass-apple-qa) documentation for more information.

### Determine Launch & Throttling Strategy

Depending on the entry points configured, your Engagement Manager will share launch best practices and throttling strategies.

## Customer Authentication

Apple Messages for Business supports Customer Authentication, which allows for a better and personalized customer experience. You can implement Authentication using OAuth.

### OAuth

* Requires OAuth 2.0 implemented by customer
* No support for biometric (fingerprint/Face Id) authentication on device
* Does not require native iOS app

User Authentication in Apple Messages for Business can utilize a standards-based approach using an OAuth 2.0 flow with additional key validation and OAuth token encryption steps.

This approach requires customers to implement and host a login page that Apple Messages for Business will invoke to authenticate the user. Users will have to sign-in with their credentials every time their OAuth token expires.

<Note>
  Additional steps are required to support authorization for users with devices running versions older than iOS 15. Consult your ASAPP account team for more information.
</Note>

#### Latest Authentication Flow

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-4981a05a-081b-9180-1ac9-12f640edffd0.png" />
</Frame>

#### Old Authentication Flow

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-b9a1eb95-8d3b-f80b-e3bb-7c6cd50a8654.jpeg" />
</Frame>

ASAPP requires the following customer functionalities to support the older authentication flow:

* An OAuth 2.0 login flow, including a login page that supports form autofill. This page must be Apple-compliant. See the [Authentication Message](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/msp-rest-api/type-interactive#authentication-message) documentation for more details.
* Provide an API endpoint for ASAPP to obtain an external user identifier. This should be the same identifier that is supplied via the ASAPP web and mobile SDKs as the CustomerId.
* Provide an endpoint through which to obtain an access token by supplying an authcode. This endpoint must support URL encoded parameters.
* Provide an endpoint that can accepted POST requests in the following format:

  ```json
       Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
       grant_type=authorization_code&code=xxxx
       &client_id=yyyy&client_secret=zzzz
  where:
  xxxx=authorization_code value
  yyyy=client_id value
  zzzz=client_secret value
  ```

<Note>
  The authorization request from the device to the customer's login page will always contain response\_type, client\_id, redirect\_uri, scope and state and will be application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  Also note that the older authentication flow is backwards-compatible for iOS versions 16+.
</Note>


# Chat Instead Overview
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/chat-instead



Chat Instead is a feature that allows you to prompt customers to chat instead of calling. When customer volume shifts from calls to chat, this reduces costs and improves the customer experience.

You can use any ASAPP SDK to display a menu when a customer taps on a phone number to give them the option to Chat Instead or to call.

To enable this feature:

1. Identify Call buttons or phone numbers on your website that you want to convert into entry points for Chat Instead.
2. Use the Chat Instead API, which is part of the ASAPP SDK.
3. Contact your Implementation Manager to configure Chat Instead.

## Requirements

Chat Instead requires ASAPP Android Chat SDK 8.0.0 or later, and a valid phone number. Before you proceed, make sure you configure it [correctly](/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk).

## Phone Formats

Chat Instead accepts a wide variety of formats. See [tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3966](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3966) for the precise definition. For example, it will accept: "+1 (555) 555-5555" and "555-555-5555".

## Getting Started

There are two ways to add Chat Instead. The easiest way is to add the `ASAPPChatInsteadButton` to the layout and call the `ASAPPChatInsteadButton.init`. Alternatively, you can manage the lifecycle yourself.

### 1. Add an ASAPPChatInsteadButton

You can add this button to any layout, like any other [AppCompatButton](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/appcompat/widget/AppCompatButton).

```json
<com.asapp.chatsdk.views.ASAPPChatInsteadButton
    android:id="@+id/button"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/button_chat_instead"
    />
```

After that, be sure to call the `ASAPPChatInsteadButton.init` method. Only the phone number is mandatory. Optionally, you can overwrite the `ASAPPChatInsteadButton.onChannel` and the `ASAPPChatInsteadButton.onError` properties of the button.

### 2. Manual Setup of ASAPPChatInstead

1. Initialize Chat Instead
   Somewhere after the `ASAPP.init` call:
   ```json
   val chatInstead = ASAPPChatInstead.init(phoneNumber)
   ```
   to initialize Chat Instead. Depending on cache, this will trigger a network call so channels are "immediately" available to the user once the fragment is displayed.
   Along with an optional header and a chat icon, you can pass callbacks to be notified when a channel is tapped or an error on a channel happens.
   ASAPP makes both callbacks after Chat Instead has tried to act on the tap.
2. Display Channels
   With the instance returned by `ASAPPChatInstead.init`, call `ASAPPChatInstead.show` whenever you want to display the [BottomSheetDialogFragment](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/bottomsheet/BottomSheetDialogFragment?hl=en). Depending on cache, this might show a loading state.
3. Clear Chat Instead (optional)
   You can interrupt the Chat Instead initial network call, if you call `ASAPPChatInstead.clear`. ASAPP advises you to add the call `onDestroy` for Activities and `onDetachedFromWindow` for Fragments.
   If you call `ASAPPChatInstead.clear` after you create the [BottomSheetDialogFragment](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/bottomsheet/BottomSheetDialogFragment?hl=en) view, it will have no effect.

## Error Handling and Debugging

In the case of problems, look for logs with the "ASAPPChatInstead" tag. Be sure to call `ASAPP.setDebugLoggingEnabled(true)` to enable the logs.
Alternatively, you can set callbacks with `ASAPPChatInstead.init`.

### Troubleshoot Chat Instead Errors

#### Crash Caused by UnsupportedOperationException when Displaying the Fragment

This occurs whenever `asapp_primary` is not defined in the style used by the calling Activity. Please refer to **Customization > Colors**.

#### "Unknown Channel" in the Log or the onError Callback

Talk to your Implementation Manager at ASAPP. ASAPP's Backend sent a channel we don't know how to handle. You might need to upgrade the Android SDK version.

#### "Unknown Error" in the Log

Talk to your Implementation Manager at ASAPP. This might be a bug. Please attach logs and reproduction steps.

#### "Activity Context Not Found" in the Log

It means you are not sending the right context at `ASAPPChatInstead.show`.

## Tablet and Landscape Support

Chat Instead supports these configurations seamlessly.

## Customization

</Frame>

### Header

By default it will use the text in `R.string.asapp_chat_instead_default_header`. You can send a different string when initializing Chat Instead, but it's important to know the ASAPP Backend will overwrite it if the call is successful.

### Chat Icon

You can customize the SDK Chat channel icon. By default it will be tinted with `asapp_primary` and `asapp_on_primary`.

<Note>
  If you customize the icon, make sure to test how it looks in Night Mode (a.k.a. Dark Mode).
</Note>

### Colors

Chat Instead uses the ASAPP text styles and colors. For more information on how to customize, go to [Customization](../android-sdk/customization "Customization").

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-961a0a3b-ce7b-5e66-626b-9d8c94629478.png" />
</Frame>

## Remote settings

Chat Instead receives configuration information from ASAPP's Backend (BE), in addition to the channels to display. The configuration enables/disables the feature and selects the device type (mobile, tablet, none). Contact your Implementation Manager at ASAPP if you have any questions.

<Note>
  It's important to know how the BE affects customization. If you provide a header, the BE will overwrite it. On the other hand, the BE cannot overwrite the phone number.
</Note>

## Cache

Chat Instead will temporarily cache the displayed channels to provide a better user experience. The cache is warmed at instantiation. The information will persist through phone restarts. As usual, it won't survive an uninstall or a "clear cache" in App info.


# iOS
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/chat-instead/ios



## Pre-requisites

* ASAPP iOS SDK 9.4.0 or later, correctly configured and initialized [see more here](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/ios-quick-start).

## Getting Started

Once you've successfully configured and initialized the ASAPP SDK, you can start using Chat Instead for iOS.

1. Create a New Instance.

   ```json
   let chatInsteadViewController =  ASAPPChatInsteadViewController(phoneNumber: phoneNumber, delegate: delegate, title: title, chatIcon: image)
   ```

   |                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | phoneNumber (required) | The phone number to call when the phone channel is selected. Must be a valid phone number. For more information, see Apple's documentation on [phone links](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/PhoneLinks/PhoneLinks). |
   | delegate (required)    | An object that implements `ASAPPChannelDelegate`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | title (optional)       | A title (also called the "Chat Instead header title") which is displayed at the top of the Chat Instead UI. (See [Customization](#customization "Customization"))                                                                                                          |
   | image (optional)       | A UI Image that will override the default image for the chat channel. (See [Customization](#customization "Customization"))                                                                                                                                                |

2. Implement two functions that the `ASAPPChannelDelegate` requires:

   ```json
   func channel(_ channel: ASAPPChannel, didFailToOpenWithErrorDescription errorDescription: String?)
   ```

   This is called if there's an error while trying to open a channel.

   ```json
   func didSelectASAPPChatChannel()
   ```

   This opens the ASAPP chat.

   You should use one of these methods:

   ```json
   ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPresentingFromChatInstead()
   ```

   or

   ```json
   ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPushingFromChatInstead()
   ```

   to present or push the view controller instance that was returned.

   This means that you must present/push the ASAPP chat view controller inside `didSelectASAPPChatChannel()`.

<Note>
  ASAPP highly recommends initializing `ASAPPChatInsteadViewController` as early as possible for the best user experience.
</Note>

Whenever a channel is selected, ASAPP handles everything by default (except for the chat channel), but you can also handle a channel by yourself by implementing `func shouldOpenChannel(_ channel: ASAPPChannel) -> Bool` and returning false.

3. Show the `chatInsteadViewController` instance by using:

   ```json
   present(chatInsteadViewController, animated: true)
   ```

<Note>
  Only presentation is supported. Pushing the `chatInsteadViewController` instance is not supported and will result in unexpected behavior.
</Note>

## Support for iPad

For the best user experience, you should configure popover mode, which is used on iPad.

Use the `.popover` presentation style and set both the [sourceView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipopoverpresentationcontroller/1622313-sourceview) and [sourceRect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipopoverpresentationcontroller/1622324-sourcerect) properties following Apple's conventions:

```json
chatInsteadViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .popover
chatInsteadViewController.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = aView
chatInsteadViewController.popoverPresentationController?.sourceRect = aRect
```

This will only have an effect when your app is run on iPad.

<Note>
  If you set `modalPresentationStyle` to `.popover` and forget to set `sourceView` and `sourceRect`, the application will crash in runtime. So please be sure to set both if you're using the popover mode.
</Note>

## Customization

You can customize the Chat Instead header title and the chat icon when creating the `ASAPPChatInsteadViewController` instance. (ee [Getting Started](#getting-started "iOS").

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-fe1fe0e0-a7e7-d065-110c-b3b24627847b.png" />
</Frame>

`ASAPPChatInsteadViewController` uses [ASAPPColors](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/ios/latest/Classes/ASAPPColors.html) for styling, so it will automatically use the colors set there (e.g. `primary`, `background`, `onBackground`, etc.), which are the same colors used for customizing the ASAPP chat interface. There is no way to independently change the styling of the Chat Instead UI.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-59879767-4622-5d70-522e-12ca0b7a8f8f.png" />
</Frame>

ASAPP supports [Dark Mode](../ios-sdk/customization#dark-mode-15935 "Dark Mode") by default as long as you enable it.

## Remote settings

When you create an instance of `ASAPPChatInsteadViewController`, it will automatically fetch remote settings to indicate which channels to display. You can configure these settings.

<Note>
  These remote settings will override local ones (i.e. the ones you pass in when creating the `ASAPPChatInsteadViewController` instance).
</Note>

If there's an error while fetching the settings and no local values were set, the defaults will be used.

## Cache

When fetching succeeds, the SDK will cache the remote settings for a short period of time. This cache will be referenced in lieu of repeated fetches. The cache will be valid across multiple app sessions.


# Web
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/chat-instead/web



A feature that prompts customers to use Chat instead of calling. When customers shift volume from phone to chat, this reduces costs and improves the customer experience.
When customers tap a phone number, phone button, or any other entry point that the customer company chooses, ASAPP triggers an intercept that gives the customer the option to chat or to call.
In order to enable this feature, please:

1. Identify Entry Points.
   Contact your Implementation Manager to determine the best entry point to Chat Instead on your website. On Mobile, the best entry point is a "Call" button or a clickable phone number. On Desktop, the best entry point is a "Call" button.

<Note>
  ASAPP recommends that you modify your website to display a "Call Us" button (or other similar language) rather than displaying the phone number, and the "Call Us" button should invoke Chat Instead.
</Note>

<Note>
  ASAPP recommends that you also make all entry points telephone links (href="tel" number).
</Note>

<Note>
  The customer company must specify the formatting to display for the phone number that they pass to the [showChatInstead](../web-sdk/web-javascript-api#-showchatinstead- "'showChatInstead'") API: (800) 123-4567
</Note>

**Example Use Case:**

```json
<a href="tel:8001234567" onclick="ASAPP('showChatInstead', {'phoneNumber': '(800) 123-4567'})">(800) 123-4567</a>
```

2. Integrate with the [showChatInstead](../web-sdk/web-javascript-api#-showchatinstead- "'showChatInstead'") API.
3. Chat Instead receives configuration information from ASAPP's Backend (BE), in addition to the channels to display and the order to display them in. Contact your Implementation Manager to turn on Chat Instead and configure these options. If you would like to use Apple Business Chat or other messaging application as an option within Chat Instead, please inform your Implementation Manager.
   This feature is currently available in the mobile Web SDK and desktop Web SDK.

# Customer Authentication
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/customer-authentication



Customer Authentication enables consistent and personalized conversations across channels and over time. The authentication requirements consist of two main elements:

1. A customer identifier
2. An access token

The source, format, and use of these items depends on the customer's infrastructure and services.  However, where applicable and feasible, ASAPP instills a few direct requirements for integration of these components.

This section outlines the requirements and considerations in the sections below.

Integrations leveraging customer authentication enable two main features of ASAPP:

1. Combination of the conversation history of a customer into a single view to enable the true asynchronous behavior of ASAPP.  This allows a customer to come back over time as well as change communication channels but maintain a consistent state and experience.
2. Validation of a customer and make API calls for a customer's data to display to a representative or directly to the customer.  

The following sequence diagram depicts an example of a customer authentication integration utilizing OAuth customer credentials and a JSON Web Token (JWT) for API calls.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-b551c5ab-cc5f-53ef-eb15-3073377c72a6.png" />
</Frame>

## Identification

### What is a Customer Identifier?

A customer identifier is the first and most important piece of the Customer Authentication strategy. The identifier is the key element to determine:

* when to transition from unauthenticated to authenticated
* when to show previous conversation history within chat

When a customer returns with the same identifier, the customer sees all previous history within web and mobile chat. These identifiers are typically string values of hashed or encrypted account numbers or other internal values. However, it is important to not send identifiable or reusable information as the customer identifier, such as their actual unprotected account numbers or PII.

### Customer Identifier Format

The customer may determine the format of the customer identifier. The ASAPP requirements for the customer identifier are:

* Consistent - the same customer must authenticate using the same customer identifier every time.
* Unique - the customer identifier must represent a unique customer; No two customers can have the same identifier.
* Opaque - ASAPP does not store PII data. The customer must obfuscate the customer identifier so it does not contain PII or any other sensitive data. An example of obfuscation strategy is to generate a hash or an encrypted value of a unique user identifier (e.g. user ID, account number, or email address).
* Traceable - customer-traceable but not ASAPP-traceable.
  * The customer must be able to trace the customer identifier back to a user. However, it cannot be used by ASAPP, or any other party, to trace back to a specific user.
  * The reporting data generated by ASAPP includes the customer identifier. This reporting data is typically used to generate further analytics by the customer. You can use the customer identifier to relate ASAPP's reporting data back to the actual user identifier and record on the customer side.

### Passing the Customer Identifier to ASAPP

Once a customer authenticates a user on their website or app, the customer must retrieve and pass the customer identifier to ASAPP ( typically via the SDK parameters) as part of the conversation authentication flow.

You can find more details for your specific integration in the following sections:

* [Web SDK - Web Authentication](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-authentication "Web Authentication")
* [Android SDK - Chat User Authentication in the Android Integration Walkthrough](/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/user-authentication)
* [iOS SDK - Basic Usage in the iOS SDK Quick Start](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/ios-quick-start)iOS SDK

## Tokens

While they are not a hard requirement for Customer Authentication, tokens play an important part in the overall Customer Authentication strategy. Tokens provide a way of securely wrapping all communication between Customers, Customer Companies and ASAPP. You can achieve this when you ensure that every request to a server is accompanied by a signed token, which ASAPP can verify for authenticity.

Some of the benefits of using tokens over other methods, such as cookies, is that tokens are completely stateless and are typically short-lived. The following sections outline some examples of token input, as well as requirements for their use and validation.

### Identity Tokens

Identity tokens are self contained, signed, short-lived tokens containing User Attributes like Name, User Identifiers, Contact Information, Claims, and Roles. The simplest and most common example of such a token is a JSON Web Token, JWT. JWTs contain a Header, Payload and Signature. The Header contains metadata about the token, the Payload contains the user info and claims, and the Signature is the algorithmically signed portion of the token based on the payload. You can find more information about JWTs at [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/).

**Example JWT:**

```json
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

### Bearer Tokens

A Bearer Token is a lightweight security token which provides the bearer, or user, access to protected resources. When a user authenticates, a Bearer Token type is issued that contains an access token and a refresh token, along with expiration details. Bearer tokens are short-lived, dynamic access tokens that can be updated throughout a session using a refresh token.

**Example Bearer Token:**

```json
{
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "access_token":"eyJhbGci....",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "expires_on":1479937454,
  "refresh_token":"0/LTo...."
}
```

### Token Duration

Since every token has an expiration time, you need a way for ASAPP to know when a token is valid and when it expires. A customer can do this by:

* allowing decoding of signed tokens.
* providing an API to validate the token.

#### Token Refresh

You need to refresh expired tokens on either the client side, via the ASAPP SDK, or through an API call. 

You can find SDK token refresh implementation examples at:

* [Web SDK - Web Context Provider](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider#authentication "Web ContextProvider")
* [Web SDK - Set Customer](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#setcustomer "'setCustomer'")
* [Android SDK - Context Provider](/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/user-authentication)
* [iOS SDK - Type Aliases](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/ios/latest/Typealiases.html)

#### Token Validation

You need to validate tokens before you can rely on them for API access or user information. Two examples of token validation are:

* **Compare multiple pieces of information** - ASAPP compares a JWT payload against the SDK input of the same attributes, or against response data from a UserProfile API call.
* **Signature Validation** - ASAPP can also validate signatures and decode data if needed. This would require sharing of a trusted public certificate with ASAPP.

## Omni-Channel Strategy

One of the key capabilities of the ASAPP backend is that it supports customer interaction via multiple channels - such as chat on web portals or within mobile apps. This enables a customer to migrate from one channel to another, if they choose, within the same support dialog. In order for this to function, it is important that the process of Customer Authentication be common to all channels. The ASAPP backend should obtain the same access token to access the Customer's API endpoints regardless of the channel that the customer selects. If a customer switches from one channel to another, the access token should remain the same.

## Testing

You need a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure success. This includes the ability to exercise edge cases with various permutations of test account data, as well as utilize the customer login with direct test account credentials.  Operationally, the customer handles customer login credentialing; however, ASAPP requires the ability to simulate the login process in order to execute end to end tests.  This process is crucial in performing test scenarios that require customer authentication. Corollary, it is equally important to ensure complete test scenario coverage with different types of test-based customer accounts.


# iOS SDK Overview
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk



Welcome to the ASAPP iOS SDK Overview! This document guides you through the process of integrating ASAPP functionality into your iOS application. It includes the following sections:

* [Quick Start](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/ios-quick-start "iOS Quick Start")
* [Customization](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/customization "Customization")
* [User Authentication](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/user-authentication "User Authentication")
* [Miscellaneous APIs](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/miscellaneous-apis "Miscellaneous APIs")
* [Deep Links and Web Links](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/deep-links-and-web-links "Deep Links and Web Links")
* [Push Notifications](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/push-notifications "Push Notifications")

In addition, you can view the following documentation:

* [iOS SDK Release Notes](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/ios-sdk-release-notes "iOS SDK Release Notes")

## Requirements

ASAPP supports iOS 12.0 and up. As a rule, ASAPP supports two major versions behind the latest. Once iOS 15 is released, ASAPP will drop support for iOS 12 and only support iOS 13.0 and up.

The SDK is written in Swift 5 and compiled with support for binary stability, meaning it is compatible with any Swift compiler version greater than or equal to 5.


# Customization
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/customization



## Styling

### Themes

There is one main color that you can set to ensure the ASAPP chat view controller fits with your app's theme: `ASAPP.styles.colors.primary`.

ASAPP recommends starting out only setting `.primary` to be your brand's primary color, and adjusting other colors when necessary for accessibility.

`.primary` is used as the message bubble background and in most buttons and other controls.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-9d0baf87-860b-2383-b391-bdf5bac8d426.png" />
</Frame>

There are two other colors you may consider customizing for accessibility or to achieve an exact match with your app's theme: `ASAPP.styles.colors.onBackground` and `.onPrimary`. `.onBackground` is used for most other elements that might appear in front of the background. `.onPrimary` is used for text and other elements that appear in front of the primary color.

### Fonts

The ASAPP SDK uses the iOS system font family, SF Pro, by default. To use another font family, pass an `ASAPPFontFamily` to `ASAPP.styles.textStyles.updateStyles(for:)`. There are two `ASAPPFontFamily` initializers: one that takes font file names and another that takes `UIFont` references.

```json
let avenirNext = ASAPPFontFamily(
    lightFontName: “AvenirNext-Regular”,
    regularFontName: “AvenirNext-Medium”,
    mediumFontName: “AvenirNext-DemiBold”,
    boldFontName: “AvenirNext-Bold”)!
ASAPP.styles.textStyles.updateStyles(for: avenirNext)
```

## Overrides

The ASAPP SDK API allows you to override many aspects of the design of the chat interface, including [colors](#colors "Colors"), [button styles](#buttons "Buttons"), [navigation bar styles](#navigation-bar-styles "Navigation Bar Styles"), and various [text styles](#text-styles "Text Styles").

### Colors

Besides the colors used for themes, you can override specific colors in a number of categories:

* Navigation bar
* General chat content
* Buttons
* Messages
* Quick replies
* Input field.

All property names mentioned below are under `ASAPP.styles.colors`.

Navigation bar colors are .`navBarBackground`, `.navBarTitle`, `.navBarButton`, and `.navBarButtonActive`.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-639758e9-7260-7b8b-e6e9-9cd67b1c4da7.png" />
</Frame>

General chat content colors are `.background`, `.separatorPrimary`, `.separatorSecondary`, `.controlTint`, `.controlSecondary`, `.controlBackground`, `.success`, `.warning`, and `.failure`.

  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-93c9f7d7-4d6c-e37c-1816-883e33edce1f.png" />
</Frame>

Message colors are `.messagesListBackground`, `.messageText`, `.messageBackground`, `.messageBorder`, `.replyMessageText`, `.replyMessageBackground`, and `.replyMessageBorder`.

</Frame>

Quick replies and action buttons also use `ASAPPButtonColors`. You can override `.quickReplyButton` and `.actionButton`.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-b2a23eeb-86b6-0032-f726-a9220f8b0291.png" />

</Frame>

The chat input field uses `ASAPPInputColors`. You can override `.chatInput`.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-bf5cc2e4-5f01-607e-a718-9b640bb8d519.png" />
</Frame>

### Text Styles

ASAPP strongly recommends that you use one font family as described in the [Fonts](#fonts) section. However, if you need to, you may override: `ASAPP.styles.textStyles.navButton`, `.button`, `.actionButton`, `.link`, `.header1`, `.header2`, `.header3`, `.subheader`, `.body`, `.bodyBold`, `.body2`, `.bodyBold2`, `.detail1`, `.detail2`, and `.error`. To update all but the first four with a color, call `ASAPP.styles.textStyles.updateColors(with:)`.

### Navigation Bar Styles

You can override the default `ASAPP.styles.navBarStyles.titlePadding` using `UIEdgeInsets`.

### Buttons

The shape of primary buttons in message attachments, forms, and other dynamic layouts is determined by the value of `ASAPP.styles.primaryButtonRoundingStyle`. The default value is `.radius(0)`. You can set it to a custom radius with `.radius(_:)` or fully rounded with `.pill`.

## Images

### Navigation Bar

There are three images used in the chat view controller's navigation bar that are overridable: the icons for the **close ✕**, **back ⟨**, and **more ⋮** buttons. Each is tinted appropriately, so the image need only be a template in black with an alpha channel. ASAPP displays only one of the **close** and **back** buttons at a time; the former is used when the chat view controller is presented modally, and the latter when pushed onto a navigation stack.

```json
ASAPP.styles.navBarStyles.buttonImages.close
ASAPP.styles.navBarStyles.buttonImages.back
ASAPP.styles.navBarStyles.buttonImages.more
```

Use the `ASAPPCustomImage(image:size:insets:)` initializer to override each:

```json
ASAPP.styles.navBarStyles.buttonImages.more = ASAPPCustomImage(
    image: UIImage(named: “Your More Icon Name”)!,
     size: CGSize(width: 20, height: 20),
     insets: UIEdgeInsets(top: 14, left: 0, bottom: 14, right: 0))
```

### Title View

To use a custom title view, assign `ASAPP.views.chatTitle`. If you set a custom title view, it will override any string you set as `ASAPP.strings.chatTitle`. The title view will be rendered in the center of the navigation bar.

## Dark Mode

Apple introduced Dark Mode in iOS 13. Please see Apple's [Supporting Dark Mode in Your Interface](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface) documentation for an overview.

The ASAPP SDK does not automatically convert any colors for use in Dark Mode; you must define dark variants for each custom color at the app level, which the SDK will use automatically when the interface style changes.

ASAPP recommends that you add a Dark Appearance to colors you define in color sets in an asset catalog. Please see [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface#2993897) for more details. Once you have defined a color set, you can refer to it by name with the `UIColor(named:)` initializer, which was introduced in iOS 11. After you have defined a dark variant for at least the primary color, be sure to set it and flip the Dark Mode flag:

```json
ASAPP.styles.colors.primary = UIColor(named: "Your Primary Color Name")!
ASAPP.styles.isDarkModeAllowed = true
```

<Note>
  ASAPP highly recommends adding a Dark Appearance for any color you set. Please don't forget to define a Dark Appearance for your custom logo if you have set `ASAPP.views.chatTitle`.
</Note>

If your app does not support Dark Mode, ASAPP recommends that you do not change the value of `ASAPP.styles.isDarkModeAllowed` to ensure a consistent user experience.

</Frame>

## Orientation

The default value of `ASAPP.styles.allowedOrientations` is `.portraitLocked`, meaning the chat view controller will always render in portrait orientation. To allow landscape orientation on an iPad, set it to `.iPadLandscapeAllowed` instead. There is currently no landscape orientation option for iPhone.

## Strings

Please see the class reference for details on each member of `ASAPPStrings`.


# Deep Links and Web Links
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/deep-links-and-web-links



## Handle Deep Links in Chat

Certain chat flows may present buttons that are deep links to another part of your app. To react to taps on these buttons, implement the `ASAPPDelegate` protocol, including the `chatViewControlledDidTapDeepLink(name:data:)` method. Please ask your Implementation Manager if you have questions regarding deep link names and data.

## Handle Web Links in Chat

Certain chat flows may present buttons that are web links. To react to taps on these buttons, implement the `ASAPPDelegate` protocol, including the `chatViewControllerShouldHandleWebLink(url:)` method. Return true if the ASAPP SDK should open the link in an `SFSafariViewController`; return `false` if you'd like to handle it instead.

## Implement Deep Links into Chat

### Getting Started

Please see Apple's documentation on [Allowing Apps and Websites to Link to Your Content](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content).

### Connect the Pieces

Once you have set up a custom URL scheme for your app, you can detect links pointing to ASAPP chat within `application(_:open:options:)`. Call one of the four provided methods to create an ASAPP chat view controller:

```json
ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPushing(fromNotificationWith:)
ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPresenting(fromNotificationWith:)
ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPushing(withIntent:)
ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPresenting(withIntent:)
```


# iOS Quick Start
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/ios-quick-start



If you want to start fast, follow these steps:

1. [Gather Required Information](#1-gather-required-information "1. Gather Required Information")
2. [Download the SDK](#2-download-the-sdk "2. Download the SDK")
3. [Install the SDK](#3-install-the-sdk "3. Install the SDK")
4. [Configure the SDK](#4-configure-the-sdk "4. Configure the SDK")
5. [Open Chat](#5-open-chat "5. Open Chat")

## 1. Gather Required Information

Before downloading and installing the SDK, please make sure you have the following information. Contact your Implementation Manager at ASAPP if you have any questions.

| App ID               | Also known as the "Company Marker", assigned by ASAPP.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Host Name        | The fully-qualified domain name used by the SDK to communicate with ASAPP's API. Provided by ASAPP and subject to change based on the stage of implementation.                                                                         |
| Region Code          | The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the region of the implementation, provided by ASAPP.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Supported Languages  | Your app's supported languages, in order of preference, as an array of language tag strings. Strings can be in the format "\{ISO 639-1 Code}-\{ISO 3166-1 Code}" or "\{ISO 639-1 Code}", such as "en-us" or "en". Defaults to \["en"]. |
| Client Secret        | This can be an empty or random string\* until otherwise notified by ASAPP.                                                                                                                                                             |
| User Identifier      | A username or similar value used to identify and authenticate the customer, provided by the Customer Company.                                                                                                                          |
| Authentication Token | A password-equivalent value, which may or may not expire, used to authenticate the customer that is provided by the Customer Company.                                                                                                  |

\* In the future, the ASAPP-provided client secret will be a string that authorizes the integrated SDK to call the ASAPP API in production. ASAPP recommends fetching this string from a server and storing it securely using Secure Storage; however, as it is one of many layers of security, you can hard-code the client secret.

## 2. Download the SDK

Download the iOS SDK from the [ASAPP iOS SDK releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/asappinc/chat-sdk-ios-release/releases).

## 3. Install the SDK

ASAPP provides the SDK as an `.xcframework` with and without bitcode in dynamic and static flavors. If in doubt, ASAPP recommends that you use the dynamic `.xcframework` with bitcode.

Add your chosen flavor of the framework to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section of your target's "General" settings.

### Include SDK Resources When Using the Static Framework

Add the provided `ASAPPResources.bundle` to your target's "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" and then include it in your target's "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase.

The SDK allows a customer to take and upload photos, [unless these features are disabled through configuration](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/ios/latest/Classes/ASAPP.html#/Permissions). Since iOS 10, Apple requires descriptions for why your app uses the photo library and/or camera, which will be displayed to the customer. If you haven't already, you'll need to add these descriptions to your app's `Info.plist`.

* If you access `Info.plist` via Xcode's plist editor, the description keys are "Privacy - Camera Usage Description" and "Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description".
* If you access `Info.plist` via a text editor, the keys are "NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription" and "NSCameraUsageDescription".

### Validate iOS SDK Authenticity

ASAPP uses GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) for creating digital signatures. To install on macOS:

1. Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), install gpg:
   `brew install gpg`
2. Download the [ASAPP SDK Team public key](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/ios/security/asapp_public.gpg).
3. Add the key to GPG:
   `gpg --import asapp_public.gpg`

Optionally, you can also validate the public key. Please refer to the [GPG documentation](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals.html) for more information.

Then, you can verify the signature using:

`gpg --verify <-sdk-filename>.sig <sdk-filename>`

ASAPP provides the signature alongside the SDK in each release.

## 4. Configure the SDK

Use the code below to create a config, initialize the SDK with the config, and set an anonymous user. Refer to the aforementioned [Required Information](#1-gather-required-information-15931 "1. Gather Required Information") for more details. ASAPP recommends that you initialize the SDK on launch in `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions…)`. Please see the [User Authentication](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/user-authentication "User Authentication") section for details about how to authenticate an identified user.

```json
import ASAPPSDK
let config = ASAPPConfig(appId: appId,
                         apiHostName: apiHostName,
                         clientSecret: clientSecret,
                         regionCode: regionCode)
ASAPP.initialize(with: config)
ASAPP.user = ASAPPUser(nil, requestContextProvider: { _ in return [:] })
```

## 5. Open Chat

Once the SDK has been initialized with a config and a user has been set, you can create a chat view controller that can then be pushed onto the navigation stack. ASAPP recommends doing so when a navigation bar button is tapped.

```json
let chatViewController =
ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPushing(fromNotificationWith: nil)!
navigationController?.pushViewController(chatViewController, animated: true)
```

If you prefer to present the chat view controller as a modal, use the `ForPresenting` method instead:

```json
let chatViewController =
ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPresenting(fromNotificationWith: nil)!
present(chatViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Once the chat interface is open, you should see an initial state similar to the one below:

<Frame>

The scrolling window below shows release notes for ASAPP's iOS SDK.
This content may also be viewed as a stand-alone webpage here: [https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/ios/releasenotes](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/ios/releasenotes)


# Miscellaneous APIs
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/miscellaneous-apis



## Conversation Status

Call `ASAPP.getChatStatus(success:failure:)` to get the current conversation status. The first parameter of the success handler provides a count of unread messages, while the second indicates whether the chat is live. If `isLive` is true, it means the customer is currently connected to a live customer support agent, even if the user isn't currently on the chat screen or the application is in the background.
**Example:**

```json
ASAPP.getChatStatus(success: { unread, isLive in
    DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
        self?.updateBadge(count: unread, isLive: isLive)
    }
}, failure: { error in
    print("Could not get chat status: \(error)")
})
```

## Debug Logs

To allow the SDK to print more debugging information to the console, set `ASAPP.debugLogLevel` to.debug. Please see [`ASAPPLogLevel`](https://docs-sdk.asapp.com/api/chatsdk/ios/latest/Enums/ASAPPLogLevel.html) for more options and make sure to set the level to `.errors` or `.none` in release builds.
Example:

```json
#if DEBUG
ASAPP.debugLogLevel = .debug
#else
ASAPP.debugLogLevel = .none
#endif
```

## Clear the Persisted Session

To clear the session persisted on disk, call `ASAPP.clearSavedSession()`. This will also disable push notifications to the customer.

## Set an Intent

To open chat with an initial intent, call one of the two functions below, passing in a dictionary specifying the intent in a format provided by ASAPP. Please ask your Implementation Manager for details.

### Create a Chat View Controller with an Initial Intent

```json
let chat = ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPushing(withIntent: [“Code”: 
“EXAMPLE_INTENT”])
or
let chat = ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPresenting(withIntent: 
[“Code”: “EXAMPLE_INTENT”])
```

To set the intent while chat is already open, call `ASAPP.setIntent(_:)`, passing in a dictionary as described above. This should only be called if a chat view controller already exists.

## Handle Chat Events

Certain agreed-upon events may occur during chat. To react to these events, implement the `ASAPPDelegate` protocol, including the `chatViewControllerDidReceiveChatEvent(name:data:)` method. Please ask your Implementation Manager if you have questions regarding chat event names and data.


# Push Notifications
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/push-notifications



## Get Started with Push Notifications

Please see Apple's documentation on the [Apple Push Notification service](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1) and the [User Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) framework.

## ASAPP Push Notifications

ASAPP's systems may trigger push notifications at certain times, such as when an agent sends a message to a customer who does not currently have the chat interface open. These push notifications are triggered by ASAPP's servers calling your company's API with data that identifies the recipient's device; ASAPP's servers do not communicate with APNs directly. Therefore, we provide methods in the SDK to register and deregister the customer's device for ASAPP push notifications.
For a deeper dive on how push notifications are handled between ASAPP and your company's API, please see our documentation on [Push Notifications and the Mobile SDKs](../push-notifications-and-the-mobile-sdks "Push Notifications and the Mobile SDKs").

### Enable Push Notifications

To enable push notifications for the current user when using the token provided by APNs in `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken(_:)`, call `ASAPP.enablePushNotifications(with deviceToken: Data)`.
To enable push notifications using an arbitrary string that uniquely identifies the device and current user, call `ASAPP.enablePushNotifications(with uuid: String)`.

### Disable Push Notifications

To disable push notifications for the current user on the device, call `ASAPP.disablePushNotifications(failure:)`. The failure handler will be called in the event of an error. Make sure you call this function before you change or clear `ASAPP.user` to prevent the customer receiving push notifications that are not meant for them.

### Handle Push Notifications

Implement `application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:[fetchCompletionHandler:])` and pass the `userInfo` dictionary to `ASAPP.canHandleNotification(with:)` to determine if the push notification was triggered by ASAPP. If the function returns `true`, you can then pass `userInfo` to: `ASAPP.createChatViewControllerForPushing(fromNotificationWith:)`.

<Note>
  Your application usually won't receive push notifications from ASAPP if the user is currently connected to chat.
</Note>

### Request Permissions for Push Notifications

When a user joins a queue in the ASAPP mobile app, a prompt screen asks them to enable push notifications and provides some context on the benefits. If the user has already accepted or denied these permissions, they will not receive this prompt.
After enablement, users will receive a push notification every time there is a new message in the app chat. Users only receive push notifications if the app is not active.
You can control this feature remotely. Please contact your Integration Manager for further information. ASAPP highly recommends that you enable this feature.


# User Authentication
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/user-authentication



## Set an ASAPPUser with a Request Context Provider

As in the Quick Start section, you can connect to chat as an anonymous user by specifying a nil user identifier when initializing an `ASAPPUser`. However, many use cases might require ASAPP to know the identity of the customer.
To connect as an identified user, please specify a user identifier string and a request context provider function. This provider will be called from a background thread when the SDK makes requests that require customer authentication with your company's servers. The request context provider is a function that returns a dictionary with keys and values agreed upon with ASAPP. Please ask your Implementation Manager if you have questions.
**Example:**

```json
let requestContextProvider = { needsRefresh in
    return [
        "Auth": [
            "Token": "exampleValue"
        ]
    ]
}
ASAPP.user = ASAPPUser(userIdentifier: "testuser@example.com",
requestContextProvider)
```

## Handle Login Buttons

If a customer connects to chat anonymously, they may be asked to log in when necessary by being shown a message button:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-38220938-03e4-8029-538b-b2a4e5c694ac.png" />
</Frame>

If the customer then taps on the **Sign In** button, the SDK will call a delegate method: `chatViewControllerDidTapUserLoginButton()`. Please implement this method and set `ASAPP.user` once the customer has logged in. The SDK will detect the change and then authenticate the user. You may set `ASAPP.user` in any thread. Make sure to set the delegate as well: for example, `ASAPP.delegate = self`. See `ASAPPDelegate` for more details.

## Token Expiration and Refresh the Context

In the event that the provided token has expired, the SDK will call the request context provider with an argument that is true, indicating that you must refresh the context. In that case, please make sure to return a dictionary with fresh credentials that the SDK can use to authenticate the user. If the SDK requires an API call to refresh the credentials, please make sure to block the calling thread until you can return the updated context.


# Push Notifications and the Mobile SDKs
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/push-notifications-and-the-mobile-sdks



## Use Cases

In ASAPP Chat, users can receive Push Notifications (a.k.a. ASAPP background messages) for the following reasons:

* **New live messages**: if a customer is talking to a live agent and leaves the chat interface, new messages can be delivered via Push Notifications.
* **Proactive messages**: used to notify customers about promotions, reminders, or other relevant information, depending on the requirements of the implementation.

If you are looking for a way to get the most recent Conversation Status, please see the [Android](/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/miscellaneous-apis "Miscellaneous APIs") or [iOS](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/miscellaneous-apis "Miscellaneous APIs") documentation.

</Frame>

Figure 2: Push Notification Overview 2 - Sending Push Notifications

## Device Token

After the Customer App (Figure 1) acquires the Device Token, it is then responsible to register it to the ASAPP SDK. ASAPP's servers use this token to send push notification requests to a Customer-provided API endpoint (Customer Backend), which in turn sends requests to Firebase and/or APNs.

The ASAPP SDK and servers act as the middle-man with regards to the Device Token. In general, the Device Token must be a string that uniquely identifies the device that is defined and generated by the customer.

The Device Token format and content can be customized to include the necessary information for the Customer's Backend service to send the push notifications. As an example, the Device Token can be a base64-encoded JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains the end user information required by the Customer's Backend service.

ASAPP does not need to understand the content of the Device Token; however, the Device Token is persisted within the ASAPP Push Notification system.

<Note>
  Please consult with us if there is a requirement to include one or more PII data fields in the Device Token.

  ASAPP's servers do not communicate directly with Firebase or APNs; it is the responsibility of the customer to do so.
</Note>

## Customer Implementation

This section details the customer work necessary to integrate Push Notifications in two parts: the App and the Backend.

### Customer App

The Customer App manages the Device Token. In order for ASAPP's servers to route notifications properly, the Customer App must register and deregister the token with the ASAPP SDK.

The Customer App also detects when push notifications are received and handles them accordingly.

#### Register for Push Notifications

Please refer to Figure 1 for a high level overview. There are usually two situations where the Customer App will need to register the Device Token:

* **App start**
  After you initialize the ASAPP SDK and set up the ASAPP User properly, register the Device Token.
* **Token update**
  In case the Device Token changes, register the token again.
  Please refer to the specific [Android](/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/notifications#push-notifications "Push Notifications") and [iOS](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/push-notifications "Push Notifications") docs for more detailed information.

#### Deregister for Disable Push Notifications

If the user signs out of the Customer App, it is important to call the SDK API to de-register for push notifications.

<Note>
  This must be done before changing the ASAPP user credentials so that the SDK can use those credentials to properly disable Push Notifications for the user who is signing out.
</Note>

<Note>
  If the device token de-registration isn't done properly, there's risk that the device will continue to receive Push Notifications for the user who previously signed out.
</Note>

Please refer to the specific [Android](/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/notifications#push-notifications "Push Notifications") and [iOS](/messaging-platform/integrations/ios-sdk/push-notifications "Push Notifications") docs for more detailed information.

#### Receive Messages in the Foreground

<Note>
  If the user is currently in chat, the message is sent directly to chat via WebSocket and no push notification is sent.
</Note>

See Scenario 2 in Figure 2.

On **Android**: you usually receive foreground Push Notifications via a Firebase callback. To check if this is an ASAPP-generated Push Notification, call `ASAPP.instance.getConversationStatusFromNotification`, which will return a non-null status object. The Customer App can now display user feedback as desired using the status object.

On **iOS**, if you have set a `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`, it calls [userNotificationCenter(\_:willPresent:withCompletionHandler:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate/1649518-usernotificationcenter) when a push notification is received while the app is in the foreground. In your implementation of that delegate method, call `ASAPP.canHandleNotification(with: notification.request.userInfo)` to determine if ASAPP generated the notification. An alternative method is to implement [application(\_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623013-application), which is called when a push notification is received regardless of whether the app is in the foreground or the background. In both cases, you can access `userInfo["UnreadMessages"]` to determine the number of unread messages.

#### Receive Push Notifications in the Background

See Scenario 1 in Figure 2.

When the App is in the background (or the device is locked), a system push notification displays as usual.

When the user opens the push notification:

* On **Android**: the App opens with an Android Intent. The Customer App can verify if the Intent is from an ASAPP generated Push Notification by calling the utility method `ASAPP.instance.shouldOpenChat` . This should open chat. See more details and code examples in the Android SDK [Handle Push Notifications](/messaging-platform/integrations/android-sdk/notifications#handle-push-notifications "Handle Push Notifications") section.
* On **iOS**: if the app is running in the background, it calls [application(\_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623013-application) as above. If the app is not running, the app will start and call [application(\_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application), with the notification's payload accessible at `launchOptions[.remoteNotification]`. Once again, call `ASAPP.canHandleNotification(with:)` to determine if ASAPP generated the notification.

### Customer Backend

It is common that the Customer solution already includes middleware that handles Push Notifications. This middleware usually provides the Customer App with the Device Tokens and sends Push Notification requests to Firebase and/or APNs. If the middleware provides an endpoint that can be called to trigger push notifications, ASAPP can integrate with it (given that the authentication strategy is in place). Otherwise, ASAPP requires that the Customer provides or implements an endpoint for this to take place.

ASAPP's Push Notification adapters call the provided endpoint with a previously agreed-upon payload format. The following is a payload example:

```json
{
  authToken: "auth-token",
  deviceToken: "the-device-token",
  payload: {
    aps: {
      alert: {
        title: "New Message",
        body: "Hello, how can we help?"
      }
    },
    ...  
  },
  ...
}
```

## ASAPP Implementation

### ASAPP Backend

For any new Push Notification Integration, ASAPP creates an "adapter" for ASAPP's Notification Hub service. This adapter translates messages sent by Agents to a request that is compatible with the Customer Backend. This usually means that the Notification Hub adapter makes HTTP calls to the Customer's specified endpoint, with a previously agreed-upon payload format.

### ASAPP SDK

The ASAPP Android and iOS SDKs already supply the interfaces and utilities needed for Customer Apps to register and de-register for Push Notifications.

### Testing Environments and QA

From a Quality Assurance standpoint, ASAPP requires access to lower-level environments with credentials so that we can properly develop and test new adapters.


# User Management
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/user-management



This section provides an overview of User Management (Roles and Permissions). These roles dictate if an ASAPP user can authenticate to *Agent Desk*, *Admin Dashboard*, or both. In addition, roles determine what view and data users see in the Admin Dashboard. You can pass User Data to ASAPP via *SSO*, AD/LDAP, or other approved integration.

This section describes the following:

* [Process Overview](#process-overview)
* [Resource Overview](#resource-overview)
* [Definitions](#definitions "Definitions")

## Process Overview

This is a high-level overview of the User Management setup process.

1. ASAPP demos the Desk/Admin Interface.
2. Call with ASAPP to confirm the access and permission requirements. ASAPP and you complete a Configuration spreadsheet defining all the Roles & Permissions.
3. ASAPP sends you a copy of the Configuration spreadsheet for review and approval. ASAPP will make additional changes if needed and send to you for approval.
4. ASAPP implements and tests the configuration.
5. ASAPP trains you to set up and modify User Management.
6. ASAPP goes live with your new Customer Interaction system.

# Voice
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/voice



The ASAPP Voice Agent Desk includes web-based agent-assist services, which provide telephone agents with a machine learning and natural-language processing powered desktop. Voice Agent Desk augments the agent's ability to respond to inbound telephone calls from end customers.

Voice Agent Desk augments the agents by allowing quick access to relevant customer information and provides actionable suggestions that ASAPP infers from the analysis of the ongoing conversation. The content, actions, and responses ASAPP provides to agents is meant to augment the agent's ability to respond quickly and more effectively to end customers.

Voice Agent Desk interfaces with relevant customer applications to enable desired features.

The ASAPP Voice Agent Desk is not in the call-path but is more of an active listener, and uses two different integrations to provide the real-time augmentation:

* [SIPREC](#glossary "Glossary") - you enable SIP RECording on the customer [Session Border Controllers (SBC)](#glossary "Glossary") and route a copy of the media stream, call information, and metadata per session to ASAPP.
* [CTI](#glossary "Glossary") Events - ASAPP subscribes to telephony events of the voice agents via the CTI server (login, logout, on-hook, off-hook, etc.)

You associate and aggregate the media sessions and CTI events within the ASAPP solution and use them to power the agent augmentation features presented in Voice Agent Desk to the agents.

The ASAPP Voice Agent Desk solution provides agents with the real-time features that automate many of their repeatable tasks. Agents can use Voice Agent Desk for:

* The real-time transcript
* Conversation Summary - where agents add notes and structured data tags that ASAPP suggests as well as disposition the call during the interaction and once it is complete.
* Agents login to Voice Agent Desk via the customer's SSO.
* Customer information (optional)
* Knowledge Base integration (optional)

## Customer Current State Solution

ASAPP works with you to understand your current telephony infrastructure and ecosystem, including the type of voice work assignment platform/s and other capabilities available, such as SIPREC.

</Frame>

## Solution Architecture

After the discovery of the customer's current state is complete, ASAPP completes the architecture definition, including integration points into the existing infrastructure. You can deploy the ASAPP [media gateways and media gateway proxies](#glossary "Glossary") within your existing AWS instance or within ASAPP's, providing additional flexibility and control.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-839c65f3-0236-c4c9-1573-b166e65e3b88.png" />

</Frame>

### Network Connectivity

ASAPP will determine the network connectivity between your infrastructure and the ASAPP AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) based on the architecture, however, there will be secure connections deployed between your data centers and the ASAPP VPC.

</Frame>

### Port Details

You can see ports and protocols in use for the Voice implementation depicted in the following diagram. These definitions provide visibility to your security teams for the provisioning of firewalls and ACL's.

* SIP/SIPREC - TCP (5060, 5070-5072)
  * SBC to Media Gateway Proxies
  * SBC to Media Gateway/s
* Audio Streams - UDP \<RTP/RTCP port range>
* CTI Event Feed - TCP \<vendor specific>
* API Endpoints - TCP 443
  In customer firewalls, you must disable the [SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG)](#glossary "Glossary") and any 'Threat Detection' features, as they typically interfere with the SIP dialogs and the re-INVITE process.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Data Flow

The Voice Agent Desk Data Flow diagram illustrates the [PCI Zone](#glossary "Glossary") within the ASAPP solution. The customer SBC originates the SIPREC sessions and the media streams and sends them to ASAPP media gateways, which repackage the streams into secure WebSockets and sends them to the [Voice Streamer](#glossary "Glossary") within the PCI zone. ASAPP encrypts the data in transit and at rest.

The SBC does not typically encrypt the SIPREC sessions and associated media streams from the SBC to the ASAPP media gateways, but usually encapsulates them within a secure connection. You are responsible for the compliance/security of the network path between the SBC and the media gateways, in accordance with applicable customer policies.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-3190e31d-1fc7-fcc3-57f6-aff9dee85513.png" />
</Frame>

## SIPREC and CTI Correlation and Association

In order to be able to associate the correct audio stream and the correct agent and agent desktop, ASAPP must associate the audio session and the CTI events of the particular agent.

ASAPP assigns voice agents a unique Agent ID and adds it to the SSO profile as a custom attribute. ASAPP will then map this to the Agent ID within ASAPP.

You configure the SBCs to set a unique call identifier, such as [UCID](#glossary "Glossary") (Avaya) or [GUID](#glossary "Glossary")/GUCID (Cisco), etc. on inbound calls, which provides ASAPP the means to correlate the individual SIPREC stream with the CTI events of the correct agent.

The SBCs will initiate a SIPREC session INVITE for each new call. With SIPREC, the customer SBC and the ASAPP media gateway negotiate the media attributes via the [SDP](#glossary "Glossary") offer/answer exchange during the establishment of the session. The codec/s in use today are:

1. G.711
2. G.729

Traffic and load considerations:

* Total number of voice agents using ASAPP -\<total agent count>
* Maximum concurrently logged in agents \<max concurrent agent count>
* Maximum concurrent calls at each SBC pair -\<max number of current offered calls to SBC/s>
* Maximum calls per second at each SBC pair -\<max calls per second offered to the SBC>

### Load Balancing for ASAPP Media Gateway Proxies

In order to distribute traffic across all of the media gateway proxies, the SBCs load balance the SIPREC dialogs to the ASAPP MG Proxies. To facilitate this, you configure the SBCs with a proxy list that provides business continuity and enables the fail-over to the next available proxy if one of the proxies becomes unavailable.

Session Recording Group Example:

The customer data center SBCs use different orders for the media gateway proxy list.

Data Center 1:

1. MG Proxy #1
2. MG Proxy #2
3. MG Proxy #3

Data Center 2:

1. MG Proxy #3
2. MG Proxy #2
3. MG Proxy #1

## Media Failover and Survivability

### Session Border Controller (SBC) to Media Gateways (MG) and Proxies

* Typically unencrypted signaling and audio through a secure connection/private tunnel
  * You can encrypt the traffic in theory, but the SBC has costs and scale limitations associated with encrypting traffic, as well as cost increases to MGs as you will need more instances.
* ASAPP accepts SIPREC dialogs, but initially sets SDP media to "inactive," which pauses the audio while in the IVR and in queue.
  * The ASAPP media gateway will re-invite the session and re-negotiate the media parameters to resume the audio stream when the agent answers the call.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-d5da0e97-893d-32e0-3686-ab027d3132cf.png" />
</Frame>

* SIP RFC handles some level of packet loss and re-transmissions but if the SIP signal is lost, the SIPREC dialog will be torn down and the media will no longer be sent.
* Media is sent via UDP.
  * No retransmissions so packet loss or disconnects result in permanent loss of the audio.
* Proxies are transactionally stateless.
* No audio is ever sent to/through proxies, all audio goes directly to media gateways.
  * Proxies are no longer in the signal path after the first transaction.
* If a proxy fails or is disconnected, SBCs can "hunt" or failover to the next proxy in it's configuration.
  * No existing calls are impacted.
* If media gateways fail or are disconnected, the next SIP transaction will fail and the existing media stream (if resumed) will be sent via UDP to nothing (media is lost).
* Media gateways use regular SIP OPTIONS sent to static proxies that indicate if they are available and their current number of calls.
* Proxies use this active call load to evenly load balance to the least used media gateway.
  * As well as dynamically pick up when a media gateway is no longer available or new ones come online.
* Any inbound calls coming in over ISDN-PRI/TDM trunk facilities will not have associated SIPREC sessions, as these calls do not traverse the SBC.

### Media Gateways to ASAPP Voice Streamers

* Secure websocket initiated per stream (2 per call) to the ASAPP Voice Streamer
* Media gateways do not store media, all processing is done in memory.
* Packet loss can be tolerated a little with TCP retransmissions.
* Buffer overrun audio data in the media gateway is purged instantly (per stream).
* If a secure websocket connection is lost, the media gateway will attempt a limited number of reconnections and then fail.
* If a voice streamer fails, a media gateway will reconnect to a new streamer.
* If a media gateway fails, the SIPREC stream is lost and the SBC can no longer send audio for that group of calls.

## Integration

### API Integration

Integration to existing customer systems enable ASAPP to call for information from those systems to present to the agent, such as:

* customer profile information
* billing history/statements
* customer product purchases
* Knowledge Base

Integration also enables ASAPP to push information to those systems, such as disposition notes and account changes/updates.

ASAPP will work with you to determine use cases for each integration that will add value to the agent and customer experience.

### Custom Call Data from CTI Information

In many instances, CTI will carry end customer specific information about the end customer and the call. This may be in the form of [User-to-User Information (UUI)](#glossary "Glossary"), `Call Variables`, Custom `NamedVariables`, or Custom `KVList UserData`. ASAPP uses this data to provide more information to agents and admins. It may contain information that provides customer identity information, route codes, queue information, customer authentication status, IVR interactions/ outputs, or simply unique identifiers for further data lookup from APIs. ASAPP extracts the custom fields and leverages the data in real-time to provide agents as much information as possible as part of the initial part of the interaction.

Each environment is uniquely different and ASAPP needs to understand what data is available from the CTI events to maximize relevant data to the agent and for voice intelligence processing.

Examples:

**Avaya**

```json
UserToUserInfo: “10000002321489708161;verify=T;english;2012134581”
```

**Cisco**

```json
CallVariable1:10000002321489708161
CallVariable7:en-us
user.AuthDetect:87
```

**Genesys**

```json
userAccount:10000002321489708161
userLanguage:en
userFirstName:John
```

**Twilio**

```json
<Parameter name=”FirstName” value=”John”/>
<Parameter name=”AccountNum” value=”10000002321489708161”/>
<Parameter name=”Language” value=”English”/>
<Parameter name=”VerficationStatus” value=”True”/>
```

### SSO Integration

[Single Sign-On (SSO)](#glossary "Glossary") allows users to sign in to ASAPP using their existing corporate credentials. ASAPP supports [Security Assertion Markup Language](#glossary "Glossary") (SAML) 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) based authentication. ASAPP requires SSO integration to support implementation.

To enable the SSO integration, the customer must populate and pass the Agent Login ID as a custom attribute in the SAML payload. Then, when a user logs in to ASAPP and authenticates via the existing SSO mechanism, the Agent Login ID value is then passed to ASAPP via SAML assertion for subsequent CTI event correlation.

The ASAPP Voice Agent Desk supports role-based access. You can define a specific role for each user that will determine their permissions within the ASAPP platform. For example, you can define the "app-asappagentprod" role in the Active Directory to send to ASAPP via SAML for those specific users that should have access to ASAPP Voice Agent Desk only. You can define multiple roles for an agent, such as access to Voice Agent Desk, Digital Agent Desk, and Admin Desk. You must define roles for voice agents and supervisors and include them in the SAML payload as a custom attribute.

The table below provides examples of SAML user attributes.

## Call Flows

Once an inbound [Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)](#glossary "Glossary") call is connected to an agent, the agent may need to transfer or conference the customer in with another agent/skill group. It is important to identify and document these types of call flows, when the transcript and customer data needs to be provided to another agent due to a change in call state. Then ASAPP will test these call scenarios as part of the QA and UAT testing process.

These scenarios include:

* Cold Transfers
  * The agent transfers the call to a queue (or similar) but does not stay on the call.
* Warm Transfers
  * The agent talks to the receiving agent prior to completing the transfer, in order to prepare the agent with the context of the call/customer issue.
* Conferences
  * The agent conferences in another agent or supervisor and remains on the call.
* Other
  * Customer call back applications or other unique call flows.

## Speech Files for Model Training

To prepare for a production launch, ASAPP will train the speech models on the customer language and vocabulary, which will provide better transcription accuracy. ASAPP will use a set of customer call recordings from previous interactions.

You will need to provide ASAPP with a minimum of 1,000 hours of agent/customer dual-channel/speech separated media files in .wav format with a sample rate of 8000 and signed 16-bit [Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)](#glossary "Glossary") in order for ASAPP to train the speech recognition models.

* ASAPP will set up an SFTP site in our PCI zone to receive voice media files from you. You will provide an SSH public key and ASAPP will configure the SFTP location within S3.
  * ASAPP prefers that you redact the PCI data from the provided voice recordings. Regardless, ASAPP will use its media redaction technology to remove sensitive customer data (Credit Card Numbers and Social Security Numbers) from the recordings to the extent possible. In addition to the default redaction noted above, ASAPP can customize redaction criteria per your requirements and feature considerations.
* The unredacted voice media files will remain within the [PCI Zone](#glossary "Glossary").
* ASAPP will use a combination of automated and manual transcription to refine our speech models. Data that ASAPP shares with vendors goes through the redaction process described above and is transferred via secured mechanisms such as SFTP.

## Non-Production Lower Environments

As part of our implementation strategy, ASAPP will implement two lower environments for testing (UAT and QA) by both ASAPP and customer resources. It is important that the lower environments do not use production data, including the audio data, as it may contain PCI information or other customer information that you should not expose to the lower environments.

You can implement lower environments using a lab environment, or a production environment.

When using the production infrastructure to support the lower environments, ASAPP separates production traffic from the lower environment traffic. The lower environments will have dedicated inbound numbers and routing that will allow them to be isolated and provide the ability for ASAPP and the customer teams to fully test using non-production traffic.

As part of the environment's buildout, ASAPP will need a way to initiate and terminate test calls. The ASAPP team will use the same soft-client and tools used by agents to login as a voice agent, answer inbound test calls, and simulate the various call flows used within the customer contact center.

ASAPP proposes customers allocate two [Direct Inward Dialing](#glossary "Glossary") (DID)/ [Toll Free Number](#glossary "Glossary") (TFN) numbers, one for each of the two different test environments.

* Demo Environment - A lower environment used by both ASAPP and customers.
* Preprod Environment - A lower environment used by ASAPP QA for testing.

At the SBC level, you should configure the Demo and Preprod DID numbers with their own Session Recording Server (SRS), unique from the production SRS configuration. This will allow the test environments to always have SIPREC turned on, but not send excess/production traffic to ASAPP. This also allows the test environments to operate independently of production. With Oracle/Acme, you can accomplish this with session agents. For Avaya SBCE, you can accomplish this with End Point Flows.

ASAPP will have a separate set of media gateways and media gateway proxies for each environment to ensure traffic and data separation.

The lower environments (not PCI compliant) are for testing only and will not receive actual customer audio. The production environment is where ASAPP transcribes and redacts the audio in a PCI zone.

## Appendix A - Avaya Configuration Details

This section provides specific configuration details for the solution that leverages Avaya telephony infrastructure.

**Avaya Communication Manager**

* Set Avaya [Internet Protocol - Private Branch Exchange (IP-PBX)](#glossary "Glossary") SIP trunks to 'shared' to ensure the UCID is not reset by the PBX.
  * Change trunk-group x -> page 3 -> UUI Treatment:shared
* Set `SendtoASAI` parameter to 'yes.'
  * Change system-parameters features -> page 13 -> Send UCID to ASAI? Y
  * Add ASAPP voice agents to a new skill, one that is not used for queuing or routing.
  * Configure AES to monitor the new skill.
    * ASAPP will use the `cstaMonitorDevice` service to monitor the ACD skill.
    * ASAPP may also call `cstaMonitorCallsViaDevice` if more call data is needed.

**Avaya AES [TSAPI](#glossary "Glossary") configuration**

* Networking -> Ports -> TSAPI Ports
  * Enabled
  * TSAPI Service Port (450)
    * Firewalls will also need to allow these ports.

| **Connection Type** | **TCP Min Port** | **TCP Max Port** |
| :------------------ | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| unencrypted/TCP     | 1050             | 1065             |
| encrypted/TLS       | 1066             | 1081             |

* AES link to ASAPP connection provisioning
  * Provisioning of new ASAPP Voice skill for monitoring.

## Appendix B - Cisco Configuration Details

This section provides specific configuration details for the solution that leverages Cisco telephony infrastructure.

**Cisco CTI Server configuration**

* ASAPP will connect with the `CTI_SERVICE_ALL_EVENTS`
  * You will need the Preferred `ClientID` (identifier for ASAPP) and `ClientPassword` (if not null) to send the `OPEN_REQ` message.
* Ports 42027 (side A) and 43027 (side B)
  * Instance number if not 0 will increase these ports
  * Firewalls will also need to allow these ports
* `CallVariable`1-10 Definitions/usages
* Custom `NamedVariables` and `NamedArrays` Definitions/usages
* Events currently used by ASAPP:
  * `OPEN_REQ`
  * `OPEN_CONF`
  * `SYSTEM`
  * `AGENT_STATE`
  * `AGENT_PRE_CALL`
  * `BEGIN_CALL`
  * `CALL_DATA_UPDATE`
  * `CALL_CLEARED`
  * `END_CALL`

## Appendix C - Oracle (Acme) Session Border Controller

In order to provide the correlation between the SIPREC session and specific CTI events, ASAPP will use the following approach:

* Session Border Controller
  * Configure the SBC to create an Avaya UCID (universal call identifier) in the SIP header.
    * UCID generation is a native feature for Oracle/Acme Packet session border controller platforms.
      * [Oracle SBC UCID Admin](https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/communications/enterprise-session-border-controller/8.4.0/configuration/universal-call-identifier-spl#GUID-97456BB9-264F-4290-AB92-8C60F64B9734)
* In the Oracle (Acme Packet) SBCs, load balancing across the ASAPP Media Gateway Proxies requires the use of static IP addresses versus the use of dynamic hostnames.
  * SBC Settings for Media Gateway Proxies - Production and Lower Environments:
    * Transport = TCP
    * SIP OPTIONS = disabled
    * Load Balancing strategy = "hunt"
    * Session-recording-required = disabled
    * Port = 5070

# Web App Settings
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings



This section details the various properties you can provide to the Chat SDK.

These properties are used for various display, feature, and application settings.

Before utilizing these settings, make sure you've [integrated the ASAPP SDK](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start "Web Quick Start") script on your page.

Once you've integrated the SDK with your site, you can use the [JavaScript API](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api "Web JavaScript API") for applying these settings.

The properties available to the ASAPP Chat SDK include:

* [APIHostName](#apihostname "APIHostName")
* [AppId](#appid "AppId")
* [ContextProvider](#contextprovider "ContextProvider")
* [CustomerId](#customerid "CustomerId")
* [Display](#display "Display")
* [Intent](#intent "Intent")
* [Language](#language)
* [onLoadComplete](#onloadcomplete "onLoadComplete")
* [RegionCode](#regioncode "RegionCode")
* [Sound](#sound "Sound")
* [UserLoginHandler](#userloginhandler-11877 "UserLoginHandler")

Each property has three attributes:

* Key - provides the name of the property that you can set.
* Available APIs - lists the [JavaScript APIs](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api "Web JavaScript API") that the property is accepted on.
* Value Type - describes the primitive type of value required.

## APIHostName

* Key: `APIHostName`
* Available APIs: [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'")
* Value Type: `String`

Sets the ASAPP APIHostName for connecting customers with customer support.

* Value Type: `String`

The unique identifier for an authenticated customer. This value is typically a customer's login name or account ID. If setting a **`CustomerId`** you must also provide a [ContextProvider ](#contextprovider "ContextProvider")property to pass along their access token and any other required authentication properties.

## Display

* Key: `Display`
* Available APIs: [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'")
* Value Type: `Object`

The `Display` setting allows you to customize the presentation aspects of the Chat SDK. The setting is an object that contains each of the customization's you wish to provide.

If set to a non-supported value the Chat SDK will display in a generic, non-branded experience.

### PrimaryColor

* Key: `PrimaryColor`
* Value Type: `String`
* Accepted Values: `Color Keyword`,`RGB hex value`

Customizes the primary color of Proactive Messages and [Chat Instead](/messaging-platform/integrations/chat-instead/web "Web").

This will be the background color of the [Chat SDK Badge](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-customization#badge "Badge") if the BadgeColor is not provided.

## Intent

* Key: `Intent`
* Available APIs: [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#-load- "'load'")
* Value Type: `String`

The intent code that you wish for a user's conversation to initialize with. The setting takes an object, with a required key of `Code`. `Code` accepts a string.

Your team and your ASAPP Implementation Manager will determine the available values.

```javascript
ASAPP('load', {
    APIHostname: 'example-co-api.asapp.com',
    AppId: 'example-co',
    Intent: {
        Code: 'PAYBILL'
    }
});
```

## Language

* Key: `Language`
* Available APIs: [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'")
* Value Type: `String`

By Default, the SDK will use English (`en`). You can override this by setting the `Language` property. It accepts a value of:

* `en` for English
* `fr` for French
* `es` for Spanish

ASAPP does not support switching languages mid-session, after a conversation has started. You must set a language before starting a conversation.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript English
  ASAPP('load', {
      APIHostname: 'example-co-api.asapp.com',
      AppId: 'example-co',
      Language: 'en'
  });
  ```

  ```javascript French
  ASAPP('load', {
      APIHostname: 'example-co-api.asapp.com',
      AppId: 'example-co',
      Language: 'fr'
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## onLoadComplete

* Key: `onLoadComplete`
* Available APIs: [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'")
* Value Type: `Function`

A callback that is triggered once the Chat SDK has finished initializing. This is useful when attaching events via the [Action API](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#action-on-or-off "action: 'on' or 'off'") or whenever you need to perform custom actions to the SDK after it has loaded.

The provided method receives a single argument as a boolean value. If the value is `false`, then the page is not configured to display under the [ASAPP Trigger feature](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-features#triggers "Triggers"). If the value is `true`, then the Chat SDK has loaded and finished appending to your DOM.

```
ASAPP('load', {
    APIHostname: 'example-co-api.asapp.com',
    AppId: 'example-co',
    onLoadComplete: function (isDisplayingChat) {
        console.log('ASAPP Loaded');
        if (isDisplayingChat) {
            ASAPP('on', 'message:received', handleMessageReceivedEvent);
        } else {
            console.log('ASAPP not enabled on this page');
        }
    }
});
```

## RegionCode

* Key: `RegionCode`
* Available APIs: [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'")
* Value Type: `String`

Localizes the Chat SDK with a certain region. It accepts a value from the [ISO 3166 alpha-2 country codes](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#home) representing the country you wish to localize.

## Sound

* Key: `Sound`
* Available APIs: [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'")
* Value Type: `Boolean`

When set to `true`, users will receive an audio notification when they receive a message in the chat log. This defaults to `false`.

## UserLoginHandler

* Key: `UserLoginHandler`
* Available APIs: [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'")
* Value Type: `Function`

The `UserLoginHandler` allows you to provide a means of authentication so a user may access account information via the ASAPP Chat SDK. When the Chat SDK determines that a user is unauthorized, a "Log In" button appears. When the user clicks that button, the Chat SDK will call the method you provided. See the [Authentication](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-authentication "Web Authentication") page for options on how you can authenticate your customers. Note: If you do not provide a `UserLoginHandler`, a user will not be able to transition from an anonymous to an authorized session.

When the Chat SDK calls the `UserLoginHandler`, it provides a single argument.

The argument is an object and contains various session information that may be useful to your integration. You and your Implementation Manager determine the information provided.

It may contain things such as [CompanySubdivision](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider#company-subdivisions "Company Subdivisions"), [ExternalSessioninformation](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider#session-information "Session Information"), and more.

```javascript
ASAPP('load', {
    APIHostname: 'example-co-api.asapp.com',
    AppId: 'example-co',
    UserLoginHandler: function (data) {
        if (data.CompanySubdivision === 'chocolatiers') {
            // Synchronous login
            window.open('/login?makers=tempering')
        } else {
            // Get Customer Id and access_token ...
            var CustomerId = 'Retrieved customer ID';
            var access_token = 'Retrieved access token';
            // Call SetCustomer with retrieved access_token, CustomerId, and ContextProvider
            ASAPP('setCustomer', {
                CustomerId: CustomerId,
                ContextProvider: function (callback) {
                    var context = {
                        Auth: {
                            Token: access_token
                        }
                    };
                    callback(context);
                }
            });
        }
    }
});
```


# Web Authentication
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-authentication



This section details the process for authenticating your users to the ASAPP Chat SDK.

* [Authenticating at Page Load](#authenticating-at-page-load "Authenticating at Page Load")
* [Authenticating Asynchronously](#authenticating-asynchronously "Authenticating Asynchronously")
* [Using the 'UserLoginHandler' Method](#using-the-userloginhandler-method "Using the 'UserLoginHandler' Method")

Before getting started, make sure you've [embedded the ASAPP Chat SDK](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start#1-embed-the-script "1. Embed the Script") into your site.

<Note>
  Your site is responsible for the entirety of the user authentication process. This includes the presentation of an interface for login and the maintenance of a session, and for the retrieval and formatting of context data about that user. Please read the section on using the [Authentication with the ContextProvider](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider#authentication "Authentication") to understand how you can pass authorization information to the Chat SDK.
</Note>

Once your site has authenticated a user, you can securely pass that authentication forward to the ASAPP Chat environment by making certain calls to the ASAPP Chat SDK (more on those calls below). Your user can then be authenticated both on your web site and in the ASAPP Chat Environment, enabling them to execute within the ASAPP Chat use cases that require authentication.

ASAPP provides two methods for authenticating a user to the ASAPP Chat SDK.

* You can proactively [authenticate your user at page load](#authenticating-at-page-load "Authenticating at Page Load").
* You can [authenticate your user midway through a session](#authenticating-asynchronously "Authenticating Asynchronously") using the [SetCustomer API](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#setcustomer "'setCustomer'").

With rare exceptions, you must also configure [UserLoginHandler](#using-the-userloginhandler-method "Using the 'UserLoginHandler' Method") to enable ASAPP to handle cases where a user requires authentication or re-authentication in the midst of a chat session (e.g., if a user's authentication credentials expire during a chat session.)

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-8ade9d85-5d88-c79d-ac59-de17e894032d.png" />
</Frame>

## Authenticating at Page Load

If a user who is already authenticated with your site requests a page that includes ASAPP chat functionality, you can proactively authenticate that user to the ASAPP SDK at page load time. This allows an authenticated user who initiates a chat session to have immediate access to their account details without having to login again.

To authenticate a user to the ASAPP Chat SDK on page load, use the ASAPP [Load API](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'") providing both [ContextProvider](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#contextprovider "ContextProvider") and [CustomerId](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#customerid "CustomerId") as additional keys in the [Load method](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'").

For example:

```javascript
<script>
ASAPP('load', {
    APIHostname: 'examplecompanyapi.asapp.com',
    AppId: 'examplecompany',
    CustomerId: 'UserName123',
    ContextProvider: function (callback) {
        var context = {
            Auth: {
                Body: {
                    token_expiry: '1530021131',
                    token_scope: 'store'
                },
                Token: '3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f'
            },
        };
        callback(context);
    }
});
</script>
```

The sample above initializes the ASAPP Chat SDK with your user's `CustomerId` and a `ContextProvider` incorporating that user's `Auth`.

When a user opens the ASAPP Chat SDK, they will already be authenticated to the chat client and can access account information within the chat without being asked to login again.

## Authenticating Asynchronously

If a user's authentication credentials are not available at page load time, you can authenticate asynchronously using the ASAPP [SetCustomer](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#setcustomer "'setCustomer'") API.

After you've retrieved your user's credentials, you can call the API to authenticate that user with the ASAPP Chat SDK mid-session.

You might want to asynchronously authenticate a user to the ASAPP Chat SDK when (for example) that user has just completed a login flow, or if their credentials are retrieved after the page initially loads, or if a session expires and the user needs to reauthenticate.

The following sample snippet shows how to call the SetCustomer API:

```javascript
<script>
ASAPP('setCustomer', {
    CustomerId: 'UserName123',
    ContextProvider: function (callback) {
        var context = {
            Auth: {
                Token: '3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f'
            },
        };
        callback(context);
    }
});
</script>
```

Once you call the [SetCustomer](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#setcustomer "'setCustomer'") method is called, and as long as the provided `Auth` information remains valid on your backend, any ASAPP Chat SDK actions that require authentication will be properly authenticated.

<Note>
  The SetCustomer method is typically called as part of the [UserLoginHandler](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#userloginhandler-11877 "UserLoginHandler").

  See the section on [Using the 'UserLoginHandler' Method](#using-the-userloginhandler-method "Using the 'UserLoginHandler' Method") for a complete picture of how you may want to authenticate a user during an ASAPP Chat SDK session.
</Note>

## Using the 'UserLoginHandler' Method

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-4699ebd3-525e-b694-a3b6-1e329e71fbbd.png" />
</Frame>

```javascript
<script>
ASAPP('load', {
    APIHostname: 'examplecompanyapi.asapp.com',
    AppId: 'examplecompany',
    UserLoginHandler: function () {
        /*
            Use case #1
            1. Redirect the user to a login page
            2. User logs in
            3. Once user is redirected, use `ASAPP('load', ...)`
               API to set authorization at page load
            Use case #2
            1. Show a login modal
            2. Authenticate the user asynchronously
            3. Retrieve and set the customer's ID and access token
               with `ASAPP('setCustomer', ...)`
        */
    }
});
</script>
```


# Web ContextProvider
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider



This section details the various ways you can use the ASAPP ContextProvider with the Chat SDK API. Before using the ContextProvider, make sure you've [integrated the ASAPP SDK](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start "Web Quick Start") script on your page.

The ASAPP `ContextProvider` is used for passing various information about your users or their sessions to the Chat SDK. It is a key that may be set in the [Load and SetCustomer](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api) APIs. The key must be assigned a function that will receive two arguments.

The first argument is a `callback` function. The second argument is a `needsRefresh` boolean indicating whether or not the authorization information needs to be refreshed.

The `ContextProvider` is called whenever the user types in the Chat SDK.

## 'Callback'

After you've retrieved all the context needed for a user, call the `callback` argument with your context object as the sole argument. This will pass your context object to the ASAPP Chat SDK.

## 'needsRefresh'

The `needsRefresh` argument returns a boolean value indicating whether or not your user's authorization has expired.

```javascript
function contextProviderHandler(callback, needsRefresh) {
    var contextObject = Object.assign(
        {},
        yourGetAnalyticsMethod(),
        yourGetSessionMethod(),
        yourGetAuthenticationMethod()
    );
    if (needsRefresh) {
        Object.assign(contextObject.Auth,
            getUpdatedAuthorization()
        );
    }
    callback(contextObject);
}
ASAPP('setCustomer', {
    CustomerId: yourGetCustomerIdMethod(),
    ContextProvider: contextProviderHandler
}
)
\
;
```

## Authentication

The `ContextProvider` plays an important role in authorizing your users with the ASAPP Chat SDK. Whether your users are always authenticated or transitioning from an anonymous to integrated use case, you must use the ContextProvider's `Auth` key to provide a user's authorization.

<Note>
  Your site is responsible for retrieving and providing all authorization information. Once provided to ASAPP, your user will be allowed secure access to any integrated use cases.
</Note>

Along with providing a [CustomerId](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#customerid "CustomerId"), you'll need to provide any request body with information, cookies, headers, or access tokens required for ASAPP to authorize with your systems.

You may provide this information using the `Auth` key and the following set of nested properties:

```javascript
function contextProviderHandler(callback, needsRefresh) {
    var contextObject = {
        // Auth key provided to the ContextProvider
        Auth: {
            Body: {
                customParam: 'value'
            },
            Cookies: {
                AuthCookie: 'authCookieValue'
            },
            Headers: {
                'X-Custom-Header': 'value'
            },
            Scopes: ['paybill'],
            Token: 'b34r3r...'
        }
    };
    callback(contextObject);
}
```

Each key within the `Auth` object is optional, but you must provide any necessary information for your authenticated users.

* The `Body`, `Cookies`, and `Headers` keys all accept an object containing any number of key:value pairs.
* The `Scopes` key accepts an array of strings defining which services may be updated with the provided token.
* The `Token` key accepts a single access token string.

Please see the [Authentication](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-authentication "Web Authentication") section for full details on using the `ContextProvider` for authenticating your users.

## Customer Info

You may assign analytic data and add other customer information to a user's Chat SDK interactions by using the `CustomerInfo` key. The key is a child of the context object and contains a series of key:value pairs.

Your page is responsible for defining and setting the keys you would like to track. You may define and pass along as many keys as you would like.

You must discuss and agree upon the attribute names with your Implementation Manager.

**CustomerInfo:**

* Key: `CustomerInfo`
* Value Type: `Object`

The object should contain a set of key:value pairs that you wish to provide as analytics or customer information. The value of each key must be a string.

<Warning>
  **WARNING ABOUT SENSITIVE DATA**

  Do NOT send sensitive data via `CustomerInfo`, `custom_params`, or `customer_params`. For more information, [click here](/security/warning-about-customerinfo-and-sensitive-data "Warning about CustomerInfo and Sensitive Data").
</Warning>

A user does not need to be authenticated in order to provide analytics information. The following code snippet shows the `CustomerInfo` key being used to pass along analytics data.

```javascript
function contextProviderHandler(callback, needsRefresh) {
    var contextObject = {
        CustomerInfo: {
            // Your own key: value pairs
            category: 'payment',
            action: 'ASAPP',
            parent_page: 'Pay my Bill'
        }
    };
    // Return the callback
    callback(contextObject);
}
ASAPP('load', {
    APIHostname: '[API_HOSTNAME]',
    AppId: '[APP_ID]',
    ContextProvider: contextProviderHandler
});
```

## Session Information

The `ContextProvider` may be used for passing existing session information along to the Chat SDK. This is for connecting a user's page session with their SDK session.

You may provide two keys---`ExternalSessionId `and `ExternalSessionType`---for connecting session information. The value of each key is at your discretion.

A user does not need to be authenticated in order to provide session information.

### ExternalSessionId

* Key: `ExternalSessionId`
* Value Type: `String`
* Example Value: `'j6oAOxCWZh...'`
  Your user's unique session identifier. This information can be used for joining your session IDs with ASAPP's session IDs.

### ExternalSessionType

* Key: `ExternalSessionType`
* Value Type: `String`
* Example Value:`'visitID'`

A descriptive label of the type of identifier being passed via the `ExternalSessionId`.

## Company Subdivisions

If your company has multiple entities segmented under a single AppId, you may use the `ContextProvider` to pass the entity information along to the Chat SDK.

To do so, provide the optional `CompanySubdivision`key with a value of your subdivision's identifier. The identifier value will be determined in coordination with your ASAPP Implementation Manager.

### CompanySubdivision

* Key: `CompanySubdivision`
* Value Type: `Object`
* Example Value: `'divisionId'`

An object containing a set of key:value pairs that you wish to provide as analytics information. The value of each key must be a string.

## Segments

If your company needs to group users at a more granular level than [AppId](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#appid "AppId") or [CompanySubdivision](#company-subdivisions "Company Subdivisions"), you may use the `Segments` key to apply labels to your reports.

Each key you provide allows you to filter your reporting dashboard by those values.

### Segments

* Key: `Segments`
* Value Type: `Array`
* Example Value: \[`'north america'`, `'usa',``'northeast'`]

The key value must be an array containing a set of strings.


# Web Customization
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-customization



Once properly installed and configured, the ASAPP Chat SDK embeds two snippets of HTML markup into your host web page:

* [Chat SDK Badge](#badge "Badge")
* [Chat SDK iframe](#iframe "iframe")

This section details how these elements function. In addition, it describes how to [Customize the Chat UI](#customize-the-chat-ui "Customize the Chat UI").

## Badge

The ASAPP Chat SDK Badge is the default interface element your customers can use to open or close the ASAPP Chat iframe.

When a user clicks on this element, it will trigger the [ASAPP('Show')](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#show "'show'") or [ASAPP('Hide')](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#hide"'hide'") APIs.

This toggles the display of the ASAPP Chat SDK iframe.

### Badge Markup

By default. the ASAPP Chat SDK Badge is inserted into your markup as a lightweight `button` element, with a click behavior that toggles the display of the [iframe](#iframe "iframe") element. ASAPP recommends that you use the default badge element so you can take advantage of our latest features as they become available.

However, if you wish to customize the badge, you can do so by either manipulating the CSS associated with the badge, or by hiding/removing the element from your DOM and toggling the display of the iframe using your own custom element. See the [Badge Styling](#asapp-badge-styling "ASAPP Badge Styling") section below for more details on customizing the appearance of the ASAPP Chat SDK Badge.

```json
<button id="asapp-chat-sdk-badge" 
    class="asappChatSDKBadge examplecompany">
    <svg class="icon">...</svg>
    <svg class="icon">...</svg>
</button>
```

### ASAPP Badge Styling

You can customize the ASAPP Chat SDK Badge with CSS using the ID `#asapp-chat-sdk-badge` or classname `.asappChatSDKBadge` selectors. ASAPP recommends that you use [BadgeColor](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#display "Display").

The following snippet is an example of how you might use these selectors to customize the element to meet your brand needs:

```css
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge {
    background-color: rebeccapurple;
}
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge:focus,
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge:hover,
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge:active {
    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(102, 51, 153, .25);
    background-color: #fff;
}
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge .icon {
    fill: #fff;
}
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge:focus .icon,
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge:hover .icon,,
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge:active .icon {
    fill: rebeccapurple;
}
```

### Custom Badge

You can hide the ASAPP Chat SDK Badge and provide your own interface for opening the ASAPP Chat SDK iframe. 

* Set [BadgeType](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#display "Display") to none.
* Call [`ASAPP('show')`](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#show "'show'") and/or [`ASAPP('hide')`](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#hide "'hide'")  when your custom badge is clicked to open/close the iframe.
* In order to ensure that the Chat SDK is ready, ASAPP recommends to display your custom badge disabled/loading state at first and then utilize [onLoadComplete](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#onloadcomplete "onLoadComplete") to enable it.

**Example:**

In the code example below, the 'Chat with us' button is not clickable until you enable it using onLoadComplete.

Once enabled, a user can click the button to open the ASAPP SDK iframe.

Custom Button:

```html
<button
    id="asapp-custom-button"
    onclick="window.ASAPP(`Show`)"
    disabled
 >
  Chat with us
 </button>
```

Load config example:

```json
<script>
    ASAPP('load', {
                <other configs>…,
                onLoadComplete: shouldDisplayWebChat => {
                    if(shouldDisplayWebChat){
                        document.getElementById('asapp-custom-button').disabled = false;
                    }
                },
 });
</script>   
```

## iframe

The ASAPP Chat SDK iframe contains the interface that your customers will use to interact with the ASAPP platform.

The element is populated with ASAPP-provided functionality and styled elements, but the iframe itself is customizable to your brand's needs.

### iframe Markup

The SDK iframe is instantiated as a lightweight `<iframe>` element whose contents are delivered by the ASAPP platform.

ASAPP recommends using the default iframe sizing, positioning, and functionality so you can take advantage of our latest features as they become available.

However, if you wish to customize this element you can do so by applying functionality and styling to the frame itself. See the iframe Styling section below for details on available customizations.

The following code snippet is an example of the ASAPP Chat SDK iframe markup.

```json
<iframe id="asapp-chat-sdk-iframe"
    title="Customer Support | Chat Window"
    class="asappChatSDKIFrame" frameborder="0"
    src="https://sdk.asapp.com/...">
    ...
</iframe>
```

### iframe Styling

You can customize the ASAPP Chat SDK iframe by using the ID `#asapp-chat-sdk-iframe` or classname `.asappChatSDKIFrame` selectors.

The following snippet is an example of how you may want to use these selectors to customize the element to your brand.

```json
@media only screen and (min-width: 415px) {
    #asapp-chat-sdk-iframe {
        box-shadow: 0 2px 12px 0 rgba(35, 6, 60, .05),
            0 2px 49px 0 rgba(102, 51, 153, .25);
    }
}
```

<Note>
  Modifying the sizing or positioning of the iframe is currently not supported. Change those properties at your own risk; a moved or resized iframe is not guaranteed to work with upcoming releases of the ASAPP platform
</Note>

## Customize the Chat UI

ASAPP will customize the Chat SDK iframe User Interface (UI) in close collaboration with design and business stakeholders. ASAPP will work within your branding guidelines to apply an appropriate color palette, logo, and typeface. There are two particularly technical requirements that we can assess early on to provide a more seamless delivery of requirements:

### 1. Chat Header Logo

The ASAPP SDK Team will embed your logo into the Chat SDK Header. Please provide your logo in the following format:

* SVG format
* Does not exceed 22 pixels in height
* Does not exceed 170 pixels in width
* Should not contain animations
* Should not contain filter effects

If you follow the above guidelines your logo will:

* display at the most optimal size for responsive devices
* sit well within the overall design
* display properly

### 2. Custom Typefaces

Using a custom typeface within the ASAPP Chat SDK requires detailed technical requirements to ensure that the client is performant, caching properly, and displaying the expected fonts. For the best experience, you should provide ASAPP with the following:

* The font should be available in any of the following formats: WOFF2, WOFF, OTF, TTF, and EOT.
* The font should be hosted in the same place that your own site's custom typeface is hosted.
* The same hosted font files should have an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` that allows `sdk.asapp.com` or `*`.
* The files should have proper cache-control headers as well as GZIP compression. For more information on web font performance enhancements, ASAPP recommends the article: [Web Font Optimization](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/webfont-optimization), published by Google and Ilya Grigorik.
* You acknowledge that you will provide ASAPP with the URLs for each of the hosted font formats for use in a CSS @font-face declaration, hosted on sdk.asapp.com.
* If your font becomes unavailable for display, ASAPP will default to using [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato), then Arial, Helvetica, or a default sans-serif font.


# Web Examples
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-examples



This section provides a few common integration scenarios with the ASAPP Chat SDK.

Before continuing, make sure you've [integrated the ASAPP SDK](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start "Web Quick Start") script on your page. You must have the initial script available before utilizing any of the examples below. Also, be sure that you have a [Trigger](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-features#triggers "Triggers") enabled for the page(s) you wish to display the Chat SDK.

* [Basic Integration (no Authentication)](#basic-integration-no-authentication "Basic Integration (no Authentication)")
* [Basic Integration (With Authentication)](#basic-integration-with-authentication "Basic Integration (With Authentication)")
* [Customizing the Interface](#customizing-the-interface "Customizing the Interface")
* [Advanced Integration](#advanced-integration "Advanced Integration")

## Basic Integration (no Authentication)

The most basic integrations are ones with no customizations to the ASAPP interface and no integrated use cases. If your company is simply providing an un-authed user experience, an integration like the one below may suffice.

ee the [App Settings](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings "Web App Settings") page for details on the [APIHostname](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#apihostname "APIHostName") and [AppId](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#appid "AppId") settings. The following code snippet is an example of a non-authenticated integration with the ASAPP Chat SDK.

```json
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    ASAPP('load', {
        APIHostname: 'example-co.api.asapp.com',
        AppId: 'example-co'
    });
});
```

With the above information set, a user will be able to access integrated use cases. If their session or token information has expired, then the user will be presented with a "Sign In" button. Once the user clicks the Sign In button, the Chat SDK will call your provided UserLoginHandler, allowing them to authorize. Here's a sample of what the Sign In button looks like.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-efa8b7d8-cb74-a362-73a8-5af1cd58d9e5.png" />
</Frame>

## Basic Integration (With Authentication)

Integrating the Chat SDK with authenticated users requires the addition of the `CustomerId`, `ContextProvider`, and `UserLoginHandler` keys.

See the [App Settings](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings "Web App Settings") page for more detailed information on their usage. With each of these keys set, a user will be able to access integrated use cases or be capable of logging in if they are not already.

The following code snippet is an example of providing user credentials for allowing a user to enter integrated use cases.

```json
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    ASAPP('load', {
        APIHostname: 'example-co.api.asapp.com',
        AppId: 'example-co',
        CustomerId: 'hashed-customer-identifier',
        ContextProvider: function (callback, tokenIsExpired) {
            var context = {
                Auth: {
                    Token: 'secure-session-user-token'
                }
            };
            callback(context);
        },
        // If a user's token expires or their user credentials
        // are not available, handle their login path
        UserLoginHandler: function () {
            window.location.href = '/login';
        }
    });
});
```

With the above information set, a user will be able to access integrated use cases. If their session or token information has expired, then the user will be presented with a "Sign In" button.

Once the user clicks the Sign In button, the Chat SDK will call your provided `UserLoginHandler`, allowing them to authorize.

Here's a sample of what the Sign In button looks like.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-cdd86419-d919-b30f-d58f-58a236ccb57e.png" />
</Frame>

## Customizing the Interface

The Chat SDK offers a few basic keys for customizing the interface to your liking.

The `Display` key enables you to perform those customizations as needed. Please see the [Display Settings](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#display "Display") section for detailed information on each of the available keys.

The following code snippet shows how to add the Display key to your integration to customize the display settings of the Chat SDK.

```json
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    ASAPP('load', {
        APIHostname: 'example-co.api.asapp.com',
        AppId: 'example-co',
        Display: {
            Align: 'left',
            AlwaysShowMinimize: true,
            BadgeColor: '#36393A',
            BadgeText: 'Chat With Us',
            BadgeType: 'tray',
            FrameDraggable: true,
            FrameStyle: 'sideBar'
        }
    });
});
```

For cases in which you have more specific styling needs, you may utilize the available IDs or classnames for targeting and customizing the Chat SDK elements with CSS.

These selectors are stable and can be used to target the ASAPP Badge and iFrame for specific styling needs.

The following code snippet provides a CSS example showcasing a few advanced style changes.

```json
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge,
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge,
#asapp-chat-sdk-badge {
    border-radius: 25px;
    bottom: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #fff, 0 0 0 4px #36393A;
}
#asapp-chat-sdk-iframe {
    border-radius: 0;
}
```

With the above customizations in place, the Chat SDK Badge will look like the following.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-ef02c2ea-81d6-a600-7880-0f66c789599d.png" />
</Frame>

## Advanced Integration

Here's a more robust example showing how to utilize most of the ASAPP Chat SDK settings.

In the examples below we will define a few helper methods, then pass those helpers to the [Load](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'") or [SetCustomer](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#setcustomer "'setCustomer'") APIs.

The following example showcases a [ContextProvider](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider "Web ContextProvider") that sets some basic session information, then sets any available user authentication information. Once that information is retrieved, it passes the prepared context to the `callback` so that ASAPP can process each Chat SDK request.

The following code snippet is a ContextProvider example utilizing session expiration conditionals.

```javascript
function asappContextProvider (callback, tokenIsExpired, sessionInfo) {
    var context = {
        CustomerInfo: {
            Region: 'north-america',
            ViewingProduct: 'New Smartphone',
        }
    };
    if (tokenIsExpired || !sessionInfo) {
        sessionInfo = retrieveSessionInfo();
    };
    if (sessionInfo) {
        context.Auth = {
            Cookies: {
                'X-User-Header': sessionInfo.cookies.userValue
            },
            Token: sessionInfo.access_token
        };
    }
    callback(context);
}
```

The next example shows conditional logic for logging a user in on single or multi-page application. You'll likely only need to handle one of the cases in your application.

If a user enters a use case they are not authorized for, they will be presented with a "Sign In" button within the SDK.

When the user clicks that link, it will trigger your provided [UserLoginHandler](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#userloginhandler "UserLoginHandler") so you can allow the user to authenticate.

The following code snippet shows a UserLoginHandler utilizing page redirection or modals to log a user in.

```javascript
function asappUserLoginHandler () {
    if (isSinglePageApp) {
        displayUserLoginModal()
            .then(function (customer, sessionInfo) {
                ASAPP('SetCustomer', {
                    CustomerId: customer,
                    ContextProvider: function (callback, tokenIsExpired) {
                        asappContextProvider(callback, tokenIsExpired, sessionInfo)
                    }
                });
            })
    } else {
        window.location.href = '/login';
    }
}
```

The next helper defines the [onLoadComplete](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#onloadcomplete "onLoadComplete") handler.

It is used for preparing any additional logic you wish to tie to ASAPP or your own page functionality. The below example checks whether the Chat SDK loaded via a [Trigger](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-features#triggers "Triggers") (via the `isDisplayingChat` argument).

If it's configured to display, it prepares some event bindings through the [Action API](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#action-on-or-off "action: 'on' or 'off'") which in turn call an example metrics service.

The following code snippet shows an `onLoadComplete` handler being used with the isDisplayingChat conditional and Action API.

```javascript
function asappOnLoadComplete (isDisplayingChat) {
    if (isDisplayingChat) {
        // Chat SDK has loaded and exists on the page
        document.body.classList.add('chat-sdk-loaded');
        var customerId = retrieveCurrentSessionOrUserId();
        ASAPP('on', 'issue:new', function (event) {
            metricService('set', 'chat:action', {
                actionName: event.type,
                customerId: customerId,
                externalCustomerId: event.detail.customerId,
                issueId: event.detail.issueId
            })
        });
        ASAPP('on', 'message:received', function (event) {
            metricService('set', 'chat:action', {
                actionName: event.type,
                customerId: customerId,
                externalCustomerId: event.detail.customerId,
                isLiveChat: event.detail.isLiveChat,
                issueId: event.detail.issueId,
                senderType: event.detail.senderType
            })
        });
    } else {
        // Chat SDK is not configured to display on this page.
        // See Display Settings: Triggers documentation
    }
}
```

Finally, we tie everything together. The example below shows a combination of adding the above helper functions to the ASAPP [Load API](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'").

It also combines many of the [App Settings](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings "Web App Settings") available to you and your integration.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    var customerId = retrieveCustomerIdentifier();
    ASAPP('load', {
        APIHostname: 'example-co.api.asapp.com',
        AppId: 'example-co',
        Display: {
            Align: 'left',
            AlwaysShowMinimize: true,
            BadgeColor: 'rebeccapurple',
            BadgeText: 'Chat With Us',
            BadgeType: 'tray',
            FrameDraggable: true,
            FrameStyle: 'sideBar',
            Identity: 'subsidiary-branding'
        },
        Intent: {
            Code: 'PAYBILL'
        },
        RegionCode: 'US',
        Sound: true,
        CustomerId: customerId,
        ContextProvider: asappContextProvider,
        UserLoginHandler: asappUserLoginHandler,
        onLoadComplete: asappOnLoadComplete
    });
});
```


# Web Features
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-features



This section describes various features that are unique to the ASAPP Web SDK:

* [Triggers](#triggers "Triggers")
* [Deeplinks](#deeplinks-11865 "Deeplinks")

In addition, please see [Chat Instead](/messaging-platform/integrations/chat-instead/web "Web").

## Triggers

A Trigger is an ASAPP feature that allows you to specify which pages display the ASAPP Chat UI. You may choose to show the ASAPP Chat UI on all pages where the ASAPP Chat SDK is [embedded and loaded](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start "Web Quick Start"), or on just a subset of those pages.

<Note>
  You must enable at least one Trigger in order for the ASAPP Chat UI to display anywhere on your site. Until you define at least one Trigger, the ASAPP Chat UI will not display on your site.
</Note>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-3a889a32-4401-ec1b-0f96-b73a2243d09a.png" />
</Frame>

Once you've [embedded](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start#1-embed-the-script "1. Embed the Script") and [loaded](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api#load "'load'") the Chat SDK on your web pages, ASAPP will determine whether or not to display the Chat UI on the user's current URL.

URLs that are enabled for displaying the UI are configured by a feature known as Triggers.

<Note>
  You will need to be set up as a user of the ASAPP Admin Control Panel in order to make the changes described below.

  Once you are granted permissions, you may utilize the Triggers as a means of specifying which pages are eligible to show the ASAPP Chat UI.
</Note>

### Creating a Trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-7f1adc53-5b8e-a1f0-2e83-7d85a4b59989.png" />
</Frame>

1. Visit the **Admin > Triggers** section of your Admin Desk.
2. Click the **Add +** button from the Triggers settings page.
3. In the **URL Link** field, enter the URL for the page where you would like to display the ASAPP Chat UI. (See the **Types of Triggers** section below for some example values.)
4. Click **Next >**.
5. Give the Trigger a display name. (Display names are used only on the Triggers settings page to help you organize and manage your triggers.)
6. Click **Save**.
7. You should now see the new entry on your Trigger settings page.
8. Visit the newly configured page on your site to double-check that the ASAPP Chat UI is loading or hiding as you expect.

### Types of Triggers

You may finely control the display of the ASAPP Chat UI on your site by adding as many Triggers as you like.

Triggers can be defined in two different ways: as **Wildcard** and as **Single-Page Triggers**.

#### Wildcard Triggers

You can use the wildcard character in the URL Link field of a Trigger to enable the display of the Chat SDK pages that follow a URL pattern.

The asterisk (i.e., `/*` is the wildcard character you use when defining a Trigger. When you use an asterisk in the URL Link of your Trigger definition, that character will match any sequence of one or more characters.

To set a wildcard for your entire domain, enter a **URL Link** value for your domain name, followed by `/*` (e.g., `example.com/*` ). This will enable the display of the ASAPP Chat UI on all pages of your site.

To enable the ASAPP Chat UI to appear on a more limited set of pages, enter a **URL Link** value that includes the appropriate sub-route path, followed by the `/*` wildcard (e.g., `example.com/settings/*`).

This will cause the Chat UI to display on any pages that start with the URL and sub-route `example.com/settings/`, such as `example.com/settings/profile` and `example.com/settings/payment`.

#### Single-Page Triggers

If you want the ASAPP Chat UI to display on only a few specific pages, you can create a separate Trigger for each of those pages, one at a time, by entering the exact URL for the page you wish to enable in the URL Link field of the Trigger definition.

For example, entering `example.com/customer-support/shipping.html` in the URL Link field of your Trigger definition will enable the ASAPP Chat UI to display on that single page.

## Deeplinks

A feature that defines how the SDK opens hyperlinks when a user clicks a link to another document. In the ASAPP Web SDK, we use the browser's `window.location.origin` API to determine whether the link should open in the same window or a new window.

In order for a link to open in the same window as the user's current SDK window, the `window.location.origin` must return a matching protocol and hostname.

<Note>
  For example, if a user is on `https://www.example.com` and clicks a link to `https://www.example.com/page-two`, the SDK changes the current page to the destination page in the same window.
</Note>

A link opens in a *new* window if there is any difference between the current page and the destination page origin. When a user clicks a link from `https://www.example.com` to `https://subdomain.example.com` , the SDK opens the destination page in a new window due to hostname variation.

A link from `https://example.com` to `http://example.com` also opens a new window due to a mismatched protocol. When a link opens a new window, the user's SDK window remains open.


# Web JavaScript API
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api



This section details the various API methods you can call to the ASAPP Chat SDK.

Before making any API calls, make sure you've [integrated the ASAPP SDK](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start "Web Quick Start") script on your page.

Once you've integrated the SDK with your site, you can use the JavaScript API to toggle settings in the Chat SDK, trigger events, or send information to ASAPP.

The Chat SDK Web JavaScript API allows you to perform a variety of actions after the SDK has been initialized, such as the [`load`](#setCustomer) method if you are authorization a user after a conversation has started, or updating the customers info mid conversation with the [`setCustomer`](#setcustomer) method.

Read on for details on each of these methods:

* [action: `on` or `off`](#action-on-or-off)
* [`getState`](#getstate)
* [`hide`](#hide)
* [`load`](#load)
* [`refresh`](#refresh)
* [`send`](#send)
* [`set`](#set)
* [`setCustomer`](#setcustomer)
* [`setIntent`](#setintent)
* [`show`](#show)
* [`showChatInstead`](#showchatinstead)
* [`unload`](#unload)

## action: `on` or `off`

This API subscribes or unsubscribes to events that occur within the Chat SDK. A developer can apply custom behavior, track metrics, and more by subscribing to one of the Chat SDK custom events. To utilize the Action API, pass either the `on` (subscribes) or `off` (unsubscribes) keywords to the `ASAPP` method. The next argument is the name of the event binding.

The final argument is the callback handler you wish to attach. The following code snippet is an example of the Action API subscribing and unsubscribing to the `agent:assigned` and `message:received` events:

```javascript
function agentAssignedHandler (event) {
    onAgentAssigned(event.detail.issueId, event.detail.externalSenderId);
}
function messageHandler (event) {
    const { isFirstMessage, externalSenderId } = event.detail;
    if (isFirstMessage && externalSenderId) {
        OnAgentInteractive(event.detail.issueId, event.detail.customerId);
    } else if (isFirstMessage === false && isFromRep) {
        ASAPP('off', 'message:received', messageHandler);
    }
}
ASAPP('load', {
    onLoadComplete: () => {
        ASAPP('on', 'agent:assigned', agentAssignedHandler);
        ASAPP('on', 'message:received', messageHandler);
    }
});
```

### Event Object

Each event receives a `CustomEvent` object as the first argument to your event handler. This is a [standard event object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) with all typical interfaces. The object has an `event.type` with the name of the event and an `event.detail` key which contains the following custom properties:

`issueId` (Number)

The ASAPP identifier for an individual issue. This ID may change as a user completes and starts new queries to the ASAPP system.

`customerId` (Number)

The ASAPP identifier for a customer. This ID is consistent for authenticated users but may be different for anonymous ones. Anonymous users will have a consistent ID for the duration of their session.

`externalSenderId` (String)

The external identifier you provide to ASAPP that represents an agent identifier. This property will be undefined if the user is not connected with an agent.

### Chat Events

Chat events trigger when a user opens or closes the Chat SDK window. These events do not have any additional event details.

`chat:show`

* Cancellable: true

This event triggers when a user opens the Chat SDK. It may fire multiple times per session if a user repeatedly closes and opens the chat.

`chat:hide`

* Cancellable: true

This event triggers when a user closes the Chat SDK. It may fire multiple times per session if a user repeatedly opens and closes the chat.

### Issue Events

Issue events occur when a change in state of an Issue occurs within the ASAPP system. These events do not have any additional event details.

`issue:new`

* Cancellable: false

This event triggers when a user has opened a new issue. It fires when they first open the Chat SDK or if they complete an issue and start another one.

`issue:end`

* Cancellable: false

This event triggers when a user or agent has ended an issue. It fires when the user has completed an automated support request or when a user/agent ends an active chat.

### Agent Events

Agent events occur when particular actions occur with an agent within ASAPP's system. These events do not have any additional event details.

`agent:assigned`

* Cancellable: false

This event triggers when a user is connected to an agent for the first time. It fires once the user has left an automated support flow and has been connected to a live support agent.

### Message Events

Message events occur when the user receives a message from either SRS or an agent. These events have the following additional event details:

`senderType` (String)

Returns either `srs` or `agent`.

`isLiveChat` (Boolean)

Returns `true` when a user is connected with an agent. Returns `false` when a user is within an automated flow.

`isFirstMessage` (Boolean)

Returns `true` only when a message is the first message received from an agent or SRS. Otherwise returns `false`.

`message:received`

* Cancellable: false

This event triggers whenever the Chat SDK receives a message event to the chat log. It will fire when a user receives a message from SRS or an agent.

## getState

This API returns the current state of Chat SDK session. It accepts a callback which receives the current state object.

```javascript
ASAPP('getState', function(state) {
    console.log(state);
});
```

### State Object

The state object contains the following keys which give you insight into the user's actions:

`hasContext` (Object)

Returns the current [context](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider "Web ContextProvider") known by the SDK.

`hasCustomerId` (Boolean)

Returns true when the SDK has been provided with a [CustomerId](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#customerid "CustomerId") setting.

`isFullscreen` (Boolean)

Returns true when the SDK will render in fullscreen for mobile web devices.

`isLiveChat` (Boolean)

Returns true when the use is connected to an agent.

`isLoggingIn` (Boolean)

Returns true if the user has been presented with and clicked on a button to Log In.

`isMobile`(Boolean)

Returns true when the SDK is rendering on a mobile or tablet device.

`isOpen` (Boolean)

Returns true if the user has the SDK open on the current or had it open on the previous page.

`unreadMessages` (Integer)

Returns a count of how many messages the user has received since minimizing the SDK.

## hide

This API hides the Chat SDK iframe. See [Show](#-show- "'show'") for revealing the Chat SDK iframe. This method is useful for when you want to close the SDK iframe after certain page interactions or if you've provided a custom Badge entry point.

```javascript
ASAPP('hide');
```

## load

This API initializes the ASAPP Chat SDK for display on your pages and typically specify a [`contextProviderHandler`](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider).

To call the `load` the API and initialize the SDK, specify any of the [Web App Settings](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings), though the following are required:

* [APIHostname](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#apihostname): The Hostname for connection customers with customer support.
* [AppId](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#appid "AppId"): Your unique Company Identifier (or company marker).

Work with your ASAPP Account Team to determine the correct values for these settings.

Typically, you'll also specify a [`ContextProvider` handler](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider) to provide context to the SDK such as user authentication information or other customer information.

```javascript Load with CustomerInfo And Authentication Token
ASAPP('load', {
    APIHostname: '[API_HOSTNAME]',
    AppId: '[APP_ID]',
    ContextProvider: (callback) => {
        const context = {
            CustomerInfo: {
                category: 'payment',
                parent_page: 'Pay my Bill'
            },
            Auth: {
                Token: '[AUTH_TOKEN]'
            }
        };
        callback(context);
    }
});
```

Please see the [Web App Settings](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings) page for a list of all the available properties that can be passed to the `Load` API.

## refresh

This API checks to make sure that [Triggers](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-features#triggers) work properly when a page URL changes in a SPA (Single-Page Application). You should call this API every time the page URL changes if your website is a SPA.

```javascript
ASAPP('refresh')
```

## send

Use this API to update the `customerInfo` object at any time, regardless of whether the user is currently typing in the Chat SDK.

Typically, the `customerInfo` is updated as part of your [`contextProviderHandler`](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#contextprovider) function defined in your [`load`](#'load') call, which is called whenever the user types in the Chat SDK.

This API is primarily used to send information that is used to show a proactive chat prompt when a specific criteria or set of criteria are met. The `send` API is rate limited to one request for every 5 seconds.

To use this API:

* Specify a `type` of `customer`
  <Note>
    Only the `customer` event type is supported.
  </Note>
* Provide a `data` object containing the `customerInfo` object:

```javascript
ASAPP('send', {
    type: 'customer',
    data: {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    }
});
```

For example, you could use a key within `CustomerInfo` to indicate that a customer had abandoned their shopping cart. Do not use the send API for transmitting any information that you would consider sensitive or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The accepted keys are listed below.

## set

This API applies various user information to the Chat SDK. Calling this API does not make a network request. The API accepts two arguments. The first is the name of the key you want to update. The second is the value that you wish to assign the key.

```javascript
ASAPP('set', 'Auth', { Token: '3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f' });
ASAPP('set', 'ExternalSessionId', 'j6oAOxCWZh...');
```

Please see the [Context Provider](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider "Web ContextProvider") page for a list of all the properties you can provide to this API.

## setCustomer

This API provides an access token with your customers account after the Chat SDK has already loaded. This method is useful if a customer logs into their account or if you need to refresh your customers auth token from time to time. See the [SDK Settings](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings "Web App Settings") section for details on the [CustomerId](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#customerid "CustomerId") (Required), [ContextProvider](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#contextprovider "ContextProvider") (Required), and [UserLoginHandler](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#userloginhandler "UserLoginHandler") properties accepted for SetCustomers second argument.

```javascript
ASAPP('setCustomer', {
    CustomerId: 'a1b2c3x8y9z0',
    ContextProvider: function (callback) {
        var context = {
            Auth: {
                Token: '3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f'
            }
        };
        callback(context);
    }
});
```

## setIntent

This API lets you set an intent after Chat SDK has already been loaded and will take effect even if the user is in chat. ASAPP recommends that you use [Intent](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-app-settings#intent "Intent") via App Settings during load.

This method takes an object as a parameter, with a required key of `Code`. `Code` accepts a string. Your team and your ASAPP Implementation Manager will determine the available values.

```javascript
ASAPP('setIntent', {Code: 'PAYBILL'});
```

## show

This API shows the Chat SDK iframe. See [Hide](#-hide- "'hide'") for hiding the Chat SDK iframe. This method is useful for when you want to open the SDK iframe after certain page interactions or if you've provided a custom Badge entry point.

```javascript
ASAPP('show');
```

## showChatInstead

This API displays the [Chat Instead](../chat-instead/web "Web") feature.

This API displays the Chat Instead feature.

In order to enable this feature, please integrate with the `showChatInstead` API and then contact your Implementation Manager.

**Options:**

<table class="informaltable frame-void rules-rows">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="th"><p>Key</p></th>
      <th class="th"><p>Description</p></th>

<a href="tel:8001234567" onclick="ASAPP('showChatInstead', {'phoneNumber': '(800) 123-4567'})">(800) 123-4567</a>
```

## unload

This API removes all the SDK related elements from the DOM (Badge, iframe, and Proactive Messages if any). If the SDK is already open or a user is in live chat, ASAPP will ignore this call. To reload the SDK, you need to call the "Load" API.

```javascript
ASAPP('unload')
```


# Web Quick Start
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-quick-start



If you want to start fast, follow these steps:

1. Embed the Script
2. Initialize the SDK
3. Customize the SDK
4. Authenticate Users

In addition, see an example of a [Full Snippet](#full-snippet "Full Snippet").

## 1. Embed the Script

1. Embed the script directly inline. See the instructions below.
2. Use a tag manager to control where and how the scripts load. The ASAPP Chat SDK works with most tag managers. See the tag manager documentation for more detailed instructions.

To enable the ASAPP Chat SDK, you'll first need to paste the [ASAPP Chat SDK Web snippet](#full-snippet) into your site's HTML. You can place it anywhere in your markup, but it's ideal to place it near the top of the `<head>` element.

```
<script> 
(function(w,d,h,n,s){s=d.createElement('script');w[n]=w[n]||function(){(w[n]._=w[n]._||[]).push(arguments)},w[n].Host=h,s.async=1,s.src=h+'/chat-sdk.js',s.type='text/javascript',d.body.appendChild(s)}(window,document,'https://sdk.asapp.com','ASAPP')); 
</script> 
```

This snippet does two things:

1. Creates a `<script>` element that asynchronously downloads the `https://sdk.asapp.com/chat-sdk.js` JavaScript.
2. Creates a global `ASAPP` function that enables you to interact with [ASAPP's JavaScript API](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api "Web JavaScript API").

If you're curious, feel free to view the [Full Snippet](#full-snippet "Full Snippet").

## 2. Initialize the SDK

After you [Embed the Script](#1-embed-the-script "1. Embed the Script") into the page, you can start using the [JavaScript API](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api "Web JavaScript API") to initialize and display the application.

To initialize the ASAPP Chat SDK, call the `ASAPP('load')` method as seen below:

```
     <script> ASAPP('load', { 
     APIHostname: 'API_HOSTNAME', 
     AppId: 'APP_ID' 
}); 
</script> 
```

**Note:** The `APIHostname` and `AppId` values will be provided to you by ASAPP after coordination between your organization and your ASAPP Implementation Manager. Once these values have been determined and provided, you can make the following updates:

1. Replace `API_HOSTNAME` with the hostname of your ASAPP API location. This string will look something like

   ```screen
   'examplecompanyapi.asapp.com'.
   ```

2. Replace `APP_ID` with your Company Marker identifier. This string will look something like `'examplecompany'`.

Calling `ASAPP('load')` will make a network request to your APIHostname and determine whether or not it should display the Chat SDK Badge. The Badge will display based on your company's business hours, your trigger settings, and whether or not you have enabled the SDK in your Admin control panel.

For more advanced ways to display the ASAPP Chat SDK, see the [JavaScript API Documentation](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-javascript-api "Web JavaScript API").

## 3. Customize the SDK

After you  Embed the Script and Initialize the SDK, the ASAPP Chat SDK should display and function on your web page. You may wish to head to the [Customization](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-customization "Web Customization") section of the documentation to learn how to customize the appearance of the ASAPP Chat SDK.

## 4. Authenticate Users

Some integrations of the ASAPP Chat SDK allow users to access sensitive account information. If any of your use cases fall under this category, please read the [Authentication](/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-authentication "Web Authentication") section to ensure your users experience a secure and seamless session.

## Full Snippet

For additional legibility, here's the full Chat SDK Web integration snippet:

```json
(function(win, doc, hostname, namespace, script) {
    script = doc.createElement('script');
    win[namespace] = win[namespace] || function() {
        (win[namespace]._ = win[namespace]._ || []).push(arguments)
    }
    win[namespace].Host = hostname;
    script.async = 1;
    script.src = hostname + '/chat-sdk.js';
    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    doc.body.appendChild(script);
})(window, document, 'https://sdk.asapp.com', 'ASAPP');
```


# WhatsApp Business
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/integrations/whatsapp-business



WhatsApp Business is a service that enables your organization to communicate directly with your customers in WhatsApp through your Customer Service Platform (CSP), which in this case will be ASAPP.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-a8fc6036-09ca-5466-d058-e0276eec7922.png" />
</Frame>

## Quick Start Guide

1. Create a Business Manager (BM) Account with Meta
2. Create WhatsApp Business Accounts (WABA) in AI-Console
3. Modify Flows and Test
4. Create and Implement Entry Points
5. Determine Launch and Throttling Strategy

### Create a Business Manager (BM) Account

Before integrating with ASAPP's WhatsApp adapter, you must create a Business Manager (BM) account with Meta - visit [this page for account creation](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347).

Following account creation, Meta will also request you follow a [business verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1095661473946872?id=180505742745347) process before proceeding.

### Create WhatsApp Business Accounts (WABAs)

Once a Business Manager account is created and verified, proceed to set up WhatsApp Business Accounts (WABAs) using Meta's embedded signup flow in AI-Console's **Messaging Channels** section.

<Note>
  Five total WABAs need to be created: three for lower environments, one for the demo (testing) environment and one for production. Your ASAPP account team can assist with creation of WABAs for lower environments if needed - please reach out with your teams to coordinate account creation.
</Note>

In this signup flow, you will set up an account name, time zone and payment method for the WABA and assign full control permissions to the `ASAPP (System User)`.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-3a15bf96-9209-4bd7-25cc-67e5ee695259.png" />
</Frame>

#### Register Phone Numbers

As part of the signup flow, each WABA must have at least one phone number assigned to it (multiple phone #s per WABA are supported). Before adding a number, you must also create a profile display name, **which must match the name of the Business Manager (BM) account.**

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-3d34fe68-0d11-0120-d9b2-4a95c1a9ad46.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  For implementation speed, ASAPP recommends using ASAPP-provisioned phone numbers for the three lower environment WABAs. Your ASAPP account team can guide you through this process.
  All provisioned phone numbers registered to WABAs need to meet [requirements specified by Meta](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/phone-numbers#pick-number).
</Note>

### Modify Flows and Test

The WhatsApp customer experience is distinct from ASAPP SDKs in several ways - some elements of the Virtual Agent are displayed differently while others are not supported. Your ASAPP account team will work with you to implement intent routing and flows to account for nodes with unsupported elements and to validate expected behaviors during testing before launch.

#### Buttons and Forms

All buttons with external links are displayed using message text with a link for each button. See below for an example of two buttons (**Hello, I open a link** and **Hello, I open a view**) that each render as a message with a link:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-738af325-85a2-2ecd-3052-7770b9b5ab32.png" />
</Frame>

Similarly, forms sent by agents and feedback forms at the end of chat also send messages with links to a separate page to complete the survey. Once the survey is completed, users are redirected back to WhatsApp.

#### Quick Reply Limitations

Quick replies in WhatsApp also have different limitations from other ASAPP SDKs:

* Each node may only include up to three quick reply options; a node with more than three replies will be truncated and only the first three replies will be shown.
* Each quick reply may only include up to 20 characters; a quick reply with more than 20 characters will be truncated and only show the first 17 characters, followed by an ellipsis
* Sending a node that includes both a button in the message and quick replies is not recommended, as the links will be sent to the customer out of order

#### Authentication

The WhatsApp Cloud API currently **does not support authentication**. As such, login nodes should not be used in flows that can be reached by users on WhatsApp.

#### Attachments Cards

Nodes that include attachments, such as cards and carousels, are not supported in this channel.

<Note>
  In addition to differences in the Virtual Agent experience, the live chat experience with an agent also excludes some features that are typically supported:

  * **Images**: Agents will not be able to view images sent by customers. The same is true of voice messages and emojis, which are also part of the WhatsApp interface.
  * **Typing preview and indicators**: Agents will not see typing previews or indicators while the customer is typing. The customer will not see a typing indicator while the agent is typing.
  * **Co-browsing**: This capability is not currently supported in WhatsApp
</Note>

### Create and Implement Entry Points

Entry points are where your customers start conversations with your business. You have the option to embed a WhatsApp entry point into your websites in multiple ways: a clickable logo, text link, on-screen QR code, etc.

You can also direct to WhatsApp from social media pages or using Meta's Ads platform to provide an entry point. Ads are fully configurable within the Meta suite of products and will result in no costs incurred for conversations that originate via interactions with them.

<Note>
  ASAPP does not currently support [Chat Instead](/messaging-platform/integrations/chat-instead "Chat Instead") functionality for WhatsApp.
</Note>

### Determine Launch and Throttling Strategy

Depending on the entry points configured, your ASAPP account team will share launch best practices and throttling strategies.


# Virtual Agent
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/virtual-agent

Learn how to use Virtual Agent to automate your customer interactions.

Virtual Agent is a set of automation tooling that enables you to automate your customer interactions and route them to the right agents when needed.

Virtual Agent provides a means for better understanding customer issues, offering self-service options, and connecting with live agents when necessary.

Virtual Agent can be deployed to your website or mobile app via our Chat SDKs, or directly to channels like Apple Messages for Businesses.

While you'll start off with a baseline set of [core dialog capabilities](#core-dialog "Core Dialog"), the Virtual Agent will require thoughtful configuration to appropriately handle the use cases specific to your business.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-6fff0b03-48d7-8386-cb55-98c5317f9d2e.gif" />
</Frame>

## Customization

Virtual Agent is fully customizable to fit your brand's unique needs. This includes:

* Determining the list of Intents and how they are routed.
* Advanced flows to take in structured and unstructured input.
* Reach out to APIs to both receive and send data.

### Access

The Virtual Agent is configured through the AI-Console. To access AI-Console, log into [Insights Manager](/messaging-platform/insights-manager "Insights Manager"), click on your user icon, and then **Go to AI-Console**. This option will only be available if your organization has granted you permission to access AI-Console.

## How It Works

The Virtual Agent understands what customers say and transforms it into structured data that you can use to define how the Virtual Agent responds. This is accomplished via the following core concepts and components:

### Intents

Intents are the set of reasons that a customer might contact your business and are recognized by the Virtual Agent when the customer first reaches out.

The Virtual Agent can also understand when a user changes intent in the middle of a conversation (see: [digressions](#core-dialog "Core Dialog")).

Our teams can work with you to refine your intent list on an ongoing basis, and train the Virtual Agent to recognize them. Examples include requests to "Pay Bill" or "Reset Password".

Once an intent is recognized, it can be used to determine what happens next in the dialog.

### Intent Routes

Once an intent has been recognized, the next question is "so what?". Intent routes house the logic that determines what will happen after an intent has been recognized.

* Once a customer's intent is classified, the default behavior is for the Virtual Agent to place the customer in an agent queue
* Alternatively, an intent route can be used to specify a pre-defined flow for the Virtual Agent to execute, which can be used to collect additional information, offer solutions, or link a customer out to self-serve elsewhere.
* To promote flexibility, intent routes can point to different flows based on conditional logic that uses contextual data, like customer channels.

### Flows

Flows define how the Virtual Agent interacts with the customer given a specific situation. They can be as simple as an answer to an FAQ, or as complex as a multi-turn dialog used to offer self-service recommendations. Flows are built through a series of [nodes](#flow-nodes "Flow Nodes") that dictate the flow of the conversation as well as any business logic it needs to perform. Once built, flows can be reached through [intent routing](#intent-routes "Intent Routes"), or redirected to from other flows.

<Card title="Flows" href="/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/flows">For more information on how flows are built, see our Flow Building Guide</Card>

### Core Dialog

While much of what the Virtual Agent does is customized in flows, some fundamental aspects are driven by the Virtual Agent's core dialog system. This system defines the behavior for:

* **Welcome experience**:
  The messages that are sent when a chat window is opened, or a first message is received.
* **Disambiguation**:
  How the Virtual Agent clarifies ambiguous or vague initial utterances.
* **Digressions**:
  How the Virtual Agent handles a new path of dialog when customer expresses a new intent.
* **Enqueuement & waiting**:
  How the Virtual Agent transitions customers to live chat, including enqueuement, wait time, & business hours messaging.
* **Post-live-chat experience**:
  What the Virtual Agent does when a customer concludes an interaction with a Live agent.
* **Error handling**:
  How the Virtual Agent handles API errors or unrecognized customer responses.

If you have any questions about these settings, please contact your ASAPP Team.

## Flow Nodes

Flows are built through a series of nodes that dictate the flow of the conversation as well as any business logic it needs to perform.

1. **Response Node**:
   The most basic function of a flow is to define how the Virtual Agent should converse with the customer.
   This is accomplished through response nodes which allow you to configure Virtual Agent responses, send deeplinks, and classify what customers say in return.
2. **Login Node**
   When building a flow, you may want to force users to login before proceeding to later nodes in a flow.
   This is accomplished by adding a login node to your flow that directs the customer to authenticate in order to proceed.
3. **API Node**
   If API integrations are available within the virtual agent, you are able to leverage those integrations to display data dynamically to customers and to route to different responses based on what is returned from an API.
   API nodes allow for the retrieval of data fields and the usage of that data within a flow.
4. **Redirect Node**
   Flows also have the ability to link to one another through the use of redirect notes.
   This is powerful in situations where the same series of dialog turns appear in multiple flows. Flow redirects allow you to manage those dialog turns in a single location that is referenced by many flows.
5. **Agent Node**
   In cases where the flow is unable to address the customer's concern on its own, an agent node is used to direct the customer to an agent queue.
   The data associated with this customer will be used to determine the live agent queue to put them in.
6. **End Node**
   When your flow has reached its conclusion, an end node wraps up the conversation by confirming whether the customer needs additional help.


# Attributes
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/attributes



ASAPP supports attributes that can be routed on to funnel customers to the right flow through [intent routing](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing "Intent Routing").

Attributes tell the virtual agent who the customer is. For example, they indicate if a customer is currently authenticated, which channel the customer is using to communicate with your business, or which services and products the customer is engaged with.

</Frame>

## Attributes List

The Attributes List contains all the attributes available for intent routing. Here, you'll find the following information displayed in table format:

1. **Attribute name:** display name of the attribute
2. **Definition:** Indicates if the attribute is Standard or Custom. Standard attributes are natively supported by ASAPP. Custom attributes are added in accordance with your business requirements\*
3. **Type:** Indicates the value type of an attribute. There are two possible types: Boolean, or Value.
   a.  **Boolean:** A boolean attribute includes two values. For example: Yes/No, True/False, On/Off.
   b.  **Value:** A value attribute can include any number of values. For example: Market 1, Market 2, Market 3.
4. **Origin Key:** exact value that is passed from the company to ASAPP.

# Best Practices
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/best-practices



## Designing your Virtual Agent

### 1. Focus on Customer Problems

The most important thing to keep in mind when designing a good flow is whether it is likely to resolve the intent for most of your customers. It can be easy to diverge from this strategy (perhaps because a flow is designed with containment top of mind; perhaps because of inherent business process limitations). But it's the best way you can truly allow customers to self-serve.

### (a) Understanding the Intent

Since flows are invoked when ASAPP classifies an intent, understanding the intent in question is key to successfully designing a flow. The best way to do this is to review recent utterances that have been classified to the intent and categorizing them into more nuanced use cases that your flow must address. This will ensure that the flow you design is complete in its coverage given how customers will enter the flow.

These utterances are accessible through ASAPP Historical Reporting, in the First Utterance table.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-a89adeb3-7316-62c2-c885-910d111a7d8a.png" />
</Frame>

### (b) Ongoing Refinement

Every flow you build can be thought of as a hypothesis for how to effectively understand and respond to your customers in a given scenario. Your ability to refine those hypotheses over time--and test new ones--is key to managing a truly effective virtual agent program that meets your customers needs.

We recommend performing the following steps on a regular basis--at least monthly--to identify opportunities for flow refinement, and improve effectiveness over time.

#### Step 1: Identify opportunity areas in particular flows

1. **Flows with relatively high containment, but a low success rate:** This indicates that customers are dropping out of the flow before they receive useful information.
2. **Flows with the highest negative EndSRS rates:** This indicates that the flow did not meet the customer's needs.

#### Step 2: Determine Likely Causes for Flow Underperformance, Identify Remedies

Once you've identified problematic flows, the next step is to determine why they are under-performing. In most cases you'll quickly identify at least one of the following issues with your flow by reviewing transcripts of issueIDs from Conversation Manager in Insights Manager:

**1. General unhelpfulness or imprecise responses**

Oftentimes flows break down when the virtual agent responds confidently in a manner that is on-topic but completely misses the customers' point. A common example is customers reaching out about a difficulty to log in, only to be sent to the same "forgot your password" experience they were experiencing issues with in the first place. Issues of this type typically receive a negative EndSRS score from the customer, who doesn't believe their problem has been solved.

The key to increase the performance of these flows is to configure the virtual agent to ask further, more specific questions before jumping to conclusions. Following the example above, you could ask "Have you tried resetting your password yet?". Including this question can go a long way to ensure that the customer receives the support they're looking for.

**2. Unrecognized customer responses**

This happens when the customer says or wants to say something that the virtual agent is unable to understand.

In free-text channels, this will result in classification errors where the virtual agent has re-prompted the customer to no avail, or has incorrectly attempted to digress to another intent. You can identify these issues by searching for re-prompt language in transcripts where customers have escalated to an agent from the flow in question. Looking at the customers' problematic response, you can determine how best to improve your flow. If customers' response is reasonable given the prompt, you can introduce a new response route in the flow and train it to understand what the customer is saying. Even if it's a path of dialog you don't want the virtual agent to pursue, it's better for the virtual agent to acknowledge what they said and redirect rather than failing to understand entirely.

**Don't:**

* "Which option would you prefer?"
* "Let's do both"
* "Sorry I didn't understand that. Could you try again?"

**Do:**

* "Which option would you prefer?"
* "Let's do both"
* "Sorry, but we can only accommodate one. Do you have a preference?"

Another option for avoiding unrecognized customer responses in free-text channels, is to rephrase the prompt in a manner that reduces the number of ways that a customer is likely to respond. This is often the best approach in cases where the virtual agent prompt is vague or open-ended.

**Don't:**

* "What issue are you having with your internet?"
* "I think maybe my router is broken"
* "Sorry I didn't understand that. Could you try again?"

**Do:**

* "Is your internet slow, or is it completely down?"
* "It's completely down"

In SDK channels (web or mobile apps), which are driven by quick replies, the concern here is to ensure that customers have the opportunity to respond in the way that makes sense given their situation. A common example failing to provide an "I'm not sure" quick reply option when asking a "yes or no" question. Faced with this situation, customers will often click on "new question" or abandon the chat entirely, leaving very little signal on what they intended. The best way to improve quick reply coverage is to maintain a clear understanding of the different contexts in which a customer might enter the flow---how they conceive of their issue, what information they might or might not have going in, etc. Gaining this perspective is helped greatly by reviewing live chat interactions that relate to the flow in question, and determining whether your flow could have accommodated the customer's situation.

**3. Incorrect classification**

This issue is unique to free-text use cases and happens when the virtual agent thinks the customer said one thing, when in fact the customer meant something else. One example would be a response like "no idea" being misclassified as "no" rather than the expected "I'm not sure."

Another example might be a response triggering a digression (i.e., a change of intent in the middle of a conversation), rather than an expected trained response route. This can happen in flows where you've trained response routes to help clarify a customer's issue but their response sounds like an intent and thus triggers a digression instead of the response route you intended. For example:

```
"I need help with a refund"
"No problem. What is the reason for the refund?"
"My flight got cancelled"
"Are you trying to rebook travel due to a cancelled flight?"\<\< Digression
"No, I'm asking about a refund"
```

While these issues tend to occur infrequently, when you do encounter them, the best place to start is revising the prompt to encourage responses that are less likely to be classified incorrectly. For example, instead of asking an open-ended question like "What is the reason for your refund?"---to which a customer response is very likely to sound like an intent---you can ask directly ("Was your flight cancelled?") or ask for more concrete information from which you can infer the answer ("No problem! What's the confirmation number?").

Alternatively, you can solve issues of incorrect classification by training a specific response route that targets the exact language that is proving problematic. In the case of the unclear "I'm not sure" route, a response route that's trained explicitly to recognize "no idea" might perform better than one that is broadly trained to recognize the long tail of phrases that more or less mean "I'm not sure." In this case, you can point the response route to the same node as your generic "I'm not sure" route to resolve the issue.

**4. Too much friction**

Another cause for underperformance is too much friction in a particular flow. This happens when the virtual agent is asking a lot of the customer.

One type of friction is authentication. Customers don't always remember their specific login or PINs, so authentication requests should be used only when needed. If customers are asked to find their authentication information unnecessarily, many will oftentimes abandon the chat.

Another type of friction is repetitive or redundant steps--particularly around disambiguating the customer. While it's helpful to clarify what a customer wants to do to adequately solve their need, repetitive questions that don't feel like they are progressing the customer forward often lead to a feeling of frustration--and abandonment.

#### Step 3: Version, improve, and track the impact of flow changes

Once you've identified an issue with a specific flow, create a new version of it in AI-Console with one of the remedies outlined above. After you have implemented a new version, you can save and release the new version to a lower environment to test it, and subsequently to production. Then, track the impact in Historical Reporting in Insights Manager by looking at the Flow Success Rate for such flow on the Business Flow Details tab of the Flow Dashboard.

### 2. Know your Channels

Messaging channels have advantages and limitations. Appreciating the differences will help you optimize virtual agents for the channels they live on, and avoid channel-specific pitfalls.

To illustrate this, look at a single flow rendered in Apple Messages for Business vs the ASAPP SDK:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-1292d466-63c5-f625-2003-effbc90135a4.jpg" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  The ASAPP SDK has quick replies, while Apple Messages for Business supports list pickers.
</Note>

#### (a) General rules of thumb

* Be aware of each channel's strengths and limitations and optimize accordingly--these are described below.
* Pay particular attention to potentially confusing interface states, and compensate by being explicit about how you expect customers to interact with a flow (e.g., "Choose an option below ...")
* Be sure to test the flow on the device/channel it is deployed to in a lower environment.

#### (b) Channel-specific considerations

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-c2c43557-dc9f-4bed-0af4-634b9d0a2a63.png" />
</Frame>

##### ASAPP SDK

The ASAPP SDKs (Web, Android, and iOS) have a number of features that help to build rich virtual agent experiences.

Strengths of SDKs:

1. Quick Replies - surface explicit text options to a customer to tap/click on, and route to the next part of a flow.
2. Authentication / context - with the authentication of customers, the SDK allows for a persistent chat history which provides seamless continuity. Additionally, authentication allows for the direct calling of APIs (e.g. retrieving a bill amount).

Limitations:

* Not as sticky of an experience (i.e. it's not an application the customer has top of mind/high visibility), so the customer may abandon the chat. One cause for this is the lack of guaranteed push notifications -- particularly in the Web SDK.

How to optimize for ASAPP SDKs:

* We encourage you to build more complicated, multi-step flows, leveraging quick replies that keep customers on the rails.

### 3. Promote Function over Form

First and foremost, your virtual agent needs to be effective at facilitating dialog. It may be tempting to prioritize focus on virtual agent tone and voice but that can ultimately detract from virtual agent's functional purpose. Next we'll offer examples that illustrate effective or ineffective dialogs that will help you when building out your flows.

#### (a) It's OK to sound Bot-like

The virtual agent **is** a bot, and it primarily serves a functional purpose. It is much better to be explicit with customers and move the conversation forward, rather than making potential UX sacrifices to sound friendly or human-like. Customers are coming to a virtual agent to solve a specific problem efficiently. Here is a positive example of a greeting that, while bot-like, is clear and effective:

```
"Hello! How can I help you today? Choose from a topic below or type a specific question."
```

#### (b) Tell People How to Interact

Customers interact with virtual agents to solve a problem and/or to achieve something. They benefit from explicit guidance with how they are supposed to interact with the virtual agent. If your flow design expects the customer to do something, tell them upfront. Here is a positive example of clear instructions telling a customer how to interact with the virtual agent:

```
"Please choose an option below so we can best help"
```

#### (c) Set Clear Expectations for Redirects

The virtual agent can't always handle a customer's issue. When you need to redirect the customer to self-serve on a website, or even on a phone number, set clear expectations for what they need to do next. You never want a customer to feel abandoned. Here are two positive examples of very clear instructions about what the customer will need to do next, and what they can expect:

```
"To process your payment and complete your request, you'll need to call us at 1-800-555-5555. **Agents are available** from 8am to 9pm ET, Monday through Friday"
"You can check the status of your order on website by either **entering your order number** or **logging in**".
```

#### (d) Acknowledge Progress & Justify Steps

Think of a bot like a standard interaction funnel -- a customer has to go through multiple steps to achieve an outcome. Acknowledging progress made and justifying steps to the customer makes for a better user experience, and makes it more like for the customer to complete all of the steps (think of a breadcrumb in a checkout flow). The customer should have a sense of where they are in the process. Here's a simple example of orienting a customer to where they are in a process:

```
"We're happy to help answer questions about your bill, but will need you to sign in so we can access your account information."
```

#### (e) Be careful with Personification

Over-personifying your virtual agent can make for a frustrating customer experience:

* **Do** frame language in a more impersonal "we"
* **Don't** make the virtual agent "I"
* **Do** frame the virtual agent as a representative for your company.
* **Don't** give your virtual agent a name / distinct personality.
* **Do** give your virtual agent a warm, action-oriented tone.
* **Don't** give your virtual agent an overly friendly, text-heavy tone.
* **Do** "Great! We can help you pay your bill now. What payment method would you like to use?"
* **Don't** "Great, thank you so much for clarifying that! I am so happy to help you with your bill today."

#### (f) Affirm What Customers Say, Not What the Flow Does

Affirmations help customers feel heard, and they help customers understand what the virtual agent is taking away from their responses. When drafting a virtual agent response, ensure that you match the copy to the variety of customer responses that may precede it -- historical customer responses can be viewed in the utterance table in historical reporting.

If there is a broad set reasons for a customer to end up on a node or a flow, your affirmation should likewise be broad:

* **Do** "We can help with that"
* **Do** "We can help you with your bill"
* **Don't** "We can help you pay your bill online"

Similarly, if there is a narrow set of reasons for a customer to end up in a node or a flow, your affirmation should likewise be narrow. Even then, it's important to not phrase things in such a way that you're putting words in the mouth of the customer, so they don't feel frustrated by the virtual agent.

* **Do** "To set up autopay ..."
* **Don't** "It sounds like you want to set up autopay"
* **Don't** "Okay, so autopay"

In some cases where writing a good affirmation feels particularly tricky, feel free to err on the side of not having one. It's all good so long as the virtual agent responds in an expected manner given what the customer just said.

### 4. Reduce Friction

If interacting with your virtual agent is confusing or hard, people will revert to tried and true escalation pathways like shouting "agent" or just calling in. As you are designing flows, be mindful about the following friction points you could potentially introduce in your flows.

#### (a) Be Judicious with Deep Links

Deep links are used when you link a customer out of chat to self-serve. It is tempting to leverage existing web pages, and to create dozens of flows that are simple link outs. But this often does not provide a good customer experience.

A virtual agent that is mostly single step deep links will feel like a frustrating search engine. Wherever possible, try to solve a customer's problem conversationally within the chat itself. Don't rely on links as a default.

But, when you **do** rely on a deep link, make sure to:

1. Validate the link actually solves the customers intent and is accessible to all customers (e.g. not behind an authentication wall, or only accessible to certain types of customers).
2. Leverage native app links where possible.
3. Be clear about what the customer needs to do when they go to the link and leave the chat experience.

#### (b) Avoid All-or-Nothing Flow Requirements

Be careful with "all or nothing" requirements in a flow; if you want a customer to sign in to allow you to access an API, that's great, but give customers an alternative option at that moment too. Some customers might not remember their password.

When you are at a point in a flow where there is a required step or just one direction a customer can go, think about what alternative answer there could be for a customer. If you don't, those customers might just abandon the virtual agent at that point.

</Frame>

### 5. Anticipate Failure

It's tempting to design with the happy path in mind, but customers don't always go down the flow you expect. Anticipate the failure points in a virtual agent, and design for them explicitly.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-becca11d-1103-3bc9-0136-314e9c37e768.png" />
</Frame>

#### (a) Explicit Design for Error Cases

Always imagine something will go wrong when asking the customer to do something:

* When asking customer to complete something manually, give them a response route or a quick reply that allows them to acknowledge it's not working (e.g. the speed test isn't working).
* When asking the customer to self-serve on a web page or in chat: allow them to go down a path in case that doesn't work (e.g. login isn't working).
* When designing flows that involve self-service through APIs: explicitly design for what happens when the API doesn't work.

#### (b) Consider Free Text Errors

In channels where free text is always enabled (i.e.. AMB, SMS), the customer input may not be recognized. We recommend writing language that guides the customer to explicitly understand the types of answers we're expecting. Leverage "else" conditions in your flows (on Response Nodes).

**Don't:**

* "What issue are you having with your internet?"
* "I think maybe my router is broken"
* "Sorry I didn't understand that. Could you try again?"
  **Do:**
* "Is your internet slow, or is it completely down?"
* "I think maybe my router is broken"
* "Sorry I didn't understand that. Is your internet slower than usual, or is your internet completely off?"

## Measuring Virtual Agents

### 1. Flow Success

Containment is a measure of whether a customer was prevented from escalating to an agent; it is the predominant measure in the industry for chatbot effectiveness. ASAPP, however, layers a more stringent definition called "Flow success," which indicates whether or not a customer was actually helped by the virtual agent.

### Important

When you are designing a new flow or modifying an existing flow, be sure to enable flow success when you have provided useful information to the customer.

"Flow success" is defined as when a customer arrives at a screen or receives a response that:

1. Provides useful information addressing the recognized intent of the inquiry.
2. Confirms a completed transaction in a back-end system.
3. Acknowledges the customer has resolved an issue successfully.

With flow success, chronology matters. If a customer starts a flow, and is presented with insightful information (i.e. success), but then escalates to an agent in the middle of a flow (i.e. negation of success), that issue will be recorded as not successful.

### How It Works

Flow success is an event that can be emitted on a [node](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/flows#node-types "Node Types").

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-13212102-24e9-2e15-aef8-86c92ff5f2a5.jpg" />
</Frame>

It is incumbent on the author of a flow to define which steps in the flow they design could be considered successful.

Default settings:

* **Response Nodes:** When flow reporting status is **on**, the **success** option will be chosen by default.
* **Agent Node:** When flow reporting status is **on**, the **failure** option will be chosen.
* **End & Redirect:** Flow success is not available in the tooling. By default, the End Node question will emit or not emit flow success depending on the customer response.

### 2. Assessing a Flow's Performance

You're able to track your flows' performance on the "Automation Success" report in historical reporting. There you can assess containment metrics and flow success which will help you determine whether a flow is performing according to expectations.

## Tactical Flow Creation Guide

### 1. Naming Nodes

Flows are composed of different node types, which represent a particular state/act of a given flow. When you create a flow, you create a number of different nodes.

We recommend naming nodes to describe what the node accomplishes in a flow. Clear node names will make the data more readable going forward. Here are some best practices to keep in mind:

* Response node (no prompt): name is by the content (e.g. "NoBalanceMessage")
* Response node (with prompt): name by the request (e.g. "RequestSeatPreferences")
* Any node that takes an action of some sort should start with the action being taken and end with what is being acted upon (e.g. "ResetModem")

### 2. Training Response Routes

When you create a Response Node that is expected to classify free text customer input (e.g. "Would you like a one way flight or a round trip flight?"), you need to supply training utterances to train a response route. There are some best practices you should keep in mind:

* Be explicit where possible.
* Vary your language.
* More training utterances is almost always better.
* Keep neighboring routes in mind -- what are the different types of answers you will be training, and how will the responses differ between them?

### 3. Designing Disambiguation

Sometimes customers initiate conversations with vague utterances like "Help with bill" or "Account issues." In these cases the virtual agent understands enough to classify the customer's intent, but not enough to immediately solve their problem.

In these cases, you are able to design a flow that asks follow-up questions to disambiguate the customer's particular need. Based on the customer's response you can redirect them to more granular intents where they can better be helped.

Designing effective disambiguation starts with reviewing historical conversations to get a sense of what types of issues customer's are having related to the vague intent. Once you've determined these, you'll want to optimize your prompt and response routes for the channel your designing for:

#### (a) ASAPP SDKs

These channels are driven by quick replies only, meaning that the customer can only choose an option that is provided by the virtual agent. Here, the prompt matters less than the response branches / quick replies you write. Just make sure they map to things a customer would say---even if multiple response routes lead to the same place. For example:

```
We're happy to help! Please choose an option below:
-   Billing history
-   Billing complaint
-   Billing question
-   Something else
```

#### (b) Free-Text Channels, with Optional Quick Replies (Post-iOS 15 AMB)

These channels offer quick replies, but do not prevent customers from responding with free text. The key here is optimizing your question to increase the likelihood that customers choose a quick reply.

```
We're happy to help! Please tap on one of the options below:
-   Billing history
-   Billing complaint
-   Billing question
-   Something else
```

#### (c) Free-Text-Only Channels (Pre iOS 15 AMB, SMS )

These channels are often the most challenging, as the customer could respond in any number of ways, and given the minimal context of the conversation it's challenging to train the virtual agent to adequately understand all of them. Similar to other channels, the objective is to prompt in a manner that limits how customers are likely to respond. The simplest approach here is to list out options as part of your prompt:

```
Please tell us more about your billing needs. You can say things like "Billing history" "Question" "Complaint" or "Something else"
```

### 4. Message Length

Keep messages to be short and to the point. Walls of text can be intimidating. Never allow an individual message to exceed 400 characters (or, even less if there are spaces)..

An example of something to avoid:

</Frame>

### 5. Quick Replies

Quick Replies should be short and to the point. Some things to keep in mind when writing Quick Replies:

* Avoid punctuation
* Use sentence case capitalization, unless you're referring to a specific product or feature.
* Keep to at least two and up to five quick replies per node.
  * While this is generally best practice, it is required for Quick Replies in Apple Messages for Business.
  * If there are more than 3 Quick Replies, the list will be truncated to the first 3 in WhatsApp Business
* External channels have character limits and any Quick Replies longer than these limits will be truncated:
  * Apple Messages for Business: 24 characters maximum
  * WhatsApp Business: 20 characters maximum


# Flows
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/flows

Learn how to build flows to define how the virtual agent interacts with the customer.

Flows define how the virtual agent interacts with the customer. They can be as simple as an answer to an FAQ, or as complex as a multi-turn dialog used to offer self-service recommendations.

Flows are built through a series of [nodes](getting-started#flow-nodes "Flow Nodes") that dictate the flow of the conversation as well as any business logic it needs to perform. Once built, flows can be reached from intents, or redirected to from other flows.

## Flows List

In the flows page, you will find a list of existing flows for your business. The following information displays in table format:

* **Flow Name**
  A unique flow name, with letters and numbers only.
* **Flow Description**
  A brief description that describes the objective of the flow.
* **Traffic from Intent**
  Intents can be routed to specific flows through [intent routing](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing "Intent Routing"). In this column, you will see which intents route to the respective flow.
  You can click the intent to navigate to the specific [intent routing detail page](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing#intent-routing-detail-page "Intent Routing Detail Page") to view routing behavior details.
* **Traffic from Redirect**
  Flows have the ability to link to one another through the use of [redirect nodes](#redirect-node "Redirect Node"). In this column, you will be able to see which existing flows redirect to the respective flow. You can click the flow to navigate to the specific [flow builder page](#flow-builder "Flow Builder") to view flow details.

## Flow Builder

The flow builder consists of three major parts:

1. Flow Graph
2. Node Configuration Panel
3. Toolbar

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-2e31ab13-f4ee-ceee-c22a-f245d0af9f7c.jpg" />
</Frame>

### Flow Graph

The Flow Graph is a visual representation of the conversation flow you're designing, and displays all possible paths of dialog as you create them.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-61217916-747e-69d4-fc86-34b2e2708503.jpg" />
</Frame>

#### Select Nodes

Each node in the graph can be selected by clicking anywhere on the node. Upon selection, the node configuration panel will automatically expand on the right.

#### Flow Graph Zoom

You can zoom in on particular parts of the flow by using the zoom percentage bar at the bottom right or using your computer trackpad or mouse.

### Node Configuration Panel

The node configuration panel allows you to manage settings and configure routing rules for the following [node types](#node-types "Node Types"):

* [Response Node](#node-types "Node Types"): configure virtual agent responses, send deeplinks, and classify what customers say in return.
* [Login Node](#login-node "Login Node"): direct the customer to authenticate before proceeding in the flow.
* [Redirect Node](#redirect-node "Redirect Node"): redirect customer to another flow.
* [Agent Node](#agent-node "Agent Node"): direct the customer to an agent queue.
* [End Node](#end-node "End Node"): wrap up the conversation by confirming whether the customer needs additional help.
* [API Node](#api-node): use API fields dynamically in your flows.

### Toolbar

The toolbar displays the flow name and allows to you perform a number of different functions:

1. [Version Dropdown:](#navigate-flow-versions "Navigate Flow Versions") view and toggle through multiple versions of the flow.
2. [Version Indicators](#version-indicators "Version Indicators"): keep track of flow version deployment to Test or Production environments
3. [Manage Versions](#manage-versions "Manage Versions"): manage flow version deployment to Test or Production environments
4. [Preview](#preview-flow "Preview Flow"): click to preview your current flow version in real-time
5. More Actions:
   * Copy link to test: Navigate to your demo environment to test a flow.
   * Flow Settings: View flow information such as name, description, and flow shortcut.

</Frame>

## Node Types

### Response Node

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/NodeResponse.png" />
</Frame>

The **Response** node allows you to configure virtual agent responses, send deeplinks, and classify what customers say in return. It consists of three sections:

1. **Content**
2. **Routing**
3. **Advanced Settings**

### Content

The **Content** section allows you to specify the responses and deeplinks that will be sent to the customer. You can add as many of either as you like by clicking **Add Content** and selecting from the menu.

Once added, this content can be easily reordered by dragging, or deleted by hovering over the content block and clicking the trash icon. In the flow graph, you will be able to preview how the content will be displayed to the customer.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-14590ffb-dd26-1a48-5ebe-05db63fb8363.jpg" />
</Frame>

#### Responses

Any response text you specify will be sent to the customer when they reach the node.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-84c5c765-de30-25c9-c32b-5de3ab523672.jpg" />
</Frame>

#### Deeplinks

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-38b352a6-f2d5-0ae0-d93d-c5ae1d9e923d.jpg" />
</Frame>

After selecting **Deeplink** from the **Add Content** menu, the following additional fields will appear:

* **Link to**: select an existing link from the dropdown or directly [create a new link](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/links#create-a-link "Create a Link").
  If you select an existing link, you can click **View link definition** to open the specific [link details](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/links#edit-a-link "Edit a Link") in a new tab.
* **Call to action**: define the accompanying text that the customer will click on in order to navigate to the link.
* **Hide button after new message**: choose to remove the deeplink after a new response appears to prevent users from navigating to the link past this node.

### Routing

The **Routing** section is where you will configure what happens after the content is sent.

You have two options:

* **Jump to node**
  Choosing to **Jump to node** allows you to define a default routing rule that will execute immediately after the node content has been delivered to the user.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-f74dc1d8-2dee-eee0-bea5-c75cd13dcb06.jpg" />
</Frame>

* **Wait for response**

  Choosing to **Wait for response** means that the virtual agent will pause until the customer responds, then attempt to classify their response and branch accordingly. When this option is selected, you'll need to specify the branches and [quick reply text](#quick-replies "Quick Replies") for each type of response you wish the virtual agent to classify. See [Branch Classifiers](#branch-classifiers "Branch Classifiers") section for more detailed information.

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-de9b034a-8962-3900-0949-21b147a981f7.jpg" />
  </Frame>

Flows cannot end on a response node. To appropriately end a flow after a response node, please route to an [End node](#end-node "End Node").

#### Branch Classifiers

When **Wait for response** is selected for routing, you can define the branches for each type of response you wish the virtual agent to classify.

There are two types of branch classifiers that you can use:

* **System classifiers**
  ASAPP supports pre-trained system templates to classify free text user input. You can use branches like `CONFIRM` or `DENY` that are already trained by our system and are readily available for use for polar (yes/no) questions. You do not need to supply training utterances for system classifiers.

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-c020323d-4882-3db7-a342-d892c0cdbf46.png" />
  </Frame>

* **Custom classifiers**
  If pre-trained classifiers do not meet your needs, define your own custom branches and supply training utterances. You must give your branch classifier a **Display Name** and supply at least five training utterances to train this custom classification. Learn more about how to best train your custom branches in the [Training response route](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/best-practices#2-training-response-routes "2. Training Response Routes") section.

</Frame>

#### Quick Replies

For each branch classifier, you should define the corresponding **Quick Reply text**. These will appear in our SDKs (web, mobile) and third-party channels as tapable options.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-f4cd3e23-d37a-355f-7005-60d313f6f8ac.png" />
</Frame>

### Advanced Settings

In the **Advanced Settings** section, you can set flow success reporting for the response node.

#### Flow Success

Flow success attempts to accurately measure whether a customer has successfully self-served through the virtual agent. You measure this by setting the appropriate flow reporting status on certain nodes within a flow. Learn more: [How do I determine flow success?](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/best-practices#measuring-virtual-agents "Measuring Virtual Agents")

To set flow reporting status for response nodes:

1. Toggle **Set flow reporting status** on.
2. By default, **Success** is selected for response nodes but this can be modified for your particular flow.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-0f71f580-39ab-009d-9a6a-8fcc3dffbd8d.jpg" />
</Frame>

### Login Node

The **Login Node** enables customer authentication within a flow. In this node, you can define the following:

* **Content**
* **Routing**
* **Advanced Settings**

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-d6a3bc59-4453-bb6d-5eb7-3ad75343e33f.jpg" />
</Frame>

#### Content

The **Content** section allows you to define the text to be shown to the customer to accompany the login action. All login nodes will have default text which you can modify to suit your particular flow needs.

* **Message text**: Define the main text that will prompt the customer to login
* **Call to action**: Define the accompanying text that the customer will click on in order to login
* **Text sent to indicate that a login is in process**: customize the text that is sent after the customer has tried to log in.

In the flow graph, you can preview how the content will be displayed to the customer.

#### Routing

Flows cannot end on a login node. The **Routing** section is where you can configure what happens after a customer successfully logs in or optionally configure branches for exceptional conditions.

##### On login

In the **On login** section, you must define the default routing rule that will execute after the customer successfully logs in.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-4f888e5e-6173-307c-8153-6e6267fad35e.png" />
</Frame>

##### On response

Similar to response nodes, you can optionally add response branches in the **On response** section to account for exceptional conditions that may occur when a customer is trying to authenticate, such as login errors or retries and refreshes.

Please see [Branch Classifiers](#branch-classifiers "Branch Classifiers") on the response node for more information on how to configure these routing rules.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-dd1d24fc-c9d3-eb94-551f-0f484dfdfc7a.png" />
</Frame>

##### Else

In the **Else** section, you can define what happens if login is unsuccessful and we do not recognize customer responses.

#### Advanced Settings

In **Advanced Settings**, you have the option to **Force reauthentication** which will prompt all customers to log in again, regardless of current authentication state.

### API Node

The API node allows you to use API fields dynamically in your flows. The data you retrieve on an API node can be used for two things:

1. **Displaying the data** on subsequent nodes.
2. **Routing to different nodes** based on the data.

#### Data Request

The **Data Request** section allows you to add data fields from an existing API integration.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-1afa3ec6-da35-0ba0-403d-abcd778b2055.png" />
</Frame>

Select **Add data fields** to choose objects from existing integrations, which will allow you to add collections of data fields to the node. There is a search bar that allows you to easily search through the available fields.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-6bd04609-3365-b170-5abd-10e137481de3.png" />
</Frame>

After you select objects, all of the referenced fields will automatically populate in the API node.

In addition to objects and arrays, you can request actions.

<Note>
  You can only select one action per node; selecting an action will automatically disable the selection of additional objects, actions, and arrays.
</Note>

#### Input Parameters

Some actions require input parameters for the API call, which you can define in AI-Console. In the node edit panel, you can see a field for defining parameters that will be passed as part of the API call. This field leverages curly brackets: click the **curly bracket** icon or select the **shift>\{** or **}** keys to choose the API value to pass as an input parameter.

<Note>
  Only valid data can be used for input parameters; objects or arrays will not be surfaced through curly brackets.
</Note>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-02e0a722-3e1c-4c35-bffd-3c9a83368472.png" />
</Frame>

#### Displaying Data

You are easily able to display API fields from an API node in subsequent response nodes. This field leverages curly brackets: click the **curly bracket** icon or select the **shift>\{** or **}** keys in the Response Node Content section to choose API values to display, which will render as a dynamic API field in the flow graph.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-269410d7-d017-6c4b-df6f-f4a8ec743a8f.png" />
</Frame>

When you click on the API field itself, data format options appear that will allow you to specify exactly what format to display to the end user.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-e456368d-92a6-a6ee-0df0-6df089265ac0.png" />
</Frame>

#### Routing to Different Nodes

Routing and data operators allow you to specify different flow branching based on what is returned from an API. This leverages the same framework as routing on other nodes, but provides additional functionality around operators to give you flexibility in configuring routing conditions.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-859bd96a-74c6-3435-abfd-d39baf90ffa0.png" />
</Frame>

Operators allow you to contextually define conditions to route on.

#### Error Handling

API nodes provide default error handling, but you are able to create custom error handling on the node itself if desired. You can specify where a user should be directed in the event of an error with the API call.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-9bbe352a-b20c-b737-ee22-76aa11d6bc6e.png" />
</Frame>

#### API Library

API fields are available under the integrations menu. In this page, you can view and search through all available objects and associated data fields.

### Redirect Node

The **Redirect Node** serves to link flows with one another by directing the customer to a separate flow. A Redirect Node does not display content to the customer.

In this node, you can define the following:

* **Destination**
* **Routing**
* **Advanced Settings**

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-7cd585e4-f3dc-f4f5-7f0d-959444c1e7d7.jpg" />
</Frame>

#### Destination

The **Destination** section allows you to define where to redirect the customer. You can redirect to an existing **flow** or an **intent**.

* Select **Flow** to redirect to an individual flow destination.
* Select **Intent** to redirect the customer to solve for a broader issue intent that may route them to different flows depending on the [intent routing rules](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing "Intent Routing").

Depending on the option you select, you will be able to select the destination flow or intent from the dropdown.

#### Routing (Return Upon Completion)

Redirect nodes can end your flow or you can choose to have the customer return your flow after the destination flow has completed. To do so, toggle on **Return upon completion**. After doing so, you can define the default routing rule that will execute upon customer return.

### Agent Node

The **Agent Node** enables you to direct the customer to an agent queue in order to help resolve their issue. The data associated with this customer will be used to determine the live agent queue to put them in.

#### Advanced Settings

In the Advanced Settings section, you can set flow success reporting for the agent node.

##### Flow Success

Flow success attempts to accurately measure whether a customer has successfully self-served through the virtual agent. This is measured by setting the appropriate flow reporting status on certain nodes within a flow. Learn more: [How do I determine flow success?](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/best-practices#measuring-virtual-agents "Measuring Virtual Agents")

For agent nodes, this is always considered a failure.

To set flow reporting status for agent nodes:

1. Toggle **Set flow reporting status** on.
2. By default, **Failure** will be selected for agent nodes

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-59f2fa3b-2f13-9a04-9e50-9145adfe99ff.jpg" />
</Frame>

### End Node

The **End Node** wraps up the conversation by confirming whether the customer needs additional help.

#### Advanced Settings

In the **Advanced Settings** section, you can select the end Semantic Response Score (SRS) options (see below) for your flow.

By default, all three options will be selected when an end node is added, thus presenting all three options for the customer to select from. You can expand the section to modify these options to present to the customer.

##### End SRS Options

At the end of a flow, the virtual agent will ask the customer: "Is there anything else we can help you with today?"\*

After the above message is sent, there are three options available for the customer to select from:

* **"Thanks, I'm all set"**
  A customer selecting this **positive** option will prompt the virtual agent to wrap up and resolve the issue.
* **"I have another question"**
  A customer selecting this **neutral** option will prompt the virtual agent to ask the customer what their question is.
* **"My question has not been answered"**
  A customer selecting this **negative** option will prompt the virtual agent to escalate the customer into agent chat to help resolve their issue.
  \*Exact end SRS options and text may vary. Please contact your ASAPP team for more details.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-015c83bb-4604-d342-9502-495ecdfe6b53.jpg" />
</Frame>

## Quick Start: Flows

### Create Flow

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-23846669-6400-d259-9dd6-c05a934628c4.png" />
</Frame>

Click **Create** to trigger a dialog for creating a new flow. The following data must be provided:

* **Name:** Give a unique name for your flow, using letters and numbers only.
* **Description:** Give a brief description of the purpose of the flow.

<Tip>
  Avoid vague flow names. Using clear names & descriptions allow others to quickly distinguish the purpose of your flow. We recommend following an "Objective +**Topic**" naming convention, such as: Find **Food** or Pay **Bill**.
</Tip>

Click **Next** to go to the flow builder where you will design and build your flow using the various [node types](#node-types "Node Types").

### Preview Flow

You can preview your flow as you are building it!

In the toolbar, select the **eye** icon to open the in-line preview. This panel will then allow you to preview the version of the flow that is currently displayed. As you are actively editing a flow, select this icon at any time to preview your progress.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-2b6a0023-418f-349a-12de-97db59756c41.gif" />
</Frame>

To preview a previously saved version of the flow, navigate to the flow version in the [version dropdown](#version-indicators "Version Indicators"), then click the **eye** icon to preview.

#### Preview Capabilities

There are a few capabilities to leverage in preview:

* **Re-setting:** puts you back to the first node of the flow and allows you to test it again.
* **Debug information:** opens a panel that provides more detailed insights into where you are in a flow and the associated metadata with your preview.
* **Close:** close the in-line preview.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-dec4da7d-9bec-9a29-7db9-6c4753edefd4.gif" />
</Frame>

#### Preview with Mocked Data

The real time preview also has the ability to preview integrated flows using mocked data. By mocking data directly in the preview, you can test different flow paths based on the different values an API can return.

1. Define Request
   * You can define if the request is a success or failure when previewing. Each API node is treated as a separate call in the preview experience.
   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-cc121ffe-4697-fdb1-03b1-2980bac31e27.png" />
   </Frame>
2. View and Edit Mock Data Fields

   * For a successful API call, you can view and edit mock data fields, which will inform the subsequent flow path in the preview.
   * By default, all returned values are selected and pre-filled. Values set in the preview will be cached until you leave the flow builder, to prevent the need to re-enter each mock data form.

   <Frame>
     <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-fe3f5af7-9ac8-9360-a9a3-e60a0df2dd16.png" />
   </Frame>

### Save New Flow

When you are building a new flow, the following buttons will display in the toolbar:

* **Discard changes:** remove all unsaved changes made to the flow.
* **Save:** save changes to the flow as a new version or override an existing version.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-a6181873-136b-6d04-a38a-242e99e922e0.png" />
</Frame>

To save your new flow, select **Save**.

### Deploy New Flow

Newly created flows (i.e. the initial version) will **immediately deploy to test environments and production**. These new flows can be deployed without harm since customers will not be able to invoke the flow unless there are incoming routes due to [intent routing](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing "Intent Routing").

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-8b66727a-30bd-703f-b094-cbd7ead452eb.png" />
</Frame>

### Test New Flow

After deploying your flow to test, navigate to your respective test environment in order to verify your flow changes:

1. In the upper right corner of the toolbar, click the icon for **More actions**.
2. Select **Copy link to demo**.
3. Copy the **Flow Shortcut**.
4. Choose to **Go to demo env.**
5. Once there, select the chat bubble and paste the flow shortcut into the text entry to start testing your flow.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-816ae3d2-cfd5-ee62-9836-a9cda9b906e0.gif" />
</Frame>

### Edit & Save New Version

You can make changes to your new flow by selecting a node and making edits in the [Node Configuration Panel](#node-configuration-panel "Node Configuration Panel").

Once you are ready to save your changes, select **Save**. Since the current version of the flow is already deployed to production, you will **NOT** be able to save over the current version and **MUST** save as a new version to prevent unintentional changes to flows in production.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-3111bc91-7f92-b557-7111-4b8dd2be242b.png" />
</Frame>

For future flow versions that are not deployed to production, you will be able to save your changes as a **new flow version** or to overwrite the **current flow version**.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-515f5f10-8a76-5910-5f97-2dc89d381378.png" />
</Frame>

### Deploy Version to Test

After saving, you will be directed to **Manage Versions** where you will manage which flow version is deployed to test environments and to production..

<Caution>
  All flows should be verified in test environments, such as demo or pre-production environments before production. Therefore, new flow versions **MUST** be deployed to test **PRIOR** to [deployment in production](#deploy-version-to-prod "Deploy Version to Prod").
</Caution>

To deploy a flow version to test environments:

1. Select the new version you want to deploy in the version dropdown for **Test**.
2. After selection, click **Save**.
3. Flow version will deploy to all lower test environments within 5-10 minutes.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-75491e14-8dfe-c56c-c837-a68c6e2c37e8.png" />
</Frame>

### Test Version

After deploying your flow to test, navigate to your respective test environment in order to verify your flow changes:

1. In the upper right corner of the toolbar, click the icon for **More actions**.
2. Select **Copy link to demo**.
3. Copy the **Flow Shortcut**.
4. Choose to **Go to demo env**.
5. Once there, select the chat bubble and paste the flow shortcut into the text entry to start testing your flow.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-bd6031aa-5804-3dbe-9039-33c57496abd3.gif" />
</Frame>

### Deploy Version to Prod

After verifying the expected flow behavior in **Test**, you can deploy the flow version to production, which will impact customers if there the [flow is routed from an intent](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing "Intent Routing"):

1. Select the version you want to deploy in the version dropdown for **Prod**.

### Manage Versions

When you are simply viewing a flow without making any changes, **Manage Versions** will always be at the top of the toolbar for you to manage flow version deployments. Upon selection, the versions that are currently deployed to Test and Prod environments will display, which you can edit as appropriate.

</Frame>

In addition to version deployments, you can view any existing [intents that route to this flow](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing "Intent Routing") in **Incoming Routes**. Upon selection, you will be directed to the specific [intent detail](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing#intent-routing-detail-page "Intent Routing Detail Page") page where you can view the intent routing rules.

### Navigate Flow Versions

Many flows may iterate through multiple versions. You can toggle to view previous flow versions using the version dropdown:

1. Next to the flow name, click the version dropdown in the toolbar.
2. Selecting the version you want to view.
3. Once selected, the version details will display in the flow graph.
4. You can click any node to start editing that specific flow version.

#### Version Indicators

As flow versions are iteratively edited and deployed to Test and Prod, there are a few indicators in the toolbar to help the you quickly understand which version is being edited and which versions have been deployed to an environment:

* **Unsaved changes**
  If the version is denoted with an asterisk along with a filled gray indicator of "Unsaved Changes", the flow version is currently being edited and must be saved before navigating away from the page.

</Frame>

* **Unreleased version**
  If a version is denoted with a hollow *gray* indicator *Unreleased version* , the flow version is saved but not deployed to any environment.

</Frame>

* **Available in test**
  If a version is denoted with a hollow *orange* indicator of *Available in test*, the flow version is deployed to test environments (e.g. demo) but it is **not routed** from an intent.

</Frame>

* **Available in prod**
  If a version is denoted with a hollow *green* indicator of *Available in prod*, the flow version is deployed to the production environment but it is **not routed** from an intent.

<Frame>

</Frame>

* **Live in prod**
  If a version is denoted with a filled *green* indicator of *Live in prod*, the flow version is deployed to the production environment and it **is routed from an intent which can be reached by customers**.

# Intent Routing
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/intent-routing

Learn how to route intents to flows or agents.

Intents are the set of reasons that a customer might contact your business and are recognized by the virtual agent when the customer first reaches out. Our ASAPP teams work with you to optimize your intent list on an ongoing basis.

Within intent routing, you can view the full list of intents and the routing behavior after an intent is recognized. Creators have the ability to modify this behavior.

## Navigate to Intent Routing

You can access **Intent Routing** in the **Virtual Agent** navigation panel.

</Frame>

## Intent Routing List

On the intent routing page, you will find a filterable list of intents along with their routing information. The following information is displayed in the table:

1. **Intent name:** displays the name of the intent, as well as a brief description on what it is.
2. **Code:** unique identifier for each intent.
3. **Routing:** displays the flow routing rules currently configured for an intent, if available.
   a. If the intent is routed to one or more flows, the column will list such flow(s).
   b. If the intent is not routed to any flow, the column will display an 'Add Route...'. These intents will immediately direct customers to an agent queue.

</Frame>

## Intent Routing Detail Page

Clicking on a specific intent in the list will direct you to a page where routing behavior for the intent can be defined. The intent detail page is broken down as follows:

1. **Routing behavior**
2. **Conditional rules and default flow**
3. **Intent information**
4. **Intent toolbar**

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-84f63b73-4877-f487-44e2-4a27f19956d9.jpg" />
</Frame>

### Routing Behavior

Routing behavior for a specific intent is determined by selecting one of the following options:

1. **Route to a live agent**
   When the intent is identified, the customer will be immediately directed to an agent queue. This is the default selection for any new intents unless configured otherwise.
2. **Route to a flow**
   When the intent is identified, the customer will be directed to a flow in accordance with the [conditional rules](#conditional-rules-and-default-flow) that you will subsequently define.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-2ca3faf8-99e8-e73f-c913-74597e8ea743.jpg" />
</Frame>

### Conditional Rules and Default Flow

If an intent is configured to be [routed to a flow](#routing-behavior), you have the option to build conditional rules and route to a flow only when the conditions are validated TRUE. If all the conditional rules are invalid, customers will be routed to a [default flow](#default-flow) of your choosing.

#### Add Conditional Route

To add a new conditional route:

1. Select **Add Conditional Route**.
2. Define a conditional statement in the **Conditional Route** editor by:
   a. Selecting an available [attribute](/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/attributes) as target from the drop-down menu and choose the value to validate against. E.g. authentication equals true.
   i. Multiple conditions can be added by clicking **Add Conditions**. Once added, they can be reordered by dragging, or deleted by clicking the trash can icon.
   b. Selecting the flow to route customers to, if the conditions are validated in the dropdown.
   c. Click **Apply** to save your changes.
3. Edit or delete a route by hovering over the route and selecting the respective icons.

</Frame>

#### Multiple Conditional Routes

You can add multiple conditional rules that can route to different flows. You can reorder these conditions by dragging the conditional rule from the icon on the left. Once saved, conditions are evaluated from top to bottom, with the customer being routed to the first flow for which the conditions are validated. If no conditional route is valid, the customer will be routed to the [default flow](#default-flow).

</Frame>

#### Default Flow

A default flow must be selected if the routing behavior is defined to [route to a flow](#routing-behavior).

Customers will be routed to the selected default flow if no conditional routes exist, or if none of the conditional routes were valid.

</Frame>

### Intent Information

The **Intent Information** panel will display the intent name, code, and description for easy reference as you are viewing or editing intent routes.

The **Assigned routes** will display any flow(s) that are currently routed from the intent.

### Intent Toolbar

When you are editing intent routing, the following buttons will display in the toolbar:

* **Discard changes**: remove all unsaved changes.
* **Save**: save changes to intent routing.

## Save Intent Routing

To save any changes to intent routing, click **Save** from the toolbar. By default, when saving an intent route, it is immediately released to production. There is currently no versioning available when saving intent routes.

</Frame>

### Test a Different Intent Route in Test Environments

To avoid impacting customer routing and assignments in production you can test a particular intent route in a test environment before releasing it to customers by following the steps below:

* In the **Conditional Route** editor, add a condition that targets the 'InTest' attribute.
  a. The value assigned to 'InTest' should equal 'TRUE'.
  b. Select the flow that you want to test the routing for.
  c. Click **Apply**.

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Test Intent Routes

Intent routes can be tested in demo environments. To test an intent route:

1. Access your demo environment.
2. Type `INTENT_INTENTCODE`, where `INTENTCODE` is the code associated with the intent you want to test. Please note that this is case sensitive.
3. Press **Enter** to test intent routes for that intent.


# Links
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/messaging-platform/virtual-agent/links

Learn how to manage external links and URLs that direct customers to web pages.

ASAPP provides a powerful mechanism to manage external links and URLs that direct customers to web pages. Links are predominantly used in flows, core dialogs, and customer profiles.

## Links List

The Links list page displays a list of all links available to use in AI-Console. When a link is created, it can be attached to content in a node in Flow Tooling, included in the Customer Profile panels, assigned to a View, etc.

Here, you'll find the **Link name & URL**. When adding a link to a flow or other feature, you will be required to add it from a list of all link names.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/images/messaging-platform/LinksPage.png" />
</Frame>

## Create a Link

To create a link:

1. From the **Links** landing page, click the **+** button at the bottom right.
2. A modal window will open.
3. **Link name:** Provide a name for the link. Make the name descriptive so that other users can recognize its purpose.
4. **URL:** Include the full external URL, including **http\://** (e.g., `http://example.com/about`).
5. **Channel Targets:** This feature is optional. It allows users to create a link variant that targets customers using a specific channel. See details below.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-39985f99-da5e-8997-87ba-dda6b9156a76.png" />
</Frame>

### Add a Channel Target Variant

1. Click **Add Channel Target** to add a URL variant. A new input field will be added.
   a. **URL Override:** Include the URL variant for the targeted channel. Please follow the same URL syntax as described under **Create a Link**.
   b. **Channel Target:** From the drop-down menu, select which channel to target. Bear in mind that a single variant per channel is currently supported.
2. **Delete targets:** To remove a target, click the **Delete** icon.
3. **Save:** To save the link, click the **Save** button. The link will not be active until it is assigned to a flow, customer profile or any other feature that supports **Links**.
4. **Cancel:** On click, all changes will be cleared.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-86cb8d7f-ba8f-6c01-8926-4f0cae6d3b80.png" />
</Frame>

### Link Assignments

Once a link has been created, it can be sent to customers in flows. The **Links** feature will keep tabs on where each link has been assigned and provide quick access to those feature areas.

When viewing a specific link, the Usage section indicates which flows are currently using the respective link. On click, you can navigate directly to the flow. When a link is not assigned in any flow, 'Not yet assigned' will be displayed.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-80058a33-eb5c-5c76-3e89-8e7a35b2a5af.png" />
</Frame>

## Edit a Link

Link changes are global, which means that saved changes are immediately pushed to all features that reference the link.

1. From the **Links** landing page, click the **link name** you want to edit.
2. **Link ID:** After a link is saved for the first time, a unique identifier is automatically assigned to the link. This identifier does not change over time, including when the link is edited.
   a. The **Link ID** can be referenced in **Historical Reporting** for your reporting needs.
3. Assign changes to the configurations.
4. **Save:** When changes are complete, click **Save** to automatically apply the changes.

## Delete a Link

Links can be deleted, but only if they are not currently assigned. To delete a link that is assigned, remove the assignments first.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-bdf4a69c-fadd-918a-e277-aa4f7c3826eb.png" />
</Frame>

1. If the link is assigned: When opening the Link modal, the **Delete** button will be disabled. The delete function will remain disabled until all link assignments have been removed.
2. If the link is not assigned: The link can be deleted by clicking on the **Delete** button on the bottom-left area of the link modal.


# Reporting and Insights

ASAPP reports data back via several channels, each with different use cases:

  <Card title="S3 Reports" href="/reporting/retrieve-messaging-data">Download data and reports via S3.</Card>

  <Card title="Metadata Ingestion" href="/reporting/metadata-ingestion">Send conversation, agent, and customer metadata.</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Batch vs Realtime

One high-level differentiating feature of these channels is how the underlying data is processed for reporting:

* **Real-time**: Processed data flows to the reporting channel as it happens.
* **Batch**: Processed data aggregates into time-based buckets, delivered with some delay to the reporting channel.

For reference:

* Reports visible in ASAPP's Desk/Admin are considered *real-time reports*.
* RTCI reports are *real-time reports*.
* ASAPP's S3 reports are *batch reports,* delivered with a predictable time delay.
* Historical Reports are *batch reports*.

Often, metrics similar in both name and in underlying definition are delivered both via batch and via real-time channels.

This can be confusing: a metric in viewed in a real-time context (say, via ASAPP's Desk/Admin) might well differ in value from a similar metric viewed in a time-delayed batch context (say, via a report delivered by S3).

***In fact, customers should not expect that values for similar metrics will line up across real-time and batch reporting channels.***

The short explanation for such differences is that **real-time and batch processed metrics are necessarily calculated using different underlying data sets** (with the real-time set current up-to-the-minute, and the batch set delayed as a function of the time bucketing aggregation).

It is expected that different underlying data will yield different reported values for your metrics between delivery channels.

The balance of this document provides a few concrete examples to further explain the variance you will typically see between real-time and batch reported values for similar metrics.

### Batch vs Real-time Metric Discrepancies

Real-time metrics are calculated with a continual process, where computations are evaluated repeatedly with the most current data available.

With multiple active and potentially geographically dispersed instances of an application communicating asynchronously across a global message bus, at times the data used to calculate real-time metrics can be intermediate or incomplete.

On the other hand, metrics computed using batch processing are computed with all available, terminal data for each reported interaction, and so can provide a more accurate metric at the expense of a time delay vs real-time reporting.

ASAPP S3 reports, for example, are normally computed over hours or days, and can therefore incorporate the most complete set of data points required to calculate a metric.

As a simplified example, let's consider a metric that shows a daily average for customer satisfaction ratings. Let's assume:

* the day starts at 8:00AM
* batch processing works against hourly aggregate buckets
* batch calculations run at 5 minutes past the hour
* it is a *very slow* day :)

Over the course of our pretend day, the following interactions are handled by the system:

| TIME     | Rating | Real-time avg for day | batch avg for day |
| :------- | :----- | :-------------------- | :---------------- |
| 8:00 AM  | 4      | 4                     | N/A               |
| 8:05 AM  | 4      | 4                     | N/A               |
| 8:10 AM  | 4      | 4                     | N/A               |
| 12:00 PM | 1      | 3.25                  | 4                 |
| 12:05 PM | 1      | 2.8                   | 4                 |
| 1:10 PM  | 4      | 3                     | 2.8               |

At 8:00 AM, batch processing will not have incorporated the rating that was provided at 8:00AM. So the average rating can't be computed for a batch report. Since real-time reporting has access to up-to-the-minute data, real-time reporting shows a value of 4 for the daily average customer satisfaction rating.

At 12:00PM, the real-time metric shows an average satisfaction over 4 transactions as 3.25. The batch system shows the average satisfaction rating as 4 over 3 transactions, since the 12:00 transaction has not yet been incorporated into the batch processing calculation. Given our example scenario, the interactions at 12:00 and 12:05 would not be incorporated into the batch reported metric until 1:05PM.

In this simplified example, the batch processed metric would align with the real-time metric around 2:05 PM, once both the batch metric and the real-time metric are calculated against the same underlying data set.

The next example shows how values provided by real-time vs batch processing might show inconsistent values for "rep assigned time".

```json
8:00AM: NEW ISSUE
8:01AM: ENQUEUED
8:02AM: REP ASSIGNED: rep0
8:03AM: REP UNASSIGNED
8:04AM: REENQUEUED
8:05AM: REP ASSIGNED: rep0
8:06AM: ...
```

With real time reporting, the value for rep\_assigned\_time might show either 8:02AM or 8:05AM, depending on when the data is read and the real-time metric is viewed.

Batch processed data, however, will have the complete historical data, and so will consistently report 8:02AM for the rep\_assigned\_time.

Batch processed data and real-time processed data are almost always looking at different underlying data sets. Batch data is complete but time-delayed and real-time data is up-to-the-minute but not necessarily complete.

As long as the data sets underlying real-time vs. batch reporting differ, customers should expect that the metrics calculated from those different data sets will differ more often than not.

### Table: csid\_containment

The csid\_containment table tracks and organizes customer interactions by associating them with a unique session identifier (csid) with 30min window time frame. It consolidates data related to customer sessions, including associated issue\_ids, session durations, and indicators of containment success. Containment success measures whether an issue was resolved within a session without escalation. This table is critical for analyzing customer interaction patterns, evaluating the effectiveness of issue resolution processes, and identifying areas for improvement.

**Sync Time:** 1h

**Unique Condition:** csid, company\_name

### Table: csid\_containment\_1d

The csid\_containment table tracks and organizes customer interactions by associating them with a unique session identifier (csid) with 24 hours of window timeframe. It consolidates data related to customer sessions, including associated issue\_ids, session durations, and indicators of containment success. Containment success measures whether an issue was resolved within a session without escalation. This table is critical for analyzing customer interaction patterns, evaluating the effectiveness of issue resolution processes, and identifying areas for improvement.

**Sync Time:** 1h

**Unique Condition:** csid, company\_name

| instance\_ts         | timestamp                | The time window of computed elements.  This window is usually 15 minutes or 1 hour depending on the generation time. Times are rounded down to the nearest interval (for a time of 12:34 and an interval of 15m, this is 12:30). As an example, for a 15 minute interval an instance\_ts of 12:30 implies events from 12:30 -> 12:45.

| instance\_ts                | timestamp                   | The time window of computed elements.  This window is usually 15 minutes or 1 hour depending on the generation time. Times are rounded down to the nearest interval (for a time of 12:34 and an interval of 15m, this is 12:30). As an example, for a 15 minute interval an instance\_ts of 12:30 implies events from 12:30 -> 12:45.

### Table: rep\_activity

The rep\_activity table tracks status and slot information of each agent over time, including time spent in each status and time utilized in chats. In this table, the data is captured in 15 minute increments throughout the day. instance\_ts is actually the 15-minute window in question, and is part of the primary key. It does not indicate the last time a relevant event happened as in other tables. Windows may be re-stated when information from a later window amends them, for example to account for additional utilized time.

### Table: rep\_utilized

The rep\_utilized table tracks a rep's activity and how much time they spend in each state. It shows utilization time and total minutes per state, recorded in 15-minute intervals throughout the day. The instance\_ts field represents the 15-minute window and is part of the primary key. It doesn’t show the most recent event like in other tables. The data may be updated if later information changes it, such as adding more utilization time. Utilization refers to the rep’s efficiency.

# File Exporter
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/reporting/file-exporter

Learn how to use File Exporter to retrieve data from Standalone ASAPP Services.

Use ASAPP's File Exporter service to securely retrieve AI Services data via API. The service provides a specific link to access the requested data based on the file parameters of the request that include the feed, version, format, date, and time interval of interest.

The File Exporter service is meant to be used as a batch mechanism for exporting data to your data warehouse, either on a scheduled basis (e.g. nightly, weekly) or for ad hoc analyses. Data that populates feeds for the File Exporter service updates once daily at 2:00AM UTC.

<Note>
  Data feeds are not available by default. Reach out to your ASAPP account contact to ensure data feeds are enabled for your implementation.
</Note>

## Before You Begin

To use ASAPP's APIs, all apps must be registered through the AI Services Developer Portal. Once registered, each app will be provided unique API keys for ongoing use.

<Tip>
  Get your API credentials and learn how to set up AI Service APIs by visiting our [Developer Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/developers).
</Tip>

## Endpoints

The File Exporter service uses six parameters to specify a target file:

* `feed`: The name of the data feed of interest
* `version`: The version number of the feed
* `format`: The file format
* `date`: The date of interest
* `interval`: The time interval of interest
* `fileName`: The data file name

Each parameter is retrieved from a dedicated endpoint. Once all parameters are retrieved, the target file is retrieved using the endpoint (`/fileexporter/v1/static/getfeedfile`), which takes these parameters in the request and returns a URL.

* `POST` `/fileexporter/v1/static/listfeeds`
  Use this endpoint to retrieve an array of feed names available for your implementation.
* `POST` `/fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedversions`
  Use this endpoint to retrieve an array of versions available for a given data feed.
* `POST` `/fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedformats`
  Use this endpoint to retrieve an array of available file formats for a given feed and version.
* `POST` `/fileexporter/v1/static/listfeeddates`
  Use this endpoint to retrieve an array of available dates for a given feed/version/format.
* `POST` `/fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedintervals`
  Use this endpoint to retrieve an array of available intervals for a given feed/version/format/date.
* `POST` `/fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedfiles`
  Use this endpoint to retrieve an array of file names for a given feed/version/format/date/interval.
* `POST` `/fileexporter/v1/static/getfeedfile`
  Use this endpoint to retrieve a single file URL for the data specified using parameters returned from the above endpoints.

<Tip>
  Values for `file` will differ based on the requested `date` and `interval` parameters. Always call this endpoint prior to calling `/getfeedfile`.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  In the `getfeedfile` request, all parameters are required except `interval`
</Tip>

### Endpoint List

1. `POST /fileexporter/v1/static/listfeeds`
   Retrieve an array of feed names available for your implementation.

2. `POST /fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedversions`
   Retrieve an array of versions available for a given data feed.

3. `POST /fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedformats`
   Retrieve an array of available file formats for a given feed and version.

4. `POST /fileexporter/v1/static/listfeeddates`
   Retrieve an array of available dates for a given feed/version/format.

5. `POST /fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedintervals`
   Retrieve an array of available intervals for a given feed/version/format/date.

6. `POST /fileexporter/v1/static/listfeedfiles`
   Retrieve an array of file names for a given feed/version/format/date/interval.

   <Tip>
     Values for `file` will differ based on the requested `date` and `interval` parameters. Always call this endpoint prior to calling `/getfeedfile`.
   </Tip>

7. `POST /fileexporter/v1/static/getfeedfile`
   Retrieve a single file URL for the data specified using parameters returned from the above endpoints.

   <Tip>
     In the `getfeedfile` request, all parameters are required except `interval`
   </Tip>

## Making Routine Requests

Only two requests are needed for exporting data on an ongoing basis for different timeframes. To export a file each time, make these two calls:

1. Call `/listfeedfiles`
   using the same `feed`, `version`, `format` parameters, and alter the `date` and `interval` parameters as necessary (`interval` is optional) to specify the time period of the data file you wish to retrieve.
   In response, you will receive the name(s) of the `file` needed for making the next request.

2. Call `/getfeedfile`
   with the same parameters as above and the `file` name parameter returned from `/listfeedfiles`. In response, you will receive the access `url`.

3. Call `/listfeedfiles` using the same `feed`, `version`, `format` parameters, and alter the `date` and `interval` parameters as necessary (`interval` is optional) to specify the time period of the data file you wish to retrieve. In response, you will receive the name(s) of the `file` needed for making the next request.

4. Call `/getfeedfile` with the same parameters as above and the `file` name parameter returned from `/listfeedfiles`. In response, you will receive the access `url`.

Your final request to `/getfeedfile` for the file `url` would look like this:

```json
{
  "feed": "feed_test",
  "version": "version=1",
  "format": "format=jsonl",
  "date": "dt=2022-06-27",
  "fileName": "file1.jsonl"
}
```

## Data Feeds

File Exporter makes the following data feeds available:

1. **Conversation State**: `staging_conversation_state`
   Combines ASAPP conversation identifiers with metadata including summaries, augmentation counts, intent, crafting times, and important timestamps.
2. **Utterance State**: `staging_utterance_state`
   Combines ASAPP utterance identifiers with metadata including sender type, augmentations, crafting times, and important timestamps. **NOTE:** Does not include utterance text.
3. **Utterances**: `utterances`
   Combines ASAPP conversation and utterance identifiers with utterance text and timestamps. Identifiers can be used to join utterance text with metadata from utterance state feed.
4. **Free-Text Summaries**: `autosummary_free_text`
   Retrieves data from free-text summaries generated by AutoSummary. This feed has one record per free-text summary produced and can have multiple summaries per conversation .
5. **Feedback**: `autosummary_feedback`
   Retrieves the text of the feedback submitted by the agent. Developers can join this feed to the AutoSummary free-text feed using the summary ID.
6. **Structured Data**: `autosummary_structured_data`
   Retrieves structured data to extract information and insights from conversations in the form of yes/no answers (up to 20) from summaries generated by AutoSummary.

| instance\_ts                      | timestamp    | The time window of computed elements.  This window is usually 15 minutes or 1 hour depending on the generation time. Times are rounded down to the nearest interval (for a time of 12:34 and an interval of 15m, this is 12:30). As an example, for a 15 minute interval an instance\_ts of 12:30 implies events from 12:30 -> 12:45.

### Table: utterances

This S3 captures raw utterances, enabling customers to map message IDs and metadata to specific utterances. Each record in this feed represents an individual message within a conversation, providing utterance-level insights. The feed remains minimal and secure, including a comprehensive mapping of message IDs to their corresponding utterances, information not available in the utterance state file. For security purposes, this feed will only be accessible externally, retaining a maximum of 32 days of data before purging. The feed will be exported daily, with time-stamped data for time zone conversion.

**Sync Time:** 1d

**Unique Condition:** company\_marker, conversation\_id, message\_id

# Metadata Ingestion API
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/reporting/metadata-ingestion

Learn how to send metadata via Metadata Ingestion API.

Customers with AI Services implementations use ASAPP's Metadata Ingestion API to send key attributes about conversations, customers, and agents. Metadata can be joined with AI Service output data to sort and filter reports and analyses using attributes important to your business.

<Note>
  Metadata Ingestion API is not accessible by default. Reach out to your ASAPP account contact to ensure it is enabled for your implementation.
</Note>

## Before You Begin

ASAPP provides an AI Services [Developer Portal](/getting-started/developers). Within the portal, developers can:

* Access relevant API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI reference schemas)
* Access API keys for authorization
* Manage user accounts and apps

In order to use ASAPP's APIs, all apps must be registered through the portal. Once registered, each app will be provided unique API keys for ongoing use.

<Tip>
  Visit the [Get Started](/getting-started/developers) page on the Developer Portal for instructions on creating a developer account, managing teams and apps, and setup for using AI Service APIs.
</Tip>

## Endpoints

The Metadata Ingestion endpoints are used to send information about agents, conversations, and customers. Metadata can be sent for a single entity (e.g., one agent) or for multiple entities at once (e.g., several hundred agents) in a batch format.

### Agent

The OpenAPI specification for each agent endpoint shows the types of metadata that are accepted. Examples include information about lines of business, groups, locations, supervisors, languages spoken, vendor, job role, and email.

The endpoints also accept custom-defined `attributes` in key-value pairs if no existing field in the schema suits the type of metadata you wish to upload.

* [`POST /metadata-ingestion/v1/single-agent-metadata`](/apis/metadata/add-an-agent-metadata)
  * Use this endpoint to add metadata for a single agent.

* [`POST /metadata-ingestion/v1/many-agent-metadata`](/apis/metadata/add-multiple-agent-metadata)
  * Use this endpoint to add metadata for a batch of agents all at once.

### Conversation

The OpenAPI specification for each conversation endpoint shows the types of metadata that are accepted. Examples include unique identifiers, lines of business, group and subdivision identifiers, routing codes, associated campaigns and business rules, browser and device information.

The endpoints also accept custom-defined `attributes` in key-value pairs if no existing field in the schema suits the type of metadata you wish to upload.

* [`POST /metadata-ingestion/v1/single-convo-metadata`](/apis/metadata/add-a-conversation-metadata)
  * Use this endpoint to add metadata for a single conversation.

* [`POST /metadata-ingestion/v1/many-convo-metadata`](/apis/metadata/add-multiple-conversation-metadata)
  * Use this endpoint to add metadata for a batch of conversations all at once.

### Customer

The OpenAPI specification for each customer endpoint shows the types of metadata that are accepted. Examples include unique identifiers, statuses, contact details, and location information.

The endpoints also accept custom-defined `attributes` in key-value pairs if no existing field in the schema suits the type of metadata you wish to upload.

* [`POST /metadata-ingestion/v1/single-customer-metadata`](/apis/metadata/add-a-customer-metadata)
  * Use this endpoint to add metadata for a single customer.

* [`POST /metadata-ingestion/v1/many-customer-metadata`](/apis/metadata/add-multiple-customer-metadata)
  * Use this endpoint to add metadata for a batch of customers all at once.


# Building a Real-Time Event API
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/reporting/real-time-event-api

Learn how to implement ASAPP's real-time event API to receive activity, journey, and queue state updates.

ASAPP provides real-time access to events, enabling customers to power internal use cases.

Typical use cases that benefit from real-time ASAPP events include:

* Tracking the end-user journey through ASAPP
* Supporting workforce management needs
* Integrating with customer-maintained CRM systems

ASAPP's real-time events provide raw data. Complex processing, such as aggregation or deduplication, is handled by batch analytics and reporting.

ASAPP presently supports three real-time event feeds:

1. **Activity**: Agent status change events, for tracking schedule adherence
2. **Journey**: Events denoting milestones in a conversation, for tracking the customer journey
3. **Queue State**: Updates on queues for tracking size and estimated wait times

In order to utilize these available real-time events, a customer will need to configure an API endpoint service under the customer's control. The balance of this document provides information about the high-level tasks a customer will need to accomplish in order to receive real-time events from ASAPP, as well as further information on the events available from ASAPP.

## Architecture Discussion

Upon a customer's request, ASAPP can provide several types of real-time event data.

<Note>
  Note that ASAPP can separately enhance standard real-time events to accommodate specific customer requirements. Such enhancements would usually be specified and implemented as part of ASAPP's regular product development process.
</Note>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-2d5ba1ef-2f1f-b9be-e56a-83915c699934.png" alt="Data-ERTAPI-Arch" />
</Frame>

The diagram above provides a high-level view of how a customer-maintained service that receives real-time ASAPP events might be designed; a service that runs on ASAPP-controlled infrastructure will push real-time event data to one or more HTTP endpoints maintained by the customer. For each individual event, the ASAPP service makes one POST request to the endpoint.

Event data will be transmitted using mTLS-based authentication (See the separate document [Securing Endpoints with Mutual TLS](/reporting/secure-data-retrieval#certificate-configuration) for details).

### Customer Requirements

* The customer must implement a POST API endpoint to handle the event messages.
* The customer and ASAPP must develop the mTLS authentication integration to secure the API endpoint
* All ASAPP real-time "raw" events will post to the same endpoint; the customer is expected to filter the received events to their needs based on name and event type.
* Each ASAPP real-time "processed" reporting feed can be configured to post to one arbitrary endpoint, at the customer's specified preference (i.e., each feed can post to a separate URI, or each can post to the same URI, or any combination required by the customer's use case.)

It should be noted that real-time events do not implement the de-duplication and grouping of ASAPP's batch reporting feeds; rather these real-time events provide building blocks for the customer to aggregate and build on. When making use of ASAPP's real-time events, the customer will be responsible for grouping, de-duplication, and aggregation of related events as required by the customer's particular use case. The events include metadata fields to facilitate such tasks.

### Endpoint Sizing

The endpoint configured by the customer should provisioned with sufficient scale to receive events at the rate generated by the customer's ASAPP implementation. As a rule of thumb, customers can expect:

* A voice call will generate on the order of 100 events per issue
* A text chat will generate on the order of 10 events per issue

So, for example, if the customer's application services 1000 issues per minute, that customer should expect their endpoint to receive 10,000 -- 100,000 messages per minute, or on the order of 1,000 messages per second.

### Endpoint Configuration

ASAPP can configure its service with the following parameters:

* **url:** The destination URL of the customer API endpoint that is set up to handle POST http requests.
* **timeout\_ms:** The number of milliseconds to wait for a HTTP 200 "OK" response before timing out.
* **retries:** The number of times to retry to send a message after a failed delivery.
* **(optional)event\_list:** List of `event_types` to send.

<Note>
  If `event_type` is empty it will default to send all events for this feed.
  List the necessary `event_type` to reduce unnecessary traffic.
</Note>

If the number of retries is exceeded and the customer's API is unable to handle any particular message, that message will be dropped. Real-time information lost in this way will typically be available in historical reporting feeds.

## Real-time Overview

ASAPP's standard real-time events include data representing human interactions and general issue lifecycle information from the ASAPP feeds named `com.asapp.event.activity`, `com.asapp.event.journey`, and `com.asapp.event.queue`.

In the future, when additional event sources are added, the event source will be reflected in the name of the stream.

## Payload Schema

Each of ASAPP's feeds will deliver a single event's data in a payload comprised of a two-level JSON object. The delivered payload includes:

1. Routing metadata at the top level common to all events.
   *A small set of fields that should always be present for all events, used for routing, filtering, and deduplication.*
2. Metadata common to all events.
   *These fields should usually be present for all events to provide meta-information on the event. Some fields may be omitted if they do not apply to the specific feed.*
3. Data specific to the event feed.
   *Some fields may be omitted but the same total set can be expected for each event of the same origin*
4. Details specific to the event type.

Null fields will be omitted -- the customer's API is expected to interpret missing keys as null.

**Versioning**

Minor-versions upgrades to the events are expected to be backwards-compatible; major-version updates typically include an interface-breaking change that may require the customer to update their API in order to take advantage of new features.

## Activity Feed

The agent activity feed provides a series of events for agent login and status changes. ASAPP processes the event data minimally before pushing it into the `activity` feed to:

* Convert internal flags to meaningful human-readable strings
* Filter the feed to include only data fields of potential interest to the customer

<Note>
  ASAPP's `activity` feed does not implement complex event processing (e.g., aggregation based on time windows, groups of events, de-duplication, or system state tracking). Any required aggregation or deduplication should be executed by the customer after receiving `activity` events.
</Note>

| name                    | Source of this event stream - use for filtering / routing                                                            |

| meta\_data.session\_id  | Customer-side identifier to link events together based on customer session. May be null for system-generated events. |
| meta\_data.client\_id   | May include client type, device, and version, if present in the event headers                                        |
| data.rep\_id            | Internal ASAPP identifier of an agent                                                                                |
| details                 | These fields vary based on the individual event type - only fields relevant to the event type will be present        |

<Note>
  Adding the `event_list` filter in the configuration allows the receiver of the real-time feed to indicate for which event types they want to receive an Activity message.

  This message will still contain all the fields that have been populated, as the events are being accumulated in the Activity message for that same `rep_id`.

  For example: If the `event_list` contains only `agent_activity_status_updated`, the Activity messages will still contain all the fields (`status_description`, `routing_status`, `previous_routing_status`, `assigned_customer_ct`, `utilization_5_min_active`, etc), but will only be sent whenever the agent status was updated.
</Note>

### Event Types

* `agent_activity_identity_updated`
* `agent_activity_status_updated`
* `agent_activity_capacity_updated`
* `agent_activity_assignment_load_updated`
* `agent_activity_routing_status_updated`
* `agent_activity_previous_routing_status`
* `agent_activity_queue_membership`
* `agent_activity_utilization_5_min`

## Journey Feed

The customer journey feed tracks important events in the customer's interaction with ASAPP. ASAPP processes the event data before pushing it into the `journey` feed to:

* Collect conversation and session events into a single feed of the customer journey
* Add metadata properties to the events to assist with contextualizing the events

<Note>
  This feature is available only for ASAPP Messaging.
</Note>

<Note>
  ASAPP's `journey` feed does not implement aggregation. Any aggregation or deduplication required by the customer's use case will need to be executed by the customer after receiving `journey` events.
</Note>

<Note>
  Adding the `event_list` filter in the configuration allows the receiver of the real-time feed to indicate for which event types they want to receive a Journey message.

  This message will still contain all the fields that have been populated, as the events are being accumulated in the Journey message for that same `issue_id`.

  Example: if the `event_list` contains only `SURVEY_SUBMITTED` the Journey messages will still contain all the fields (`issue_start_ts`, `assigned_ts`, `survey_responses`, etc), but will only be sent whenever the survey submitted event happens.
</Note>

## Queue State Feed

The queue state feed provides a set of events describing the state of a queue over the course of time. ASAPP processes the event data before pushing it into the `queue` feed to:

* Collect queue volume, queue time and queue hours events into a single feed of the queue state
* Add metadata properties to the events to assist with contextualizing the events

<Note>
  ASAPP's `queue` feed does not implement aggregation. Any aggregation or deduplication required by the customer's use case will need to be executed by the customer after receiving `queue` events.
</Note>

# Retrieving Data for ASAPP Messaging
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/reporting/retrieve-messaging-data

Learn how to retrieve data from ASAPP Messaging

ASAPP provides secure access to your messaging application data through SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).

The data exported will need to be [deduplicated](#removing-duplicate-data) before importing into your system.

<Note>
  If you're retrieving data from ASAPP's AI Services, use [File Exporter](/reporting/file-exporter) instead.
</Note>

## Download Data via SFTP

To download data from ASAPP via SFTP, you need to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a SSH key pair">
    You need to generate a SSH key pair and share the public key with ASAPP.

    <Accordion title="Generating a SSH key pair">
      If you don't have one already, you can generate one using the ssh-keygen command.

      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -b 4096
      ```

      This will walk you creating a key pair.
    </Accordion>

    Share your `<keyname>.pub` file with your ASAPP team.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to SFTP server">
    To connect to the SFTP server, you will need to use the following information:

    * Host: `prod-data-sftp.asapp.com`
    * Port: `22`
    * Username: `sftp{company name}`
      <Note>
        If you are unsure what your company name is, please reach out to your ASAPP account team.
      </Note>

    You should not use a password for SSH directly as you will be using the SSH key pair to authenticate.

    <Note>
      If you have a passphrase on your SSH key, you will need to enter it when prompted.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download data">
    Once connected, you can download or upload files. The folder structure and file names have a naming standard indicating the feed type and time of export, and other relevant information:

    ### Verifying the Data Export is Complete

    New Export files are continuously being generated depending on the feed and the export schedule. You can check the `_SUCCESS` file to verify that the export is complete.

    Upon completing the generating for a particular partition, ASAPP will create an EMPTY file named `_SUCCESS` to the same path as the export file or files. This `_SUCCESS` file acts as a flag indicating that the generation for the associated partition is complete. A `_SUCCESS` file will be written even if there is no available data selected for export for the partition at hand.

    Until the `_SUCCESS` file is created, ASAPP's export is in progress and you should not import the associated data file. You should check for this file before downloading any data partition.

    ### General Data Formatting Notes

    All ASAPP exports are formatted as follows:

    * Files are in [JSON Lines format](http://jsonlines.org/).
    * ASAPP export files are UTF-8 encoded.
    * Control characters are escaped.
    * Files are formatted with Unix-style line endings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Removing Duplicate Data

ASAPP continuously generates data, which means newer files may contain updated versions of previously exported records. To ensure you're working with the most up-to-date information, you need to remove duplicate data by keeping only the latest version of each record and discarding older duplicates.

To remove duplicates from the feeds, download the latest instance of a feed, and use the **Unique Conditions** as the "primary key" for that feed.

Each table's unique conditions are listed in the relevant [feed schema](/reporting/asapp-messaging-feeds).

### Example

In order to remove duplicates from the table [`convos_metrics`](/reporting/asapp-messaging-feeds#table-convos-metrics), use this query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
    (SELECT
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (partition by {{ primary_key }} order by {{ logical_timestamp}} DESC, {{ insertion_timestamp }} DESC) as row_idx
    FROM convos_metrics
    )
WHERE row_idx = 1
```

We partition by the `primary_key` for that table and get the latest data using order by `logical_timestamp`DESC in the subquery. Then we only select where `row_idx` = 1 to only pull the latest information we have for each `issue_id`.

### Schema Adjustments

We will occasionally extend the schema of an existing feed to add new columns. Your system should be able to handle these changes gracefully.

We will communicate any changes to the schema via your ASAPP account team.

You can also enable automated schema evolution detection and identify any changes using `export_docs.yaml`, which is generated each day and sent via the S3 feed. By incorporating this into the workflows, you can maintain a proactive stance, ensuring uninterrupted service and a smooth transition in the event of schema adjustments.

## Export Schema

We publish a [schema for each feed](/reporting/asapp-messaging-feeds). These schemas include the unique conditions for each table that you can use to remove duplicates from your data.

<Note>
  If you are retrieving data from Standalone Services, you need to use [File Exporter](/reporting/file-exporter).

# Secure Data Retrieval
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/reporting/secure-data-retrieval

Learn how to set up secure communication between ASAPP and your real-time event API.

# Secure Data Retrieval

Communication between ASAPP and a customer's real-time event API endpoint is secured using TLS, specifically Mutual-TLS (mTLS). This document provides details on the expected configuration of the mTLS-secured connection between ASAPP and the customer application.

## Overview

Mutual TLS requires that both server and client authenticate using digital certificates. The mTLS-secured integration with ASAPP relies on public certificate authorities (CAs). In this scenario, clients and servers host certificates issued by trusted public CAs (like Digicert, Symantec, etc.).

## Certificate Configuration

To further secure the connection, ASAPP requires the following additional configurations:

1. ASAPP's client certificate will contain a unique identifier in the "Subject" field. Customers can use this identifier to confirm that the presented certificate is from a legitimate ASAPP service. This identifier will be based on client identification conventions mutually agreed upon by ASAPP and the customer (e.g., UUIDs, namespaces).

2. Both server and client certificates will have validities of less than 3 years, in accordance with industry best practices.

3. Server certificates must have the "Extended Key Usage" field support "TLS Web Server Authentication" only. Client certificates must have the "Extended Key Usage" field support "TLS Web Client Authentication" only.

4. Minimum key sizes for client/server certificates should be:
   * 3072-bit for RSA
   * 256-bit for AES

## TLS/HTTPS Settings

REST endpoints must only support TLSv1.3 when setting up HTTPS connections. Older versions support weak ciphers that can be broken if a sufficient number of packets are captured.

### Supported Ciphers

Ensure that only the following ciphers (or equivalent) are supported by each endpoint:

* TLS\_ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384
* TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
* TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384
* TLS\_ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256
* TLS\_ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305
* TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256
* TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305

### Session Limits

TLS settings should limit each session to a short period. TLS libraries like OpenSSL set this to 300 seconds by default, which is sufficiently secure. A short session limits the usage of per-session AES keys, preventing potential brute-force analysis by attackers who capture session packets.

  Qualys provides a free tool called SSLTest ([https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)) to check for common issues in server TLS configuration. We recommend using this tool to test your public TLS endpoints before deploying to production.

# Transmitting Data via S3
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/reporting/send-s3



S3 is the supported mechanism for ongoing data transmissions, though can also be used for one-time transfers where needed. ASAPP customers can transmit the following types of data to S3:

* Call center data attributes
* Conversation transcripts from messaging or voice interactions
* Recorded call audio files
* Sales records with attribution metadata

## Getting Started

### Your Target S3 Buckets

ASAPP will provide you with a set of S3 buckets to which you may securely upload your data files, as well as a dedicated set of credentials authorized to write to those buckets. See the next section for more on those credentials.

For clarity, ASAPP name buckets use the following convention:

`s3://asapp-\{env\}-\{company_name\}-imports-\{aws-region\}`

<table class="informaltable frame-void rules-rows">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="th leftcol"><p>Key</p></th>
      <th class="th leftcol"><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="td leftcol"><p>env</p></td>
      <td class="td leftcol"><p>Environment (prod, pre\_prod, test)</p></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="td leftcol"><p>company\_name</p></td>

      <td class="td leftcol">
        <p>The company name: acme, duff, stark\_industries, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> company name should not have spaces within.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="td leftcol"><p>aws-region</p></td>

      <td class="td leftcol">
        <p>us-east-1</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> this is the current region supported for your ASAPP instance.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

So, for example, an S3 bucket set up to receive pre-production data from ACME would be named:

`s3://asapp-pre_prod-acme-imports-us-east-1`

#### S3 Target for Historical Transcripts

ASAPP has a distinct target location for sending historical transcripts for AI Services and will provide an exclusive access folder to which transcripts should be uploaded. The S3 bucket location follows this naming convention:

`asapp-customers-sftp-\{env\}-\{aws-region\}`

Values for `env` and `aws-region` are set in the same way as above. As an example, an S3 bucket to receive transcripts for use in production is named:

`asapp-customers-sftp-prod-us-east-1`

<Note>
  See the [Historical Transcript File Structure](/reporting/send-s3#historical-transcript-file-structure "Historical Transcript File Structure") section more information on how to format transcript files for transmission.
</Note>

### Encryption

ASAPP ensures that the data you write to your dedicated S3 buckets is encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL and encrypted at rest using AES256.

### Your Dedicated Export AWS Credentials

ASAPP will provide you with a set of AWS credentials that allow you to securely upload data to your designated S3 buckets. (Since you need write access in order to upload data to S3, you'll need to use a different set of credentials than the read-only credentials you might already have.)

In order for ASAPP to securely send credentials to you, you must provide ASAPP with a public GPG key that we can use to encrypt a file containing those credentials.

<Note>
  GitHub provides one of many good available  tutorials on GPG key generation here: [https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key) .
</Note>

It's safe to send your public GPG key to ASAPP using any available channel. Please do NOT provide ASAPP with your private key.

Once you've provided ASAPP with your public GPG key, we'll forward to you an expiring https link pointing to an S3-hosted file containing credentials that have permissions to write to your dedicated S3 target buckets.

<Caution>
  ASAPP's standard practice is to have these links expire after 24 hours.
</Caution>

The file itself will be encrypted using your public GPG key. Once you decrypt the provided file using your private GPG key, your credentials will be contained within a tab delimited file with the following structure:

`id     secret      bucket     sub-folder (if any)`

## Data File Formatting and Preparation

**General Requirements:**

* Files should be UTF-8 encoded.
* Control characters should be escaped.
* You may provide files as CSV or JSONL format, but we strongly recommend JSONL where possible. (CSV files are just too fragile.)
* If you send a CSV file, ASAPP recommends that you include a header. Otherwise, your CSV must provide columns in the exact order listed below.
* When providing a CSV file, you must provide an explicit null value (as the unquoted string: `NULL` ) for missing or empty values.

### Historical Transcript File Structure

ASAPP accepts uploads for historical conversation transcripts for both voice calls and chats.

The fields described below must be the columns in your uploaded .CSV table.

Each row in the uploaded .CSV table should correspond to one sent message.

| FIELD NAME                   | REQUIRED? | FORMAT    | EXAMPLE                          | NOTES                                             |
| :--------------------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **conversation\_externalId** | Yes       | String    | 3245556677                       | Unique identifier for the conversation            |
| **sender\_externalId**       | Yes       | String    | 6433421                          | Unique identifier for the sender of the message   |
| **sender\_role**             | Yes       | String    | agent                            | Supported values are 'agent', 'customer' or 'bot' |
| **text**                     | Yes       | String    | Happy to help, one moment please | Message from sender                               |
| **timestamp**                | Yes       | Timestamp | 2022-03-16T18:42:24.488424Z      | ISO 8601 formatted UTC timestamp                  |

<Note>
  Proper transcript formatting and sampling ensures data is usable for model training. Please ensure transcripts conform to the following:

  **Formatting**

  * Each utterance is clearly demarcated and sent by one identified sender
  * Utterances are in chronological order and complete, from beginning to very end of the conversation
  * Where possible, transcripts include the full content of the conversation rather than an abbreviated version. For example, in a digital messaging conversation:

  <table class="informaltable frame-void rules-rows">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="th"><p>Full</p></th>
        <th class="th"><p>Abbreviated</p></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="td">
          <p><strong>Agent</strong>: Choose an option from the list below</p>
          <p><strong>Agent</strong>: (A) 1-way ticket (B) 2-way ticket (C) None of the above</p>
          <p><strong>Customer</strong>: (A) 1-way ticket</p>
        </td>

        <td class="td">
          <p><strong>Agent</strong>: Choose an option from the list below</p>
          <p><strong>Customer</strong>: (A)</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  **Sampling**

  * Transcripts are from a wide range of dates to avoid seasonality effects; random sampling over a 12-month period is recommended
  * Transcripts mimic the production conversations on which models will be used - same types of participants, same channel (voice, messaging), same business unit
  * There are no duplicate transcripts
</Note>

**Transmitting Transcripts to S3**

Historical transcripts are sent to a distinct S3 target separate from other data imports.

<Note>
  Please refer to the [S3 Target for Historical Transcripts](/reporting/send-s3#your-target-s3-buckets "Your Target S3 Buckets") section for details.

## Uploading Data to S3

At a high level, uploading your data is a three step process:

1. Build and format your files for upload, as detailed above.
2. Construct a "target path" for those files following the convention in the section "Constructing your Target Path" below.
3. Signal the completion of your upload by writing an empty \_SUCCESS file to your "target path", as described in the section "Signaling that your upload is complete" below.

### Constructing your target path

ASAPP's automation will use the S3 filename of your upload when deciding how to process your data file, where the filename is formatted as follows:

`s3://BUCKET_NAME/FEED_NAME/version=VERSION_NUMBER/format=FORMAT_NAME/dt=DATE/hr=HOUR/mi=MINUTE/DATAFILE_NAME(S)`

The following table details the convention that ASAPP follows when handling uploads:

### Signaling that Your Upload Is Complete

Upon completing a data upload, you must upload an EMPTY file named \_SUCCESS to the same path as your uploaded file, as a flag that indicates your data upload is complete. Until this file is uploaded, ASAPP will assume that the upload is in progress and will not import the associated data file.

As an example, let's say you're uploading one day of call center data in a set of files.

### Incremental and Snapshot Modes

You may provide data to ASAPP as either Incremental or Snapshot data. The value you provide us in the `format` field discussed above, tells ASAPP whether to treat the data you provide as Incremental or Snapshot data.

When importing data using **Incremental** mode, ASAPP will **append** the given data to the existing data imported for that `FEED_NAME`. When you specify **Incremental** mode, you are telling ASAPP that for a given date, the data which was uploaded is for that day only.  If you use the value `dt=2018-09-02` in your constricted filename, you are indicating that the data contained in that file includes records from `2018-09-02 00:00:00 UTC` → `2018-09-02 23:59:59 UTC`.

When importing data using **Snapshot** mode, ASAPP will **replace** any existing data for the indicated `FEED_NAME` with the contents of the uploaded file. When you specify **Snapshot** mode, ASAPP treats the uploaded data as a complete record from "the time history started" until that particular day end.  A date of `2018-09-02` means the data includes, effectively, all things from `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC` → `2018-09-02 23:59:59 UTC`.

### Other Upload Notes and Tips

1. Make sure the structure for the imported file (whether columnar or json formatted) matches the current import standards (see below for details)
2. Data imports are scheduled daily, 4 hours after UTC midnight (for the previous day's data)
3. In the event that you upload historical data (i.e., from older dates than are currently in the system), please inform your ASAPP team so a complete re-import can be scheduled.
4. Snapshot data must go into a format=snapshot\_\{type} folder.
5. Providing a Snapshot allows you to provide all historical data at once.  In effect, this reloads the entire table rather than appending data as in the non-snapshot case.

### Upload Example

The example below assumes a shell terminal with python 2.7+ installed.

```json
# install aws cli (assumes python)
pip install awscli
# configure your S3 credentials if not already done
aws configure
# push the files for 2019-01-20 for the call_center_issues import
# for a company named `umbrella-corp` to your local drive in production
aws s3 cp /location/of/your/file.csv s3://asapp-prod-umbrella-corp-imports-us-east-1/call_center_issues/version=1/format=csv/dt=2019-01-20/
aws s3 cp _SUCCESS s3://asapp-prod-umbrella-corp-imports-us-east-1/call_center_issues/version=1/format=csv/dt=2019-01-20/
# you should see some files now in the s3 location
aws s3 ls s3://asapp-prod-umbrella-corp-imports-us-east-1/call_center_issues/version=1/format=csv/dt=2019-01-20/
    file.csv
    _SUCCESS
```


# Transmitting Data to SFTP
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/reporting/send-sftp



SFTP is the supported mechanism for **one-time data transmissions**, typically used for sending training data files during the implementation phase prior to initial launch. ASAPP customers can transmit the following types of training data via SFTP:

* Conversation transcripts from messaging or voice interactions
* Recorded call audio files
* Free-text agent notes associated with messaging or voice interactions

## Getting Started

ASAPP will require you to provide the following information to set up the SFTP site.

* An SSH public key.  This should use RSA encryption with a key length of 4096 bits.

ASAPP will provide you a username to associate with the key. This will be of the form: `sftp<company marker>` where the company marker will be selected by ASAPP.  For example a username could be: `sftptestcompany`

In your network, open port 22 outbound to sftp.us-east-1.asapp.com.

## Data File Formatting and Preparation

**General Requirements:**

* Files should be UTF-8 encoded.
* Control characters should be escaped.
* You may provide files as CSV or JSONL format, but we strongly recommend JSONL where possible. (CSV files are just too fragile.)
* If you send a CSV file, ASAPP recommends that you include a header. Otherwise, your CSV must provide columns in the exact order listed below.
* When providing a CSV file, you must provide an explicit null value (as the unquoted string: `NULL` ) for missing or empty values.

### Historical Transcript File Structure

ASAPP accepts uploads for historical conversation transcripts for both voice calls and chats.

The fields described below must be the columns in your uploaded .CSV table.

Each row in the uploaded .CSV table should correspond to one sent message.

<Note>
  Proper transcript formatting and sampling ensures data is usable for model training. Please ensure transcripts conform to the following:

  **Formatting**

  * Each utterance is clearly demarcated and sent by one identified sender
  * Utterances are in chronological order and complete, from beginning to very end of the conversation
  * Where possible, transcripts include the full content of the conversation rather than an abbreviated version. For example, in a digital messaging conversation:

    <table class="informaltable frame-void rules-rows">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th class="th"><p>Full</p></th>
          <th class="th"><p>Abbreviated</p></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="td">
            <p><strong>Agent</strong>: Choose an option from the list below</p>
            <p><strong>Agent</strong>: (A) 1-way ticket (B) 2-way ticket (C) None of the above</p>
            <p><strong>Customer</strong>: (A) 1-way ticket</p>
          </td>

          <td class="td">
            <p><strong>Agent</strong>: Choose an option from the list below</p>
            <p><strong>Customer</strong>: (A)</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  **Sampling**

  * Transcripts are from a wide range of dates to avoid seasonality effects; random sampling over a 12-month period is recommended
  * Transcripts mimic the production conversations on which models will be used - same types of participants, same channel (voice, messaging), same business unit
  * There are no duplicate transcripts

## Generate SSH Public Key Pair and Upload Files

You can generate the key and upload files via Windows, Mac, or Linux.

### Windows Users

If you are using Windows, follow the steps below:

#### 1. Generate an SSH Key Pair

There are multiple tools that you can use to generate an SSH Key Pair. For example: by using puTTYgen (available from [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) ) as shown below.

Choose RSA and 4096 bits, then click **generate** and move the mouse pointer randomly.  When the key is generated, enter `sftp` followed by your company marker as the key comment.

</Frame>

#### 2. Provide the Public Key to ASAPP

Save the public and private key.  Only send the public file for your key pair to ASAPP.  This is not a secret and can be emailed.

#### 3. Upload Files

Use an SFTP utility such as Cyberduck (available from [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) ) to upload files to ASAPP.  Click **Open Connection**, add sftp.us-east-1.asapp.com as the Server,  and add `sftpcompanymarker` as the Username.  Choose the private key you generated in step 2 as the SSH Private Key and click **connect**.  The following screenshots show how to do this using Cyberduck.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-46081ee0-cb13-663d-a3b2-10c7a0b76d40.PNG" />
</Frame>

A pop-up window appears. Click to allow the unknown fingerprint.  You will then see the `in` and `out` directories.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-72764c0e-5e59-0831-3148-a5b5fa016b8f.PNG" />
</Frame>

Double click the `in` directory and click **Upload** to choose files to send to ASAPP.

### Mac/Linux Users

If you are using a Mac or Linux, follow the steps below:

#### 1. Generate an SSH Key Pair

If you are using a Mac or Linux, you can generate a key pair from the terminal as follows.

If you already have an `id_rsa` file in the `.ssh` directory that you use with other applications, you should specify a different filename for the key so you do not overwrite it.  You can either do that with the `-f` option or type in a `filename` when prompted.

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C sftp<companymarker>; -f filename`

For Example:

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C sftptestcompany -f keyforasapp`

Where the filename will be the name of two files generated - `filename` (the private key you must keep to yourself) and `filename.pub` (the public key which ASAPP needs)

If you do not have an `id_rsa` file in the `.ssh` directory, you can go with the default filename of  `id_rsa` and do not need to use the `-f` option.

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C sftp<companymarker>`

#### 2. Provide the Public Key to ASAPP

Send the `.pub` file for your key pair to ASAPP.  This is not a secret and can be emailed.

#### 3. Upload Files

You can upload files using the terminal or you can use [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/). This section describes how to upload files using the terminal.

To login to the ASAPP server, type one of the following:

If you used the default id\_rsa key name:

`sftp sftp<companymarker>@sftp.us-east-1.asapp.com`

If you specified a different filename for the key:

`sftp -oIdentityFile=filename`

`sftp sftp<companymarker>@sftp.us-east-1.asapp.com`

For Example:

`sftp -oIdentityFile=keyforasapp`

`sftptestcompany@sftp.us-east-1.asapp.com`

You will see the command line prompt change to `sftp>`

If the `sftp` command fails, adding the `-v` parameter will provide logging information to help to diagnose the problem.

Use terminal commands such as `ls, cd, mkdir` on the remote server.

* `ls:` list files
* `cd:` change directory
* `mkdir`: make a new directory
  `ls` will show two directories: `in` (for sending files to ASAPP) and `out` (for receiving files from ASAPP).

To create a transcripts directory on the remote machine to send transcripts to ASAPP, type:

```json
cd in
mkdir transcripts
cd transcripts
```

To navigate on the local machine, prefix terminal commands with l

* `lcd`: change the local directory
* `lls`: list local files
* `lpwd`: to see the local working directory

Use `get` (retrieve) and `put` (upload) to transfer files.

`get` will fetch files from the remote server to the current directory on the local machine.

For example:

`get output.csv` will transfer a file named output.csv from the remote server.

`put` will transfer files to the remote server from the current directory on the local machine.

Navigate to local directory with transcripts and type:

`put transcripts.csv` will transfer a file named transcripts.csv to the remote server.

or

`put *` will transfer all files in the local directory.

or

`put -r <local directory>` works recursively and will transfer all files in the local directory, all sub directories, and all files within them to the remote machine. 

For example:

`put -r sftptest`

will transfer the sftptest directory and everything within it and below it from the local machine to the remote machine.

To end the SFTP session, type `quit` or `exit`.


# Transmitting Data to ASAPP
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/reporting/transmitting-data-to-asapp

Learn how to transmit data to ASAPP for Applications and AI Services.

Customers can securely upload data for ASAPP's consumption for Applications and AI Services using three distinct mechanisms. Read more on how to transmit data by clicking on the link that best matches your use case.

* [**Upload to S3**](/reporting/send-s3 "Transmitting Data to S3")

  S3 is the supported mechanism for ongoing data transmissions, though can also be used for one-time transfers where needed. ASAPP customers can transmit the following types of data to S3:

  * Call center data attributes
  * Conversation transcripts from messaging or voice interactions
  * Recorded call audio files
  * Sales records with attribution metadata
* **[Upload to SFTP](/reporting/send-sftp "Transmitting Data to SFTP")**

  SFTP is the supported mechanism for **one-time data transmissions**, typically used for sending training data files during the implementation phase prior to initial launch. ASAPP customers can transmit the following types of training data via SFTP:

  * Conversation transcripts from messaging or voice interactions
  * Recorded call audio files
  * Free-text agent notes associated with messaging or voice interactions

  Reach out to your ASAPP account contact to coordinate sending data via SFTP.

# Data Redaction
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/security/data-redaction

Learn how Data Redaction removes sensitive data from your conversations.

Live conversations are completely uninhibited and as such, customers may mistakenly communicate sensitive information (e.g. credit card number, SSN, etc.) in a manner that increases risk.

In order to mitigate this risk, ASAPP performs redaction logic that can be customized for your business's needs. You also have the ability to add your own [custom redaction rules](#custom-regex-redaction-rules) using regular expressions.

Reach out to your ASAPP account team to learn more.

## Custom Regex Redaction Rules

In AI-Console, you can view existing custom, regex based redaction rules and add new ones for your organization.

Adding rules match specific patterns by using regular expressions. These new rules can be deployed to testing environments and to production.

Custom redaction rules live in the Core Resources section of AI-Console.

* Custom redaction rules are displayed as an ordered list of rules with names.
* Each individual rule will display the underlying regex.

To add a custom rule:

1. Click **Add new**
2. Create a unique Regex Name
3. Add the regex for the particular rule
4. Test your regex rule to ensure it works as expected
5. Add the regex to sandbox

Once a rule has been added to the sandbox environment, test it in your lower environment to ensure it's behaving as expected.


# External IP Blocking
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/security/external-ip-blocking

Use External IP Blocking to block IP addresses from accessing your data.

ASAPP has tools in place to monitor and automatically block activity based on malicious behavior and bad reputation sources (IPs). This blocking inhibits traffic from IPs that could damage, disable, overburden, disrupt or impair any ASAPP servers or APIs.

By default, ASAPP does not block IPs of end users who exhibit abusive behaviors towards agents. IP blocking is trivial to evade and often causes unintended collateral damage to normal users since IP address are dynamic.

It can happen that a previously blocked IP address become the IP address for a valid user, preventing the valid user from using ASAPP and your product.

While we do not recommend IP blocking, you are still able to block users by IP address to help address urgent protection needs.

## Blocking IP Addresses on AI Console

AI-Console provides the ability for administrators with the correct permissions to block external IP addresses that may present a threat to your organization.

To block an IP Address in AI Console:

1. Manually enter (or copy) an individual IP address in the Denylist
2. Click Save and Deploy to save the changes to production

You are able to access IP Addresses in Conversation Manager, giving you insight into the IP address associated with potentially malicious users.

IP Addresses can be unblocked by clicking the trash icon on the blocked IP's row, and then saving and deploying the updated list.

<Note>
  Blocked users receive an error message and the Chat bubble will not appear at the end of their screen.

  From the API perspective,  *shouldDisplayWebChat* will return a **503 Forbidden** error
</Note>

## Additional Contextual Information

Dynamic's ISP IP rotates quite often. This means that the 1-1 relationship between a public IP and an individual/device/client is merely temporary and the assignment will continually change in the future as described below.

**ISP Assignation within the Time**

IP(1) --- UserA

IP(2) --- UserB

IP(3) --- UserC

.......................

IP(1) --- UserC

IP(2) --- UserB

IP(3) --- UserA

If ASAPP prevents UserA from reaching our platform by blocking IP(1), there is a risk that ISPs assign IP(1) to UserB or UserC at some point in the future.

There are also many scenarios where legitimate users share a single IP with abusive users, such as public WiFi networks:

* Company named networks
* College or corporate campuses that route many users from a single outbound IP
* Personal and corporate VPN devices that aggregate many uses to a single IP

Blocking those IP's will prevent many other legitimate users from access to the ASAPP platform.


# Warning about CustomerInfo and Sensitive Data
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/security/warning-about-customerinfo-and-sensitive-data

Learn how to securely handle Customer Information.

<Warning>
  Do not send sensitive data via `CustomerInfo`, `custom_params`, or `customer_params`.
</Warning>

ASAPP implements strict controls to ensure the confidentiality and security of ALL data  we handle on behalf of our customers. For **sensitive data**, ASAPP employs an even more stringent level of control. ("Sensitive data" includes such categories as Personal Health Information, Personally Identifiable Information, and financial/PCI data.)

In general, ASAPP recommends that customers ONLY send sensitive data in specified fields, and where ASAPP expects to receive such data.

ASAPP treats all customer data securely. By default, however, ASAPP may not apply the strictest levels of controls that we maintain for **sensitive data** for content submitted via `CustomerInfo`, `custom_params`, or `customer_params`.

## What is CustomerInfo?

Certain calls available via ASAPP APIs and SDKs provide a parameter that supports the inclusion of arbitrary data with the call.

We'll refer to such fields as **"CustomerInfo"** here, even though in different ASAPP interfaces they may be variously called "custom\_params", "customer\_params", and "CustomerInfo".

CustomerInfo is typically a JSON object containing a set of key:value pairs that can be used in multiple ways by ASAPP and ASAPP customers. For example, as context input for use in the ASAPP Web SDK:

```javascript
"CustomerInfo": {
    "Inflight": true,
    "TierLevel": "Gold"
}
```

## Do not send sensitive data as cleartext via CustomerInfo

ASAPP strongly recommends that our customers do NOT send sensitive data using CustomerInfo.

If customer requirements dictate that sensitive data must be sent via CustomerInfo, CUSTOMERS MUST ENCRYPT SENSITIVE DATA BEFORE SENDING. The customer should encrypt any sensitive data before sending via CustomerInfo, using a private encryption mechanism (i.e. a mechanism not known to ASAPP).

This practice will ensure that ASAPP never has access to the customer's sensitive data, so that data will remain securely protected while in transit through ASAPP systems.

Additionally, ASAPP strongly recommends that our customers use strong encryption. Specifically, we insist that customers use one of the following configurations:

* **Symmetric Encryption Model:** use AES-GCM-256 (authenticated encryption) with a random [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_\(cryptography\)) to provide data integrity, confidentiality and enhanced security. Each combination of salt+associated data should be unique.
* **Asymmetric Encryption Model:** use a key size of 2048, and use RSA as an algorithm. ASAPP recommends setting a key expiration date of less than two years. ASAPP and the customer should both have mechanisms in place to update the key being used. Private keys which are rotated should be retained temporarily for the purposes of accessing previously encrypted data.

In extraordinary circumstances, ASAPP can make exceptions to these requirements. Please contact your ASAPP account team to discuss options if you have a compelling business need to have ASAPP implement an exception.

# Reporting Issues to ASAPP
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/support/reporting-issues-to-asapp



## Incident Management

### Overview

The goals of incident management at ASAPP are:

* To minimize the negative impact of service incidents on our customers. 
* To restore our customers' ASAPP implementation to normal operation as quickly as possible.
* To take the necessary steps in order to prevent similar incidents in the future.
* To successfully integrate with our customers' standard incident management policies.

### Severity Level Classification

| Severity Level | Description                                                                                                                                           | Report To                                    |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| 1              | ASAPP is unusable or inoperable; a major function is unavailable with no acceptable bypass/workaround; a security or confidentiality breach occurred. | Service Desk interface via support.asapp.com |
| 2              | A major function is unavailable but an acceptable bypass/workaround is available.                                                                     | Service Desk interface via support.asapp.com |
| 3              | A minor function is disabled by a defect; a function is not working correctly; the defect is not time-critical and has minimal user impact.           | Service Desk interface via support.asapp.com |
| 4              | The issue is not critical to the day-to-day operations of any single user; and there is an acceptable alternative solution.                           | Service Desk interface via support.asapp.com |

### Standard Response and Resolution Times

This table displays ASAPP's standard response and resolution times based on issue severity as outlined in the Service Level Agreement.

| Severity Level | Initial Response Time | Issue Resolution Time |
| :------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| 1              | 15 minutes            | 2 hours               |
| 2              | 15 minutes            | 4 hours               |
| 3              | 24 hours              | 15 business days      |
| 4              | 1 business day        | 30 business days      |

### Severity Level 1 Incidents

**Examples:**

* Customer chat is inaccessible.
* \>5% of agents are unable to access Agent Desk.
* \>5% of agents are experiencing chat latency (>5 seconds to send or receive a chat message)

**Overview:**

* Severity Level 1 Incidents can require a significant amount of ASAPP resources beyond normal operating procedures, and outside of normal operating hours.
* Escalating via Service Desk initiates an escalation policy that is more effective than reaching out directly to any individual ASAPP contact.
* You will receive an acknowledgment from ASAPP within 15 minutes.

### Severity Level 2 & 3 Incidents

**Severity Level 2 Examples:**

* Conversation list screen within the Admin dashboard is blanking out for supervisors, but Agents are still able to maintain chats.
* User Management screen within Admin is unavailable.

**Severity Level 3 Examples:**

* Historical Reporting data has not been refreshed in 90+ minutes.
* A limited number of chats appear to be routing incorrectly.
* A single agent is unable to access Agent Desk.

### Issue Ticketing and Prioritization

* ASAPP maintains all client reported issues in its own ticketing system.
* ASAPP triages and slates issues for sprints based on severity level and number of users impacted.
* ASAPP's engineering teams work in 2 week sprints, meaning that reported issues are typically resolved within 1-2 sprints.
* ASAPP will consider Severity Level 1 and 2 issues for a hotfix (i.e. breaking the ASAPP sprint and release process, and being released directly to PreProd / Prod).

### Issue Reporting Process

* **For Severity 1 Issues:**
  In the event of a Severity 1 failure of a business function in the ASAPP environment, report issues via the Service Desk interface at [support.asapp.com](http://support.asapp.com) by filling out all required fields.
  By selecting the Severity value as **Critical**, you will automatically mobilize ASAPP's on-call team, who will assess the incident and start working on a solution if applicable.
* **For Severity 2-4 Issues:**
  In the event of any non-critical issues with a business function in the ASAPP environment, report issues via the Service Desk interface at [support.asapp.com](http://support.asapp.com) by filling out all required fields.
  ASAPP will escalate the reported issue to the relevant members of the ASAPP team, and you will receive updates via the ticket comments.

The ASAPP team will follow the workflow outlined below for each Service Desk ticket. Each box corresponds to the Service Desk ticket status.

# Service Desk Information
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/support/service-desk-information



**What is the ASAPP Service Desk?**

Service Desk is the tool ASAPP uses for the ingestion and tracking of all issues and modifications in our customers' demo and production environments. All issue reports and configuration requests between ASAPP and our customers are handled via the tool.

**How can I access the Service Desk?**

The Service Desk can be accessed at [support.asapp.com](http://support.asapp.com).

Service Desk access is provisioned by your ASAPP account team after the initial Service Desk training is completed. All subsequent access requests and/or modifications should be handled via email with your ASAPP account team.

**When do I create a ticket?**

A Service Desk ticket should be created any time an issue is identified with an ASAPP product (this includes Admin, Desk, Chat SDK, and AI Services) in either the demo or production environment. Additionally, a ticket should be created in cases where an existing configuration needs to be updated.

**How do I create a ticket?**

A Service Desk ticket can be created by navigating to support.asapp.com, logging in, clicking **Submit a Request** in the top right corner of the screen, and filling out and submitting the ticket form.

**What happens after I've created a ticket?**

Once the ticket form is submitted, ASAPP will receive an automatic notification. The ASAPP Technical Services team will acknowledge and review the ticket, triage internally, and request additional information if needed. All correspondence, including requests for additional information, explanations of existing functionality, and updates on fix timelines will take place in the ticket comments.

**Should I use Service Desk to ask questions?**

In general, reaching out to your ASAPP account contact(s) directly is the best way to answer a question or begin a discussion. Your ASAPP account contacts can help you determine whether observed behavior is expected or an unexpected issue.

If an issue is confirmed unexpected or a configuration available, create a ticket in Service Desk to begin addressing it.

**What if I have an urgent production problem?**

ASAPP calls urgent production issues **Severity 1** and defines them as follows:

<Note>
  "ASAPP is unusable or inoperable; a major function is unavailable with no acceptable bypass/workaround; a security or confidentiality breach occurred"

  An issue that meets this criteria should be reported as a ticket in Service Desk with the Priority level **Urgent**.

  See [Severity Level Classification](/support/reporting-issues-to-asapp#severity-level-classification "Severity Level Classification") for descriptions, illustrative examples and associated reporting processes.
</Note>


# Troubleshooting Guide
Source: https://docs.asapp.com/support/troubleshooting-guide



This document outlines some preliminary checks to determine the health and status of the connection between the customer or agent's browser and an ASAPP backend host prior to escalating to the ASAPP Support Team.

<Note>
  You must have access to Chrome Developer Tools in order to use this guide.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting from a Web Browser

### Using Chrome Developer Tools

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with Chrome Developer Tools, if you are not already. ASAPP will base the troubleshooting efforts for front-end Web SDK use around the Chrome Web Browser.

[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open)

ASAPP will also inspect network traffic as the Web SDK makes API calls to the ASAPP backend. Please also review the documentation on Chrome Developer Tools regarding networking.

[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network)

### API Call HTTP Return Status Codes

In general, you can check connectivity and environment status by looking at the HTTP return codes from the API calls the ASAPP Web SDK makes to the ASAPP backend. You can accomplish this by limiting calls to ASAPP traffic in the Network tab. This will narrow the results to traffic that is using the string "ASAPP" somewhere in the call.

First and foremost, look for traffic that does not return successful 200 HTTP status codes. If there are 400 and 500 level errors, there may be potential network connectivity or configuration issues between the user and ASAPP backend.

Please review HTTP status codes at: [https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes).

To view HTTP return codes:

1. Open **Dev Tools** and navigate to the **Network** tab.
2. Reload the page or navigate to a page with ASAPP chat enabled.
3. Filter network traffic to **ASAPP**.
4. Look at the "Status" for each call. Failed calls are highlighted in red.
5. For non-200 status codes, denote what the call is by the "Request URL" and the return status. You can find other helpful information in context in the "Request Payload".

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-e6fe6329-8256-648b-95a2-1cf6f4d5d9d2.png" />
</Frame>

### Environment Targeting

To determine the ASAPP environment targeted by the front-end, you can look at the network traffic and note what hostname is referenced. For instance, ...something-demo01.test.asapp.com is the demo environment for that implementation. You will see this on every call to the ASAPP backend and it may be helpful to filter the network traffic to "ASAPP".

1. Open **Dev Tools** and navigate to the **Network** tab.
2. Reload the page or navigate to a page with ASAPP chat enabled.
3. Filter network traffic to **ASAPP**.
4. Look at the "Request URL" for the network call.
5. Parse the hostname from `https://something-demo01.test.asapp.com/api/noauth/ShouldDisplayWebChat?ASAPP-ClientType=web-sdk&amp;amp;ASAPP-ClientVersion=4.0.1-uat\`: something-demo01.test.asapp.com

</Frame>

### WebSocket Status

In addition to looking at the API calls, it is important to look at the WebSocket connections in use. You should also be able to inspect the frames within the WebSocket to ensure messages are received properly.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-9e750335-dd43-9b01-7c8c-abbe0d089f5a.png" />
</Frame>

[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference#frames](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference#frames)

## Troubleshooting Customer Chat

### Should Display Web Chat

If chat does not display on the desired web page, the first place to check is ASAPP's call for `ShouldDisplayWebChat` via the **Chrome Developer Tool Network** tab. A successful API call response should contain a `DisplayCustomerSupport` field with a value of `true`. If this value is `false` for a page that should display chat, please reach out to the ASAPP Support Team. Superusers can access the Triggers section of ASAPP Admin. This will enable them to determine if the URL visited is set to display chat.

To troubleshoot:

1. Open **Dev Tools** and navigate to the **Network** tab.
2. Reload the page or navigate to a page with ASAPP chat enabled.
3. Filter network traffic to **ASAPP**.
4. Look at the "Request Payload" for `ShouldDisplayWebChat` and look for a `true` response for `DisplayCustomerSupport`.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-3be4e43e-1912-916e-fb30-22a05fd9787c.png" />
</Frame>

### Web SDK Context Input

To view the context provided to the SDK, you can look at the request payload of most SDK API calls. Context input may vary but typical items include:

* Subdivisions
* Segments
* Customer info parameters
* External session IDs

<Card title="Web SDK Context Provider" href="/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider"> Review the ASAPP SDK Web Context Provider page</Card>

To view the context:

1. Open **Dev Tools** and navigate to the **Network** tab.
2. Reload page or navigate to a page with ASAPP chat enabled.
3. Filter network traffic to **ASAPP**.
4. Look at the "Request Payload" for `GetOfferedMessageUnauthed` and open the tree as follows:

**Params -> Params -> Context** -> All Customer Context (including Auth Token)

**Params -> Params -> AuthenticationParams** -> Customer ID

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-7d923376-1aeb-0ef0-67e8-1dc3c9c68cf5.png" />
</Frame>

### Customer Authentication Input

For authenticated customer chat sessions, you can see the Auth key within the context parameters used throughout the API calls to ASAPP.

The values passed into the Auth context will depend on the integration.

<Card title="Web SDK Context Provider" href="/messaging-platform/integrations/web-sdk/web-contextprovider"> Review the ASAPP SDK Web Context Provider page for the complete use of this key</Card>

## Troubleshooting Agent Chat from Agent Desk

### Connection Status Banners

There are 3 connection statuses:

* Disconnected (Red)
* Reconnecting (Yellow)
* Connected (Green)

You will see a banner on the bottom of the ASAPP Agent Desk with the correlating colors: Red, Yellow, Green. The red and green banners only appear briefly while the connection state changes. However, the yellow banner will remain until a connection is reestablished. The connection state relies on 2 main inputs:

* 204 API calls
* WebSocket echo timeouts

After a timeout grace period of 5 seconds for either of these timeouts, a red or yellow banner will appear.

**Yellow Reconnecting Banner**

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-8d26b34e-5abe-0664-dc13-f116fcfaa244.png" />
</Frame>

### 204 API call

The ASAPP Agent Desk makes API calls to the backend periodically to ensure status and connectivity reporting is functional. Verify the HTTP status and response timing of these calls to look for indicators of an issue. These calls display as the number 204 in the Chrome Developer Tools Network tab.

To view these calls:

1. Open **Dev Tools** and navigate to the **Network** tab.
2. Reload page or navigate to a page with ASAPP chat enabled.
3. Filter network traffic to **ASAPP**.
4. Look at the "204" calls over time to determine good health.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-ca52a4b7-4d0c-e773-323c-195a2e9970c2.png" />
</Frame>

### WebSocket

When a customer chat loads onto the ASAPP Agent Desk, this creates a WebSocket. During the life of that conversation, ASAPP sends continual echoes (requests and responses) to determine WebSocket health and status. ASAPP sends the echoes every 16-18 seconds and has a 6 second timeout by default. If these requests and responses intermittently time out, there is likely a network issue between the Agent Desktop and the ASAPP Desk application.

You can also view messages being sent through WebSocket, as the agent to customer conversation happens:

1. Open **Dev Tools** and navigate to the **Network** tab.
2. Reload page or navigate to a page with ASAPP chat enabled.
3. Click **WS** next to the Filter text box to filter network traffic to WebSocket.
4. Look at the Messages tab in WebSocket.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-9c235a8b-d895-a7de-f904-aee054c0d4f3.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-d9fae80a-dfdb-5446-4bb6-140287c89601.png" />
</Frame>

If you see one of these pairs of echoes missing, it is most likely because Agent Desk did not receive the echo from the ASAPP backend due to packet loss. If the 'Attempting to reconnect..' message shows, Agent Desk attempts to reconnect with the ASAPP backend to establish a new WebSocket. The messages display in red text starting with 'request?ASAPP-ClientType' in the Network tab of Chrome Developer Tools.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-0e90bcea-cc88-8f78-fd2f-99cbcea61c19.png" />
</Frame>

If you loose network connectivity and then re-establish it, there will be multiple WebSocket entries visible when you click on **WS**.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-7840633a-5eaf-b4ce-a6b5-70f04a5ae40e.png" />
</Frame>

## Troubleshooting Agent Desk/Admin Access Issues

### Using Employee List in ASAPP Admin

If a user has issues logging in to ASAPP, you can view their details within ASAPP Admin after their first successful login. Check the Enabled status, Roles, and Groups for the user to determine if there are any user level issues. ASAPP will reject the user's login attempt if their account is disabled.

To find an employee:

1. Login to ASAPP Admin.
2. Navigate to Employee List.
3. Use the filter to find the desired account.
4. Check account attributes for: Enabled, Roles, and Groups.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/asapp/image/uuid-24a8a576-bca7-11c2-72fb-49a4a810ee58.png" />
</Frame>

### Employee Roles Mismatch

During the user's SSO login process, ASAPP receives a list of user roles via the Single-Sign-On SAML assertion.

If the user roles in the Employee List is incorrect:

1. Check with your Identity & Access Management team to verify that the user has been added to the correct set of AD Security Groups.
2. Once you have verified the user's AD Security Groups, please ask the user to log out and log back in using the IDP-initiated SSO URL.
3. If you still see a mismatch between the user's AD Security Groups and the ASAPP Employee List, then please reach out to the ASAPP Support Team.

### Errors During User Login

The SSO flow is a series of browser redirects in the following order:

1. Your SSO engine IDP-initiated URL -- typically hosted within your domain. This is the URL that users must use to login.
2. Your system's authentication system -- typically hosted within your domain. If the user is already authenticated, then it will immediately redirect the user back to your SSO engine URL. Otherwise, the user will be presented with the login page and prompted to enter their credentials.
3. ASAPP's SSO engine -- hosted on the auth-\{customerName}.asapp.com domain.
4. ASAPP's Agent/Admin app -- hosted on the \{customerName}.asapp.com domain.

There are several potential errors that may happen during login. In all of these cases, it is beneficial to find out:

1. The SSO login URL being used by the user to login.
2. The error page URL and error message displayed.

#### Incorrect SSO Login URL

Confirm the user logins to the correct SSO URL. Due to browser redirects, users may accidentally bookmark an incorrect URL (e.g., ASAPP's SSO engine URL, instead of your SSO engine IDP-initiated URL).

#### Invalid Role Values in the SSO SAML Assertion

If the user sees a "Failed to authenticate user" error message and the URL is an ASAPP URL (...asapp.com), then please confirm that correct role values are being sent in the SAML assertion. This error message typically indicates that the user role value is not recognizable within ASAPP.

#### Other Login Errors

For any other errors, please check the error page URL. If the error page URL is an ASAPP URL (ends in asapp.com), please reach out to the ASAPP Support Team for help. If the URL is your SSO URL or your system's authentication system, please contact your internal support team.
