Source: https://ai-recruiter.micro1.ai/api-reference/getting-started/authentication

Use the micro1 dashboard to get your API key.

1. Login in to your [micro1 account.](https://www.client.micro1.ai/login)

2. Click on the bottom left to go to settings

3. Click generate API key button.

### Using the API Key

Once you have generated your API key, you need to include it in the header of each API request. The API key is passed in the header using the following format:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Example Request**

Here is an example of how to include the API key in a cURL request:

```Bash
curl -X GET https://public.api.micro1.ai/interview \
-H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Header Details**

* Header Name: x-api-key

* Header Value: YOUR\_API\_KEY
  Replace YOUR\_API\_KEY with the actual API key you generated from the client portal.

**Error Handling**

If your API key is missing, invalid, or expired, the API will respond with an error. Below are common HTTP status codes related to authentication:

* **401 Unauthorized**: The request was made without a valid API key or the key was incorrect.

* **403 Forbidden**: The API key does not have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.

**Example Error Response**

```JSON
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Unauthorized: API key is missing or invalid."
}
```


# Introduction

micro1's AI Recruiter API allows you to generate custom conversational interviews based on the skills you’d like to test. You call the API with the skills & more details about the role you’re hiring for, receive an interview link, and invite candidates.

The candidate then goes through a conversational interview and a coding exercise (if they're an engineer). After they finish, you will receive reports on how they did. The report will include an AI rating per skill, a description of that rating, soft skills rating, proctoring score, and more.

Use our AI Recruiter to interview 100x more candidates at 1/10th the cost per interview.

Any questions? reach us at [support@micro1.ai](mailto:support@micro1.ai), we'll respond within 6 hours max.
