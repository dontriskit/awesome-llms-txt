## MAGIC (Multi-Agent Generative Investment Copilots)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is MAGIC?**

MAGIC (standing for Multi-Agent Generative Investment Copilots) is our user-friendly, AI-driven tool, designed to expertly answer any financial question you throw at it.

It comprises a collaborative team of expert AI agents powered by large language models. Each agent is purpose-built to perform a particular task in financial research and analysis, meaning MAGIC can autonomously write code, use Python tools, call external APIs, or access public and private datasets on your behalf.

Best of all, you don't need any coding knowledge to use MAGIC. All you need to do is enter a prompt-for example, "Give me the most popular finance news today", "Show me Bitcoin returns since 2019", or "Can you plot US GDP YoY over the past 5 years?" and MAGIC will handle the rest.

**How does MAGIC work?**

1.  First, we construct custom benchmarks to measure and optimize performance for example tasks in financial domains.
2.  We engineer specialist knowledge and tools for the agent, enabling it to operate autonomously.
3.  We augment the LLM with prompt engineering, adjusting its contextual information and fine-tuning behavior to enhance agent performance even further.
4.  Finally, we adjust wider system processes within MAGIC to improve interactions with other agents.

**How reliable is MAGIC?**

MAGIC can be incredibly helpful in providing insights, ideas, and information. We ground the response with data provided external to the models to increase the reliability. However, as with any AI tool, you should take the results as guidance only and always exercise your independent judgment.If you want to see the code behind how MAGIC has reached a decision, you can view it in the **Actions** section of the interface.

_Please refer to our [terms and conditions](https://sigtech.com/additional-terms/) for more information._

**Will my data be visible to other users?**

No, your data will not be shared with other users. Any data you've entered, as well as the resulting MAGIC output, will remain only visible to you within the MAGIC platform.

**How do you ensure that MAGIC avoids LLM hallucinations?**

The results given by MAGIC are grounded by sourced data (i.e. from documents, computations, web pages, etc), which reduces the risk of hallucinations.

The LLMs delegate any financial analyses to the SigTech Framework API, which removes hallucinations by executing code with SigTech market data.

The final process of collating the separate worker information also allows for reflection steps to remove inaccuracies.

**How does MAGIC differ from other AI tools available in the market?**

Compared with other AI tools, MAGIC stands out with its specialist knowledge and data, high-quality quantitative insights, use of credible sources, and data-powered analysis. Each agent is specially built to deal with a particular aspect of financial research and analysis, making MAGIC an ideal tool for financial and economic professionals.

The MAGIC workflow is designed to enhance reliability, with tasks delegated to specialist agents to produce grounded, well-rounded results. While other LLMs are geared towards instant answers to quick queries, MAGIC is developed to facilitate complex problem-solving on a larger scale.

**How fast does MAGIC work?**

From receiving your prompt to coming up with a complex and detailed answer, MAGIC works in a matter of seconds. Your team of AI agents work collaboratively, carrying out their tasks to produce a solution to your query.

The planning and reviewing process is slightly slower than direct language model queries. However, this systematic process enhances the quality of MAGIC's response.

Like working with a junior quant researcher, MAGIC won't always get things right on the first go. But with MAGIC, it's much faster to go back to your agents and ask them to redo or refine something.

**What can I use MAGIC for?**

MAGIC can be used for anything related to finance, such as data analysis, strategy development, real-time insights, and more.You can use MAGIC to ask for financial insights, track the historical performance of a single stock, give an update on the latest financial news, analyze current macroeconomic factors, or even help with using SigTech's platform.Whether you're a financial journalist, portfolio manager, quantitative analyst, independent investor, or simply someone who's interested in finance, MAGIC can help get the answers you're looking for.

**Where can I get help with MAGIC?**

If you have a particular question you'd like help with, get in touch with your technical account manager or contact [support@sigtech.com](mailto:support%40sigtech.com). You can also refer to our [Getting started guide](https://guide.sigtech.com/v2/magic/) for an overview of how to use the tool.

**Are prompts used to train the model?**

No, we do not use client prompts to train the AI models.

### Prompting 101: How to write an effective prompt

###### MAGIC is designed to expertly deal with the heavy lifting of financial research, such as writing code, analyzing data, and backtesting trading strategies. Nevertheless, the hardest first step can sometimes be figuring out exactly how to make MAGIC work effectively for you. As with all large language models, the quality of MAGIC's response largely depends on the quality of the prompt it's given.

###### To help you unlock MAGIC's full capabilities, here's a quick guide on how to write useful and effective prompts.

#### What can I ask MAGIC to do?

Before you start talking to MAGIC, it's good to have an idea of what you want to use it for, as well as the output you'd like to see.

You can use MAGIC like a search engine to **learn facts** and **get information** for example:
_"What's the impact of US elections on the major US indices in the last 20 years?"_

Or you can instruct MAGIC to **carry out tasks**, such as:
_"Create an enhanced index strategy on Nasdaq 100, and compare against the performance of the index."_

Stuck on prompt ideas? Try one of the pre-made prompts that appear in the MAGIC interface.

Once you have an idea of your use case and end goal, you can begin to build your prompt to generate a more complex response.

#### Tips and tricks

*   **Give clear instructions:** Describe exactly what you want MAGIC to do, and use straightforward commands (like "Write a report" or "Include graphs"). If there are multiple steps MAGIC will need to take, outline them in sequential order. You can use bullet points and lists to structure your instructions.
*   **Provide context:** Like training a colleague, MAGIC performs better if you equip it with all the necessary information to help it succeed. It will have a better understanding of your prompt if you give detailed background information: for example, why it is carrying out a task, what your end goal is, and any surrounding information that helps to set the scene. Although MAGIC can achieve a lot with a simple prompt, adding context will help it craft a more nuanced response.
*   **Be specific about what you would like MAGIC to do:** If you want it to write code or create data visualizations as part of its response, let it know. If you want to track the performance of a single stock for a particular period of time, specify the exact length of time. That way, you'll tailor MAGIC's response to be as relevant as possible.
*   **Break complex prompts down:** While it's great to provide all the necessary contextual information and specific details, MAGIC can sometimes get overloaded by particularly big queries. As a result, it may forget certain details or skip steps when trying to handle everything in one go. Try prompt chaining, in which you break down long prompts into smaller sub-tasks. This helps MAGIC gather its thoughts and focus at each step, which reduces the chance of mishandling a sub-task. Also, try to stick to one idea per prompt. If you want to ask MAGIC about something unrelated, it's best to start a new conversation instead.
*   **Use natural, conversational language:** MAGIC is powered by large language models, so the best way to interact with it is by using natural language. Talk to it as you would with a human.
*   **Direct your query to specific agents:** Each agent in the MAGIC team has been specially designed to deal with a particular task in financial research and analysis. For example, the Fed Analyst can access Federal Reserve FOMC documents, while the SigTech Quant can retrieve financial market data and perform backtesting. So, it's well worth making use of their individual expertise. Type '@' in the chat to bring up the list of available agents you can talk directly to.
*   **Ask MAGIC to repeat or redo a response:** Large language models can sometimes produce hallucinations: this is information that's incorrect or unrelated to your query. In such instances, you can ask MAGIC to review its own work and make corrections, or directly @ the Planner agent to walk you through how a response was generated. By asking MAGIC to self-evaluate and iterate its answer, you can gently steer it back on track.

#### Example

This is how we used MAGIC to come up with a recent [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7237461212773453825) about the US Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). By providing context and asking for specific information, we were able to guide MAGIC to produce a helpful and detailed response.

**Vague prompt**
_"Can you tell me about the PMI trends over the recent years?"_

In this instance, MAGIC did its best to fill in any gaps and provide a general overview. While it was still a useful starting point for learning about a brand new topic and summarizing key points, it didn't provide the level of detail and specificity we wanted to see.

So, using the tips and tricks above, we made some improvements to the prompt..

**Specific prompt**
_"The US PMI recently shot up in Q2 of 2024. Can you chart the historical PMI trends for the past 10 years?_

_Given the current circumstances, what are the economic indicators suggesting the potential timing for a recovery from the recent 21-month contraction trend in the US PMI, and if contractions persist, what are the likely PMI trends over the next 6 months based on key influencing factors and recent data?_

_Give clear graphs and tables to corroborate your responses._"

In this example, we provided context by mentioning the recent US PMI trend, before asking MAGIC to look back at previous PMI trends. We specified the time periods for MAGIC to look at, such as historical PMI trends over the past ten years and the PMI forecast for the next six months. We also instructed MAGIC to include graphs and tables in its response.

Finally, we broke down the prompt into multiple sub-tasks for MAGIC to tackle, one step at a time. As a result, MAGIC's response was much more refined: it produced the exact data visualizations we wanted to see, and addressed the specific bits of information we highlighted.

#### Fair Usage Policy

**Last Updated April 2023**

SigTech implements a fair usage policy to ensure that all of our users can have the best experience when using the SigTech services and products.

We expect that the majority of our users will not be impacted by this Fair Usage Policy. However, when using the SigTech services:

*   You must only use our services as defined by us in the applicable terms of service.
*   You must only use our platforms and services for the purpose advertised, described in any user guides or training guides, or as instructed by us.
*   You must not use our platforms or services in a way which deliberately games or exploits to your advantage the design of our services, systems or billing plan (if applicable).

You must not use our platforms or services fraudulently, in connection with a criminal offence, in breach of any law or statutory duty, to send, upload, download, use or reuse any material, which is offensive, abusive, indecent, defamatory, obscene or menacing, a nuisance (including to our staff) or a hoax in breach of anyone's rights or privacy or is otherwise unlawful.

The examples above are not an exhaustive list of how you could be breaching our Fair Usage Policy. There may be other activities which we reasonably believe to be outside the legitimate use which may also be subject to the terms in this Fair Usage Policy.

In addition, if the volume of data you submit to one of our Platforms is excessive, or the size of the data is disproportionately large, this can adversely affect our ability to provide services efficiently and effectively to our other users.  This type of behaviour may be in breach of this Fair Usage Policy.

If in SigTech's reasonable opinion, you are abusing the service in a way which exceeds fair usage, we may ask you to moderate your behaviour. We may in extreme or persistent cases, suspend or even terminate your access to SigTech's services.

If you claim an implied contract or duty exists between you and a third-party provider, or an implied contract or duty is held to exist, SigTech disclaims all liability of each third-party provider for any of your losses which may arise under that implied contract or duty.

Third-party providers provide their data, software and services on an "as is" basis and do not warrant that the provision of their data, software or services will be uninterrupted, error free, timely, complete, or accurate, nor do any of them make any warranties as to the results to be obtained from use of the same.

This helps us to improve the way our site and/or services work, for example, by determining whether you can find information easily, or by identifying the aspects of the site and/or services that are of the most interest to you.

Below is a list of third party cookies we use which are likely to be analytical cookies, performance cookies or targeting cookies:

*   **Google Analytics**. Our third-party analytics tool provider (a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., whose servers may be in the UK, EU or in the USA). Google Analytics is a Google product which helps us understand how people engage with our website, using a set of cookies to collect information and report site usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The information obtained through these cookies may be disclosed to, or collected directly by, Google Analytics. For more information about Google Analytics' cookie and information practices (including the types of cookies used and their expiration date), please visit the link here: [Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
*   **HubSpot.** We use these cookies to collect information about how visitors use our site. HubSpot tracks visitors using browser cookies. These cookies track a visitor's movements as they navigate across the different pages of our website. The cookies will only personally identify website visitors if they are an existing contact in our system. Visitors who are not contacts in our system will be assigned a cookie but will be tracked anonymously and will not be personally identified. For more information about HubSpot's cookie and information practices (including the types of cookies used and their expiration date), please visit the link here: [HubSpot Privacy Policy](https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy?__hstc=210022090.50ebcc09ad528cd0de215765f66adb49.1667214802411.1670507300397.1670582428254.8&__hssc=210022090.1.1670582428254&__hsfp=4068571554).
*   **Hotjar.** We use these cookies in order to better understand our users' needs and to optimise our service and experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don't like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users' behaviour and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymised user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf. For further details, please see the 'about Hotjar' section of [Hotjar's support site](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/categories/115001323967-About-Hotjar).
*   **LinkedIn.** We install a custom LinkedIn pixel on our website which enables LinkedIn to create a cookie in the browser of any visitors, meaning a LinkedIn account holder can be retargeted via LinkedIn advertising. To find out more about LinkedIn's pixel, please visit the link here: [LinkedIn Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy#:~:text=We%20use%20pixels%20to%20learn,place%20cookies%20on%20your%20browser.&text=Local%20storage%20enables%20a%20website,on%20your%20device(s).)
