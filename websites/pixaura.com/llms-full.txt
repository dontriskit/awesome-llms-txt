In today’s competitive landscape, standing out is no easy feat. Enter unconventional brand collaborations—where brands with different aesthetics, values, or even industries come together to create something unexpected. From luxury fashion partnering with fast food to tech companies teaming up with artists, these unlikely alliances can be marketing gold. But they’re not without their challenges. Let’s explore the benefits, potential pitfalls, and examples of how unconventional brand collaborations can boost your brand’s reach and relevance.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Why Go Unconventional?&nbsp;&nbsp;



Traditional partnerships make sense—fitness brands collaborate with health food companies, and outdoor gear brands team up with adventure travel agencies. But unconventional collaborations push boundaries and capture attention in new ways. Here’s why they’re worth considering:&nbsp;&nbsp;




Reach New Audiences: Partnering with a brand outside your typical space gives you access to a fresh and diverse audience. For example, when Crocs teamed up with luxury fashion house Balenciaga, they captured both high-fashion lovers and quirky footwear fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Boost Brand Perception: Unconventional partnerships can reshape how people perceive your brand. They show that you’re innovative, bold, and willing to take risks. Think of Taco Bell’s collaboration with Forever 21—unexpected but undeniably buzzworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Generate Buzz and Media Coverage: Unusual collaborations have a higher likelihood of going viral or grabbing media attention. The sheer “Wait, what?” factor makes people talk, tweet, and share.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Create Limited-Edition Exclusivity: Collaborations often result in limited-edition products, driving demand through scarcity. Hype builds around the unique nature of the partnership, creating must-have items for loyal fans of both brands.&nbsp;&nbsp;




Challenges of Unconventional Collaborations&nbsp;&nbsp;



While these partnerships can be exciting, they’re not without their complexities. Here’s what to watch out for:&nbsp;&nbsp;




Mismatch in Brand Values: If the brands’ core values clash, it can confuse or alienate loyal customers. It’s essential to find common ground despite aesthetic or industry differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Risk of Diluting Your Brand: An unconventional collaboration can enhance your brand—or dilute it. When two wildly different brands work together, there’s a fine line between creative and confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Execution Complexity: Managing joint marketing efforts, creative direction, and product logistics can be challenging. Miscommunication or misalignment on expectations can derail the partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Customer Skepticism: Audiences can be wary of collaborations that feel forced or purely opportunistic. Authenticity matters. Collaborations should be meaningful and aligned in some way, even if it’s unexpected.&nbsp;&nbsp;




Successful Examples of Unconventional Brand Collaborations&nbsp;&nbsp;




Adidas x LEGO: Blending sportswear with playful creativity, this partnership produced colorful, LEGO-inspired sneakers that appealed to sneakerheads and nostalgic toy lovers alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Oreo x Supreme: A high-fashion label and a cookie brand might seem like an odd mix, but this limited-edition collab generated massive buzz and resale prices soaring into the hundreds for a single pack of cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;



GoPro x Red Bull: Their shared focus on adventure and extreme sports made the collaboration a natural fit. Together, they created stunning content and live events, expanding their reach to thrill-seekers and adventurers worldwide.




Tips for Creating a Successful Unconventional Collaboration&nbsp;&nbsp;



If you’re considering stepping outside the box with your next partnership, keep these tips in mind:&nbsp;&nbsp;




Find a Shared Story: Even if your brands seem worlds apart, there should be a shared narrative or value that connects you. For instance, both brands might celebrate creativity, innovation, or nostalgia.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Focus on the Experience: The most successful collaborations go beyond products. They create a memorable experience—whether through a pop-up event, an interactive digital campaign, or creative packaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Be Authentic: Audiences can sense when something feels forced. Make sure the collaboration aligns with your brand’s essence, even if it’s a little unexpected.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Plan for the Long Term: Don’t just chase the buzz. Think about how the collaboration will contribute to your long-term brand strategy and customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;




Should You Go Unconventional?&nbsp;&nbsp;



Unconventional brand collaborations are bold, exciting, and full of potential. They offer an opportunity to break through the noise and reach new audiences—but only if done right. If you’re ready to push boundaries and explore creative partnerships, Pixaura can help. Let’s collaborate to make your next campaign something unforgettable. Contact us today!&nbsp;

# Integrating Google Ads with Google Analytics: Deeper Insights, Better Performance

If you're running Google Ads but haven't linked them to Google Analytics, you're missing out on a treasure trove of data that can supercharge your marketing efforts. Integrating these two powerful platforms gives you a clearer picture of your audience, their behavior, and how your ads influence their journey. Here’s why linking Google Ads with Google Analytics is essential—and how to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Why You Should Link Google Ads with Google Analytics&nbsp;&nbsp;



When you connect Google Ads with Google Analytics, you get access to actionable insights that help you optimize your campaigns. Here are some key benefits:&nbsp;&nbsp;




Track the Full Customer Journey: Google Ads tells you which campaigns bring in traffic, but Google Analytics shows you what happens after visitors land on your site. You’ll see which pages they visit, how long they stay, and whether they convert—or leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Enhanced Conversion Tracking: Track micro and macro conversions like newsletter signups, purchases, or form submissions. With integrated data, you can better attribute conversions to the right keywords, ads, and campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Optimize Campaigns with Behavioral Data: Behavioral insights—like bounce rate, average session duration, and pages per session—help you identify what’s working and what needs improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Improved Remarketing Opportunities: Target users more effectively by creating remarketing lists in Google Analytics and using them in your Google Ads campaigns. For example, retarget visitors who abandoned their shopping carts or spent a significant amount of time on a specific page.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Access to Advanced Reports: Google Analytics offers detailed reports like multi-channel funnels and attribution modeling, helping you understand how different channels work together to drive conversions.&nbsp;&nbsp;




How to Link Google Ads with Google Analytics&nbsp;&nbsp;



Linking the two platforms is a straightforward process. Here’s a step-by-step guide:&nbsp;&nbsp;




Make sure you’re signed in to both your Google Ads and Google Analytics accounts using the same email address with admin-level permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;



In Analytics, navigate to the Admin section. Under Property Settings, select “Google Ads Linking”.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Click on “New Link Group” and choose the Google Ads account you want to link.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Check the box for “All Web Data” to ensure you capture data across your entire site.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Click “Link Accounts”, and you’re done! It may take 24–48 hours for data to sync, but once it does, you’ll have deeper insights into your campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;




What to Analyze Once Linked&nbsp;&nbsp;



Once your accounts are connected, here are some metrics and reports you should pay attention to:&nbsp;&nbsp;




Campaign Performance: Track which campaigns, ad groups, and keywords drive the most conversions.&nbsp;&nbsp;



User Behavior Flow: Understand how users move through your site and where they drop off.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Attribution Reports: Analyze the entire customer journey, not just the last click before conversion.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Goals and Events: Set up specific goals (like form submissions or video views) to measure campaign effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;




Take Your Campaigns to the Next Level&nbsp;&nbsp;



Integrating Google Ads with Google Analytics is a must to maximize advertising ROI. By linking these platforms, you’ll get the data you need to make smarter decisions, optimize your campaigns, and create better experiences for your customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Email Deliverability: 7 Tips to Stay Out of the Spam Folder

Full Content:
Getting your email in front of your audience is more than just crafting the perfect subject line or eye-catching design. If your email ends up in the spam folder, none of that effort will matter. Understanding email deliverability, and how to improve it, is crucial for any business that relies on email communication.



What Is Email Deliverability?



Email deliverability refers to the ability of your emails to successfully land in your recipients’ inboxes. Factors like sender reputation, content, and engagement levels play a significant role in determining whether your emails make it past spam filters.



Why Do Emails Land in the Spam Folder?



There are several reasons why emails might end up in spam:




Poor Sender Reputation: Internet service providers (ISPs) monitor your domain’s and IP address’s reputation. High bounce rates or frequent complaints can harm your reputation.



Spammy Content: Using certain words, phrases, or formatting (e.g., excessive capitalization or exclamation marks) can trigger spam filters.



Lack of Authentication: Failing to set up email authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC can make your emails appear less trustworthy.



Low Engagement: If recipients consistently ignore your emails or mark them as spam, ISPs will deprioritize your messages.




Tips for Staying Out of the Spam Folder



1. Authenticate Your Emails



Email authentication protocols, such as:




SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Verifies that your email comes from an authorized server.



DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Adds a digital signature to confirm your email’s authenticity.



DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): Aligns SPF and DKIM policies to prevent spoofing.




These protocols boost your credibility with ISPs and reduce the likelihood of your emails being marked as spam.



2. Maintain a Clean Email List



Regularly clean your email list to remove invalid addresses and inactive subscribers. High bounce rates hurt your sender reputation. Use double opt-in methods to ensure subscribers genuinely want your emails. 



3. Create High-Quality, Non-Spammy Content




Avoid excessive use of spam-trigger words like “Free,” “Winner,” or “Urgent.”



Limit excessive punctuation and capitalization (e.g., “ACT NOW!!!”).



Ensure your email includes valuable, relevant content for your audience.



Always include an unsubscribe link to comply with laws like CAN-SPAM and GDPR.




4. Optimize for Engagement



Engagement signals, such as opens, clicks, and replies, indicate to ISPs that your emails are relevant and wanted. To encourage engagement:




Personalize subject lines and email content.



Use clear CTAs (calls-to-action).



Segment your audience for targeted messaging.




5. Monitor Your Metrics



Track metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and bounce rates. Low engagement and high bounce rates can indicate issues with your email campaigns. Use tools like Google Postmaster Tools or other email deliverability platforms to monitor your sender reputation.



6. Use a Reputable Email Service Provider (ESP)



A reputable ESP ensures proper infrastructure for email sending, such as IP warm-up strategies, authentication setups, and monitoring tools.



7. Test Before Sending



Before launching an email campaign, run tests using tools that simulate spam filters. These tools provide insights on improvements to ensure higher deliverability.



Conclusion



Achieving high email deliverability is an ongoing process that requires attention to detail and best practices. By authenticating your emails, maintaining a clean email list, crafting quality content, and monitoring engagement, you can improve your chances of staying out of the spam folder and connecting with your audience effectively.

Redefining the Game to Capture Market Share



In markets dominated by established brands, challengers often face an uphill battle to gain recognition. Challenger brand strategies require adopting a mindset of innovation, disruption, and boldness to redefine the industry’s rules. By leveraging their unique position, challenger brands can bring about change and carve out a niche in a competitive market.



What Defines a Challenger Brand?



Challenger brands are those that intentionally position themselves against market leaders, not by trying to mimic them but by offering an alternative that resonates with overlooked or underserved audiences.&nbsp;



They often have fewer resources but compensate with creativity, agility, and a willingness to take risks. Think of brands like Oatly disrupting the dairy industry or Warby Parker challenging the traditional eyewear retail model.



Key Strategies for Challenger Brands




Define a Clear Point of Difference to stand out. Challenger brands must offer something distinctly different from the incumbents. This could be a unique product feature, a more affordable price point, or a brand mission that aligns with the values of modern consumers.

Example: Oatly positioned itself as not just an alternative to milk but as a sustainable lifestyle choice, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.





Embrace Bold Storytelling to create emotional connections. By crafting a compelling narrative, brands can appeal to consumers who are looking for authenticity and alignment with their values.

Example: Patagonia’s environmental advocacy has turned its brand into a movement, attracting customers who share their commitment to sustainability.





Leverage Agility and Speed to capitalize quickly on trends and customer feedback. Challenger brands often have smaller teams and fewer bureaucratic hurdles, and this agility can be a significant advantage in industries where larger players are slower to adapt.

Example: Glossier’s rapid prototyping of products based on customer input allowed them to outpace traditional beauty brands in certain segments.





Tap into Underserved Markets to establish a loyal customer base. Identifying and addressing the needs of niche or underserved audiences often involves listening to communities that have been ignored by larger players.

Example: Fenty Beauty’s inclusive range of foundation shades redefined beauty industry standards, making it a leader in inclusivity.





Challenge Industry Norms to attract attention. By questioning and reimagining how things have always been done, challenger brands can disrupt traditional models.

Example: Dollar Shave Club’s subscription-based razor model disrupted the razor industry’s reliance on expensive products and complex pricing structures.






Overcoming Challenges



While the challenger mindset offers significant advantages, it also comes with challenges. Limited budgets, intense competition, and the pressure to maintain momentum can be daunting. However, with strategic focus and a commitment to innovation, challenger brands can overcome these hurdles. Leveraging partnerships, focusing on digital-first strategies, and maintaining a clear vision can help sustain growth.



Why the Challenger Mindset Matters



The challenger mindset isn’t limited to small or emerging brands—even established players can adopt this approach to reinvent themselves and remain relevant. By focusing on customer-centric innovation and challenging the status quo, brands can maintain their edge in an ever-changing market.



Conclusion



Challenger brands prove that you don’t need to be the biggest player to make an impact. By embracing bold strategies, questioning traditional norms, and connecting deeply with consumers, these brands can not only capture market share but also redefine their industries. For businesses looking to grow and disrupt, the challenger mindset is a powerful blueprint for success.

# Maximizing Performance with Responsive Search Ads

Keeping up with evolving ad formats can mean the difference between campaign success and mediocrity. Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) are Google’s answer to the demand for adaptability and performance optimization in search campaigns. This guide will help you understand RSAs and how to harness their full potential to boost your ad performance.



What Are Responsive Search Ads?



Responsive Search Ads allow advertisers to input multiple headlines and descriptions, which Google’s algorithm then mixes and matches to display the most relevant combinations for each search query. This dynamic format is designed to improve ad relevance, click-through rates (CTR), and overall campaign performance.



Why Use Responsive Search Ads?




Improved Relevance: Google’s machine learning identifies and serves the best-performing combinations for specific audiences and search queries.



Enhanced Efficiency: Advertisers can test multiple ad variations simultaneously without creating multiple static ads.



Increased Reach: With more combinations, RSAs have a better chance of appearing in auctions and serving diverse audience intents.




Best Practices for Creating Effective RSAs



1. Leverage the Maximum Input



Google allows up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions per RSA. Use as many variations as possible to provide the algorithm with a diverse pool to test.




Headlines should focus on your unique selling points, calls to action, and keywords.



Descriptions should highlight benefits, features, or promotions to entice potential customers.




2. Focus on Quality and Clarity



While quantity matters, quality is paramount. Ensure each headline and description conveys a clear, compelling message. Avoid redundancy by making each variation unique, and maintain grammatical accuracy and professionalism.



3. Incorporate Target Keywords



Include your primary and secondary keywords strategically in the headlines and descriptions to improve ad relevance and quality score. However, avoid keyword stuffing.



4. Pin Essential Content



Use the pinning feature to control the placement of critical messages, such as legal disclaimers, brand names, or specific calls to action.



5. Test and Analyze Performance




Monitor the asset performance ratings (“Best,” “Good,” “Low”) in the Google Ads interface to identify top-performing variations.



Replace underperforming headlines or descriptions with new ones to maintain optimization.




6. Write for Mobile Users



Ensure your headlines and descriptions are concise and impactful, especially for mobile devices where screen space is limited.



Common Pitfalls to Avoid




Over-Pinning Content: Excessive pinning can limit the algorithm’s ability to test combinations, reducing the effectiveness of RSAs.



Neglecting Performance Data: Failing to analyze and act on performance insights can result in missed opportunities for improvement.



Relying Solely on Automation: While RSAs are powerful, a well-structured campaign with relevant keywords and ad groups is essential for success.




Final Thoughts



Responsive Search Ads are a powerful tool for advertisers aiming to optimize their campaigns for better performance. By understanding and applying the best practices outlined in this guide, you can maximize the potential of RSAs to drive engagement, conversions, and ROI.

# Data Lakes and Content for your ChatGPT-ready Site
> I asked ChatGPT and Gemini the following question. "Would it help if I put all the data on my site in a data lake for you (ChatGPT &amp; Gemini) to crawl and get all the content? if so, how would&hellip;

Full Content:
I asked ChatGPT and Gemini the following question.





"Would it help if I put all the data on my site in a data lake for you (ChatGPT &amp; Gemini) to crawl and get all the content? if so, how would I organize this data? In JSON structure?"





ChatGPT's Answer



That's a great idea! Using a structured format like a data lake with JSON data would certainly help make your site's content more accessible for advanced AI tools or even your internal analysis. However, while I can't directly crawl your data lake or website due to security and privacy policies, I can guide you on how to structure it so it’s accessible for future tools or APIs.



Why a Data Lake is Useful:



A data lake serves as a centralized repository where you can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in its raw form. If organized properly, it can be useful for advanced analytics, AI tools, or APIs.







Best Practices for Structuring Data for a Data Lake:



1. JSON Format for Structured Data



JSON is an excellent choice because it's lightweight, human-readable, and easy to process. A typical structure might look like this:



Gemini's Answer



That's an interesting idea to create a "website data lake" for me to crawl! While it's not strictly necessary for me to access your website content (I can generally crawl and understand publicly available webpages), there are some potential benefits to organizing your data this way:



Potential Benefits:




Improved comprehension: A well-structured data lake could help me understand the relationships between different pieces of content on your site more easily. This could lead to more accurate and comprehensive responses to user queries.



Faster access: Direct access to a data lake could potentially be faster than crawling individual web pages, especially for large websites.



Handling complex data: If your website contains a lot of dynamic content or data that's not easily accessible through traditional crawling (e.g., user-generated content, internal APIs), a data lake can provide a centralized and standardized way to access it.








JSON is indeed a good choice for structuring your data in a website data lake. Here's how you might approach it:




Schema: Define a clear schema for your JSON documents. This schema should capture the essential elements of your website content, such as:

Page URL



Page title



Headings and subheadings



Body text



Images and their captions



Metadata (e.g., keywords, author, publication date)



Links to other pages on your site





Relationships: Consider how different pieces of content relate to each other. You might use nested JSON structures or link documents through unique identifiers to represent these relationships.



Segmentation: For very large websites, you might want to segment your data lake into different zones or categories based on content type or purpose.




Gemini's JSON recommendation:



{
  "url": "https://www.example.com/about-us",
  "title": "About Us",
  "headings": &#91;"Our Mission", "Our Team", "Our History"],
  "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...",
  "images": &#91;
    {
      "src": "https://www.example.com/images/team.jpg",
      "caption": "Meet our team"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "keywords": &#91;"about", "company", "team"],
    "author": "John Doe",
    "publication_date": "2023-10-26"
  },
  "links": &#91;
    "https://www.example.com/contact",
    "https://www.example.com/blog"
  ]
}




ChatGPT's JSON Data Lake Recommendation



{
  "articles": &#91;
    {
      "id": "123",
      "title": "The Benefits of Data Lakes",
      "content": "A data lake allows for flexible storage of data...",
      "category": "Tech",
      "tags": &#91;"data lake", "technology"],
      "author": "John Doe",
      "datePublished": "2025-01-15"
    },
    {
      "id": "124",
      "title": "How to Use JSON in Data Lakes",
      "content": "JSON is an ideal format for storing structured data...",
      "category": "Programming",
      "tags": &#91;"JSON", "data lake", "coding"],
      "author": "Jane Doe",
      "datePublished": "2025-01-20"
    }
  ]
}









Conclusion



I think a website needs to be structured so that all the content is readily available to chatbots. This includes ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, and most importantly, the Chatbot built into the site --- stay tuned for this conversation. 



I know that you can use a service like Pinecone.ai but I think building this data lake directly into the site would be a great source for feeding the chatbots. This is the new robots.txt

GEO Reference




Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) refers to the process of optimizing content, prompts, or strategies to maximize the effectiveness and relevance of generative AI outputs. Similar to SEO (Search Engine Optimization), GEO focuses on tailoring inputs to align with the generative model's strengths, ensuring high-quality, accurate, and user-specific results. This includes crafting well-structured prompts, understanding the model’s contextual behavior, and iterating to refine outputs for desired outcomes. GEO is increasingly vital as businesses and creators leverage generative AI for applications like content generation, product descriptions, and personalized customer interactions.



Data Lakes: A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.



Data clustering for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) refers to the process of organizing and grouping similar pieces of information or content into clusters, enabling more efficient and accurate responses from AI chatbots and generative models. In GEO, clustering ensures that content is well-structured and contextually relevant, making it easier for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to retrieve and generate appropriate answers to user prompts.

# Email List Fatigue: How to Re-Engage Your Audience

Email marketing is a powerful tool for maintaining customer relationships and driving conversions. But even the most well-crafted campaigns experience diminishing returns with time as subscribers grow weary of your messages. This phenomenon, known as email list fatigue, leads to reduced open rates, engagement, and overall effectiveness of your email marketing strategy.



If your email metrics are trending downward, it’s time to take action. Here’s how to re-engage your audience and keep your campaigns fresh and impactful.



1. Segment Your List



Not all subscribers are the same, and treating them as such can lead to disengagement. Use segmentation to tailor your messages to different audience groups based on factors like:




Purchase history



Engagement level



Geographic location



Demographic information




By sending relevant content to specific groups, you’ll increase the chances of capturing their attention and reigniting interest.



2. Audit Your Content



If subscribers aren’t engaging, your content might not be meeting their expectations. Consider the following questions:




Are your emails offering value?



Are they visually appealing and easy to read?



Is your messaging aligned with your audience’s current interests?




Conduct A/B tests on subject lines, email design, and calls to action (CTAs) to identify what resonates most with your audience.



3. Re-Engagement Campaigns



A well-timed campaign can help win back inactive subscribers. Here are some strategies:




Special Offers: Provide exclusive discounts or incentives to encourage interaction.



Feedback Requests: Ask subscribers what they’d like to see more of in your emails.



Surprise and Delight: Share a fun or unexpected piece of content to rekindle interest.



Reaffirmation: Send an email asking if they’d like to stay subscribed, making it easy for them to opt-out or update their preferences.




4. Personalization Is Key



Generic emails are easy to ignore. Leverage the data you have on your subscribers to make your messages personal. Use their first name, reference past purchases, or recommend products based on their browsing behavior. Personalized emails can significantly boost engagement and show your audience that you value them as individuals.



5. Optimize Send Frequency



Sending emails too frequently can overwhelm your audience, while infrequent emails can lead to disengagement. Experiment with different sending schedules to find the sweet spot that keeps your brand top of mind without being intrusive.



6. Revamp Your Subject Lines



Subject lines are your first impression, and a dull or irrelevant one can lead to immediate deletion. Craft subject lines that are:




Short and compelling



Informative yet intriguing



Reflective of the content inside




Using questions, numbers, or emojis strategically can also increase open rates.



7. Integrate Other Channels



Sometimes, email list fatigue stems from over-reliance on the medium. Diversify your communication channels by:




Retargeting inactive subscribers with social media ads



Encouraging followers to join exclusive groups or communities



Sending direct messages or connecting through platforms like LinkedIn




By complementing email with other strategies, you can reach your audience in fresh and exciting ways.



The Bottom Line



Email list fatigue isn’t a death sentence for your campaigns, but it is a sign to recalibrate your approach. By leveraging segmentation, personalization, and re-engagement strategies, you can breathe new life into your email marketing and keep your audience connected.

# Real-Time Engagement is Essential for Modern Brands

In the fast-paced digital world, consumers expect more than static ads and scheduled posts; they demand authentic, real-time interactions with their favorite brands. Real-time engagement—connecting with customers instantly through social media comments, live chats, and instant feedback systems—is a cornerstone of modern marketing. 



Why Real-Time Engagement Is Crucial




Builds Stronger Relationships. Real-time responses create immediacy and connection. When a customer feels heard and valued, trust grows. Brands that interact promptly foster loyalty.



Meets Consumer Expectations. A HubSpot study revealed that 90% of customers rate a response within 10 minutes as crucial when they have a concern. Slow responses, on the other hand, can lead to frustration and potential loss of business.



Enhances Brand Transparency. Real-time interaction humanizes your brand, showing authenticity and openness. Responding to compliments or addressing complaints demonstrates integrity and accountability.




Channels for Real-Time Engagement




Social Media. Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok thrive on immediacy. Responding to comments, joining trending conversations, or hosting live Q&amp;A sessions shows your brand is present and engaged. Several tools are available to monitor your mentions in real time.



Live Chat Support. Integrating live chat on your website improves customer satisfaction. AI chatbots like Intercom can handle routine queries, while human agents tackle complex issues.



Interactive Stories and Polls. Instagram and Facebook stories with polls, quizzes, and live reactions invite immediate audience participation and boost engagement rates.



Push Notifications and SMS. Personalized, time-sensitive offers or updates sent directly to your audience keeps them informed and engaged without feeling spammed.




Tips for Effective Real-Time Engagement




Be Proactive. Don’t always wait for customers to reach out—initiate conversations. Acknowledge feedback, share user-generated content, or surprise loyal customers with shoutouts.



Stay Authentic. Avoid scripted responses and tailor your communication to the context and tone of the customer. Authenticity resonates more than robotic replies.



Leverage Analytics. Utilize tools like Google Analytics or Meta Business Suite to track when your audience is most active. Engage during these peak times to maximize visibility and response rates.



Train Your Team. Equip your customer service and social media teams with the tools and skills to respond effectively in real time. Clear guidelines ensure a consistent brand voice across interactions.




What's the ROI?



Real-time engagement drives both short- and long-term value for brands. It improves customer retention, increases positive brand sentiment, and often leads to higher conversion rates. In a competitive marketplace, brands that excel in this area will stand out as customer-centric leaders.

# Is Search Dead? Will AI LLMs Rule the World?

Full Content:
The rise of powerful AI Language Models like ChatGPT and Gemini has sparked a flurry of discussions about the future of search. Will these sophisticated AI replace traditional search engines like Google? While LLMs (Large Language Models) offer a revolutionary approach to information retrieval, it's unlikely that search is dead. Instead, we're witnessing a significant shift in how we access and consume information.







With the influx of AI and LLMs will people go to these solutions for answers versus Google Search?Will search be specific to products and things? Or will all the answers be inside LLMs?



How can your business ensure it gets mentioned in ChatGPT, Gemini, and other LLM answers?







When I want help writing or refining something, I use Google Gemini or OpenAi ChatGPT. I don't go to these solutions to find "What Companies provide AS/400 RPG programmers?" I would generally go to Google for that.But, I decided to test this theory. I asked Gemini, Google Search, ChatGPT, Bing, and MS CoPilot the same question, "What Companies provide AS/400 RPG programmers?" and I'm not surprised by the results. I'm doing this research for a specific company called Programmers.io and want to see where they are positioned in the results.



Gemini LLM - "What Companies provide AS/400 RPG programmers?"







Robert Half, Apex Systems, TekSystems, and Programmers.io are the Staffing Agencies selected by Google Gemini. 



O.K., let's do a Google Search.



Google Search - "What Companies provide AS/400 RPG programmers?"



The answers from Google Search are similar to Gemini. But not exact with IBM, Integrative Systems, and Programmers.io.







But, then I thought, in Google Search I'm not in "Conversation Mode" and I would simply search for a keyword or phrase. Instead of "What companies provide the best AS/400 Programmers?" I would most likely search for "AS/400 Programmers." it's our natural behavior to search for the thing, product, or solution in Google.



Google Search - "AS400 Programmers"







I got a couple different results. But, I noticed Google believes my search intent is general information about AS/400 RPG Programmers.







ChatGPT - "What Companies provide AS/400 RPG programmers?"







ChatGPT Results are very similar to Google Search. With Response 1 including Integrative Systems, Programmers.io, and Berkshire eSupply and Response 2 includes Integrative Systems, Programmers.io, and Talsco, inc. 



Bing - "What Companies provide AS/400 RPG programmers?"







Look at all the Integrative Systems results for this search in Bing. The #1 result and all of the knowledge boxes are different blog posts relative to AS400 RPG Programmers. It's evident they are making the investment in content around this topic to be #1 for SEARCH and AI.



Microsoft CoPilot - "What Companies provide AS/400 RPG programmers?"







CoPilot has a new contender — Silveredge Consulting in position #1 with Programmers.io and Integrative Systems in 2 and 3.



SEO in the Age of AI - LLMO or GEO



After these quick tests I believe AI SEO is just glorified SEO but with more of a conversation approach to your specific question. BUT, the top answers match Google and Bing results. Which, makes me believe that LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini grade, rate, store, their results in a similar way that search engines do — based on the quality of the data sources.



The emergence of LLMs necessitates a shift in SEO strategies to remain relevant. LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization) or GEO (Generative Engine Optimization). If you want to succeed in the paradigm shift of AI providing answers, you need to ensure your site is providing valuable content and you ARE the domain authority.




Focus on High-Quality Content: LLMs prioritize high-quality, informative, and well-structured content. &nbsp;



Optimize for Conversational Queries: Tailor content to answer common user questions in a conversational and informative style. &nbsp;



Leverage Structured Data: Implement schema markup to help search engines and LLMs better understand your website's content. &nbsp;



Build Authority: Focus on building strong brand authority and establishing yourself as a trusted source of information.



LLMO &amp; GEO: LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization) or GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)




Conclusion:



Search is not dead, but it's evolving. LLMs are transforming how we interact with information, offering new opportunities and challenges. By embracing AI-driven SEO strategies, businesses can ensure their online presence remains visible and effective in this rapidly changing landscape.



Key Takeaways:




LLMs are changing the search landscape, but not replacing it.



Search engines are adapting to the AI era with new features and functionalities. &nbsp;



High-quality, informative, and well-structured content remains crucial for SEO success. &nbsp;



Businesses need to adapt their SEO strategies to the evolving needs of search engines and LLMs with LLMO and GEO.

What Are Negative Keywords?



Negative keywords are words or phrases you tell Google Ads to exclude from your campaigns. When someone searches for a term that contains a negative keyword, your ad won’t show up. This ensures your ads only appear for searches relevant to your business.



Example: A florist running ads for wedding arrangements might add “free” as a negative keyword to avoid showing their ads for searches like “free flowers.”



Benefits of Using Negative Keywords




Improved Click-Through Rate (CTR): By avoiding irrelevant searches, your ads attract more clicks from qualified leads. This leads to higher CTR, a key factor in improving ad performance.



Cost Savings: Irrelevant clicks cost money without delivering value. Negative keywords help you allocate your budget more efficiently.




Higher Quality Score: Google rewards relevant ads with higher Quality Scores, leading to better ad placements and lower costs-per-click (CPC).



How to Identify Negative Keywords




Use the Search Terms Report. The Search Terms Report in Google Ads shows the actual searches triggering your ads. Review this report regularly to identify irrelevant or unqualified terms.



Brainstorm Common Misinterpretations. Think about terms that might trigger your ad but don’t align with your offering. 



Research Competitor Ads. Analyze competitor targeting to spot areas in which you don’t want to compete. 



Use Keyword Research Tools. Platforms like Google Keyword Planner or SEMrush can reveal irrelevant terms commonly associated with your keywords.




Best Practices for Implementing Negative Keywords




Group Negative Keywords by Campaign. Keep negative keywords specific to each campaign. For example, an e-commerce store might exclude “job openings” in a campaign promoting products but allow it in a campaign recruiting employees.



Match Types Matter. Just like regular keywords, negative keywords have match types:

Broad Match blocks searches containing your negative keyword in any order.



Phrase Match blocks searches containing the exact phrase in the same order.



Exact Match blocks searches matching the negative keyword precisely.





Update Regularly. Monitor performance and refine your list of negative keywords. New trends or changes in search behavior may require adjustments.




Common Mistakes to Avoid




Overusing Broad Match Negative Keywords. Using overly broad terms can unintentionally block relevant queries. For example, excluding “free” might block valuable searches like “free shipping.”



Ignoring Synonyms and Variations. Include plural forms, abbreviations, and common misspellings in your negative keyword list to cover all bases.



Not Reviewing Search Terms Frequently. Neglecting the Search Terms Report means you could miss irrelevant traffic patterns, leading to wasted spend.




Real-World Example: Success with Negative Keywords



Our local HVAC company was running Google Ads for air conditioning services. Their Search Terms Report revealed clicks from searches like “DIY air conditioner repair.” By adding “DIY” as a negative keyword, we prevented unqualified traffic and reallocated their budget toward users looking for professional services. This simple adjustment led to a 20% reduction in ad spend and a 30% increase in qualified leads.



Takeaways



Negative keywords are an essential tool for maximizing the effectiveness of your Google Ads campaigns. By filtering out irrelevant traffic, you improve CTR, save money, and enhance your Quality Score. Start by analyzing your Search Terms Report, brainstorming potential negatives, and regularly updating your list.

December is here, and you know what that means—holiday music is everywhere! From cozy nights by the fire to shopping marathons, these songs set the perfect mood for the season. For this week’s Music Wednesday, we’re diving into the magic of holiday tunes and sharing some of our all-time favorites.



The Classics We All Love



Let’s be real—what’s the holiday season without Bing Crosby crooning White Christmas or Nat King Cole’s velvety voice in The Christmas Song? These classics are like a warm hug, reminding us of family traditions, twinkling lights, and those feel-good holiday vibes.



We also have to shout out Stevie Wonder’s Someday at Christmas and Willie Nelson’s Pretty Paper. These gems bring a little extra soul and heart to the season, reminding us of what the holidays are really all about.



Newer Songs That Keep the Magic Alive



While we love the oldies, modern holiday music has brought some serious bangers to the mix. Can you even have a holiday party without Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You? (Answer: No, you cannot.) And then there’s Michael Bublé, the modern-day king of holiday music, giving us smooth vibes with tracks like It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas.



Even indie and rock artists have gotten into the holiday spirit. The Killers’ A Great Big Sled and Sufjan Stevens’ dreamy holiday albums show how versatile this genre can be.



What Makes Holiday Music So Special?



Holiday songs have this magic that instantly makes everything feel warm and festive. They’re nostalgic, they’re heartfelt, and they’re a little cheesy in the best way possible. Whether you’re blasting Jingle Bells while decorating the tree or tearing up to Silent Night at a candlelight service, these songs remind us to slow down and soak in the season.



Our Holiday Playlist Picks



If you’re building your holiday playlist, here are some must-haves to get you started:




Stevie Wonder – Someday at Christmas



Willie Nelson – Pretty Paper



Mariah Carey – All I Want for Christmas Is You



Michael Bublé – It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas



Nat King Cole – The Christmas Song



Bing Crosby – White Christmas



The Killers – A Great Big Sled




So, grab your eggnog or hot cocoa, put on your coziest socks, and let the holiday tunes play.

Email marketing is more than just a tool to reach your audience—it’s a way to create personalized experiences that drive engagement and conversions. Behavioral triggers, which are automated emails sent based on a user’s actions (or inactions), are one of the smartest ways to tailor your messaging and increase email marketing ROI.



This blog will guide you through understanding behavioral triggers and how to use them effectively in your email campaigns.



What Are Behavioral Triggers in Email Marketing?



Behavioral triggers are automated email responses activated by specific user behaviors. For example:




Browsing Behavior: Sending product recommendations based on a customer’s website activity.



Purchase Behavior: Thank-you emails or upsell offers post-purchase.



Inactivity: Re-engagement emails for dormant subscribers.




By responding to real-time actions, behavioral triggers create highly relevant, timely messages that feel personal and helpful, not intrusive.



Why Use Behavioral Triggers?




Personalization at Scale: You can craft targeted messages without the manual effort.



Higher Engagement Rates: Triggered emails tend to have higher open and click-through rates because they’re contextually relevant.



Improved Customer Experience: Offering timely solutions or suggestions shows customers you understand their needs.








Types of Behavioral Triggers and How to Use Them




Welcome Emails

Trigger: When someone subscribes to your email list.



Use Case: Introduce your brand, set expectations, and guide them to their next action (e.g., shop now, learn more).



Example: “Thanks for joining us! Here’s a 10% discount to get started.”





Cart Abandonment Emails

Trigger: When a shopper adds items to their cart but doesn’t complete the purchase.



Use Case: Remind them of the items, include a discount or urgency to nudge conversion.



Example: “You left something behind! Complete your purchase today and get 10% off.”





Post-Purchase Emails

Trigger: After a customer completes a purchase.



Use Case: Thank them, suggest complementary products, or ask for feedback.



Example: “Thank you for your order! You might also like these related items.”





Re-Engagement Campaigns

Trigger: When a subscriber hasn’t engaged with your emails for a certain period.



Use Case: Win them back with exclusive offers or new content.



Example: “We miss you! Here’s 20% off to welcome you back.”





Behavior-Based Recommendations

Trigger: Based on website browsing or previous purchases.



Use Case: Suggest products or services tailored to their interests.



Example: “Looking for something similar? Check out these items based on your recent views.”










Best Practices for Behavioral Trigger Emails




Start Small: Begin with one or two triggers, like welcome emails or cart abandonment, before expanding.



Use Clear CTAs: Make it easy for recipients to take the next step.



Test and Optimize: Regularly analyze performance metrics (open rates, click-through rates, conversions) to refine your approach.



Ensure Timeliness: Behavioral emails should be sent quickly to maintain relevance.



Don’t Overwhelm: Avoid sending too many triggered emails; it can feel spammy.




Tools for Setting Up Behavioral Triggers



Popular email marketing platforms like Mailchimp, HubSpot, and Klaviyo make it simple to implement behavioral triggers. These tools offer user-friendly interfaces and pre-built automation workflows to get you started.







Final Thoughts



Behavioral triggers are a game-changer for email marketing, allowing you to deliver personalized, timely, and impactful messages at scale. By understanding your audience’s actions and leveraging automation tools, you can create smarter campaigns that drive engagement, loyalty, and revenue.



Ready to elevate your email strategy? Start implementing behavioral triggers today and watch your results soar!

# What are Brand Assets?

In today's competitive market, having a strong brand is more important than ever. At the core of every successful brand are brand assets—the distinct elements that visually, audibly, and emotionally represent your brand. These assets help set your brand apart from competitors, create consistency across various touchpoints, and leave a lasting impression on consumers.



What Exactly Are Brand Assets?



Brand assets are any recognizable, repeatable elements that contribute to your brand’s identity. When used consistently, they strengthen brand recognition, enhance customer trust, and create emotional connections. Here’s a closer look at the most important brand assets:



1. Logo&nbsp;&nbsp;



Your logo is the face of your brand. It’s often the first thing people see and associate with your business. A well-designed logo is memorable, simple, and scalable—think of the golden arches of McDonald's or Nike’s swoosh.



2. Color Palette



The colors you choose for your brand play a critical role in how your audience perceives you. Colors evoke emotions and create associations. For instance, blue is often linked with trust and professionalism, which is why it’s used by brands like IBM and Facebook. A consistent color scheme across marketing materials, products, and digital platforms solidifies your brand identity.



3. Tagline or Slogan



A catchy, concise tagline or slogan helps your brand communicate its core promise or mission in just a few words. Famous examples like “Just Do It” by Nike or “Think Different” by Apple create a lasting impression and instantly remind consumers of the brand’s values.



4. Typography&nbsp;&nbsp;



Fonts are another visual cue that convey your brand’s personality. The fonts you use in your logo, website, and marketing materials should complement your brand's style. Serif fonts might convey tradition and reliability, while sans-serif fonts give off a modern, clean vibe. Brands like Google and The New York Times use distinct typography that fits their respective personalities.



5. Imagery and Graphics



Photos, illustrations, and graphics should align with your brand’s tone and values. Whether you use minimalist product shots or vibrant lifestyle images, the visuals you choose are crucial to reinforcing your brand's message.



6. Voice and Tone



Beyond the visual elements, your brand’s voice is how you communicate with your audience. Are you formal and professional, or casual and friendly? The tone of your content across social media, emails, and advertising should be consistent to ensure a cohesive brand experience.



7. Sounds and Jingles



Certain brands go even further by incorporating auditory assets, like a sound logo or jingle. Think of Intel’s signature chime or McDonald’s "I'm Lovin' It" jingle. These sounds become synonymous with the brand, creating another layer of recognition.



Why Brand Assets Matter



In a crowded marketplace, standing out is no easy task. Consistent, high-quality brand assets help you do just that by:



1. Building Recognition&nbsp;&nbsp;



When your brand assets are consistent across all platforms, from your website to social media to packaging, they help customers immediately recognize and remember your brand. Whether it's the color of your product packaging or the font on your website, cohesive assets create a unified brand experience.



2. Creating Emotional Connections&nbsp;&nbsp;



Successful brands go beyond recognition—they create emotional connections. By consistently using brand assets that reflect your brand's personality, values, and mission, you build deeper connections with your audience. Whether it’s through a friendly tone or an inspiring tagline, strong brand assets evoke emotions that resonate with customers.



3. Reinforcing Trust



Consistency builds trust. Customers are more likely to trust a brand that presents a unified, professional image. When your logo, colors, voice, and messaging are in harmony, it shows that you are reliable and take your business seriously. A trustworthy brand encourages repeat customers and fosters loyalty.



4. Standing Out from Competitors



Strong brand assets differentiate you from competitors. In industries where many products or services may be similar, it’s your brand assets—like a bold logo or memorable slogan—that will make your business stand out. Unique assets position your brand in the minds of consumers, ensuring you aren’t lost in the sea of competition.



How to Build Strong Brand Assets



Building powerful brand assets requires a strategic approach. Here are a few tips to consider:



1. Understand Your Audience



Your brand assets should speak directly to your target audience. Think about the emotions you want to evoke and the message you want to communicate. Tailoring your assets to resonate with your ideal customers ensures they connect with your brand on a deeper level.



2. Maintain Consistency



Once you’ve established your assets, consistency is key. Ensure all elements—from logos and colors to fonts and tone—are applied uniformly across all platforms. This uniformity helps reinforce your brand’s identity.



3. Adapt as Needed



While consistency is crucial, it’s also important to remain flexible. Brands evolve, and so do their audiences. Periodically review your brand assets to ensure they still align with your brand’s mission and values. Subtle tweaks, such as refreshing a logo or updating a tagline, can help keep your brand current without losing its core identity.



Conclusion



Brand assets are the building blocks of a strong, recognizable brand identity. By investing in well-designed assets and maintaining consistency, you create a cohesive experience that resonates with your audience and stands the test of time. Whether you’re a startup or an established company, cultivating and refining your brand assets is a key strategy for long-term success.

# Seasonal Ad Campaigns: Leveraging Google for Holidays and Events

Seasonal changes and popular holidays mean businesses have a unique opportunity to boost sales and increase brand visibility and targeted Google Ads campaigns are key. Seasonal marketing not only drives customer engagement and conversion but captures the festive, holiday spirit, which we are all about and so is your customer. Let’s leverage those Google Ads for your seasonal campaigns:



1. Identify Key Dates



Start by mapping out the calendar for upcoming holidays and events relevant to your business.&nbsp;




Major holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Valentine’s Day)



Seasonal events (Back to School, Summer Sales)



Local events (festivals, community gatherings)



Niche specific events (if you’re in urban farming, related farming events and meetups)




Understanding your timeline means you can craft campaigns that resonate with your buyer.



2. Create Themed Ad Campaigns



Once you’ve identified key dates, develop themed ad campaigns that align with the holiday spirit. Use festive visuals, language, and promotions to capture attention. For example:




Christmas: Highlight gift ideas, special discounts, or limited-time offers.



Summer: Promote seasonal products or services, like outdoor gear or travel packages.




3. Utilize Seasonal Keywords



Keyword research is crucial for successful Google Ads campaigns. Focus on seasonal keywords that reflect the urgency and relevance of your offerings. Tools like Google Keyword Planner help you find high-traffic keywords associated with the holiday, but keep it genuine and true to your brand. Examples include:




"Last-minute gifts for Christmas"



"Summer sales on outdoor equipment"




Incorporate these keywords into your ad copy and landing pages and improve visibility.



4. Hurry! Implement Countdown Timers



Create a sense of urgency with countdown timers in your ads. Highlight limited-time offers to encourage immediate action. For example, “Only 3 days left to save 20% on your holiday shopping!” Nothing like a light scare tactic to significantly increase click-through rates and conversions.



5. Optimize Those Landing Pages



Ensure your landing pages are tailored to your seasonal campaigns. The messaging, visuals, and calls to action should align with the ad to create a seamless experience. Make it easy for customers to find what they’re looking for, whether it’s a special promotion or a holiday-themed product. No one is out the door faster than a potential customer who can’t find what they’re looking for within seconds.



6. Track Performance and Adjust as Needed



After launching your campaigns, monitor their performance closely. Use Google Ads’ robust analytics tools to track key metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and return on ad spend. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on what’s working and what isn’t. Seasonal trends can shift quickly, so agility is key.



Seasonal campaigns offer a can’t-miss opportunity to engage with customers in a meaningful way. Leveraging Google Ads strategically means businesses can capture the festive spirit and drive significant sales during holidays and events. Thoughtful planning and execution equal seasonal campaigns that become a key driver of success in your overall marketing strategy. 



Happy holidays and happy marketing from all of us at Pixaura!

# How to Optimize Your Website for Voice Search

Why text when you can talk? Voice assistants are changing the way we search and behave in our on-the-go culture. Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are doing the searching for us and voice search is changing the way people access information online. As more users rely on voice commands for their searches, optimizing your website for voice search has become essential for slaying the competition in the competitive digital marketing world. Here’s how you can effectively optimize your website for this emerging trend.



Understanding Voice Search



It changes the words used for searches. Since voice search is allowing users to speak their queries instead of typing, this leads to more conversational phrases and questions, reflecting how we naturally speak. For example, instead of searching for "best pizza near me," a user might ask, "Where can I find the best pizza nearby?"



Why Optimize for Voice Search?




Growing Usage: Voice search is becoming increasingly popular, especially among mobile users. According to recent studies, close to 50% of searches are voice-based.



User Experience: Optimizing for voice search can enhance the overall user experience by making it easier for users to find the information they need quickly and leading them to (and keeping them on) your site.



SEO Advantage: By focusing on voice search, you can gain a competitive edge and improve your visibility in search results. Simply put, when your words match/compliment their words, you get a search results boost.




7 Steps to Optimize Your Website for Voice Search




Focus on Conversational Keywords: Identify and incorporate long-tail keywords that reflect natural speech. Use tools like Google’s Keyword Planner to find phrases that users are likely to voice.



Utilize Question-Based Content: Create content that answers common questions relevant to your audience. Use FAQs, how-to guides, and informative articles that directly respond to user inquiries.



Optimize for Local Search: Many voice searches are location-based. Ensure your business is listed on Google My Business and optimize for local SEO by including location-based keywords and details about your services.



Enhance Page Speed and Mobile-Friendliness: Voice search users often access information on mobile devices, so it’s crucial to have a fast, responsive website. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to analyze and improve your site’s performance.



Create Featured Snippet Content: Aim to have your content featured in Google's answer box. This requires concise, informative answers to common questions, often presented in bullet points or numbered lists. This helps shoot you to the #1 pick for a click.



Optimize Your Website’s FAQ Page: Since many voice searches are question-based, having a dedicated FAQ page can provide direct answers to common queries. This makes it more likely for your site to be featured in voice search results.



Monitor and Analyze Performance: As always, data is key. Use tools like Google Analytics to track how voice search traffic impacts your site. Pay attention to metrics such as bounce rates, page views, and the overall user journey.




The SEO game has a constantly shifting goal line, the trick is staying on top of your game. Pixaura will do that for you.&nbsp;

A robust brand strategy is more crucial than ever in today’s competitive marketplaces. A well-defined brand can set you apart from competitors, resonate with your audience, and foster loyalty. At the heart of this strategy lie your brand pillars—the fundamental beliefs and values that shape your brand's identity. Understanding and implementing these pillars can be the difference between a brand that merely exists and one that thrives.



What Are Brand Pillars?



Brand pillars are the core principles that define a brand's personality and guide its communication and marketing efforts. They serve as the foundation for all brand-related decisions and activities, ensuring consistency across channels and touchpoints. Typically, this include elements such as:




Purpose: The reason your brand exists beyond making a profit. It reflects your brand's commitment to a cause or mission that resonates with your target audience.



Values: The beliefs that guide your brand's actions and decisions. These values should align with those of your audience, fostering a sense of connection and trust.



Vision: A clear picture of what your brand aspires to achieve in the future. Your vision should inspire both your internal team and your customers, serving as a guiding light for your brand's journey.



Differentiation: What sets your brand apart from competitors? Identifying your unique selling propositions (USPs) helps position your brand effectively in the marketplace.



Personality: The human traits associated with your brand. Your brand's personality should be reflected in its tone of voice, messaging, and visual identity, creating a relatable and memorable image.




Why Are Brand Pillars Important?




Consistency: Brand pillars provide a framework for consistent messaging and branding efforts. They help ensure that all communications—whether through social media, advertising, or customer interactions—align with your brand's identity.



Guidance: These pillars act as a compass for decision-making. When faced with choices—be it marketing strategies, partnerships, or product development—referring back to your brand pillars can help you stay true to your core identity.



Connection: By articulating your purpose, values, and vision, you can forge deeper connections with your audience. Consumers are increasingly looking for brands that share their values and align with their beliefs. Strong brand pillars can foster loyalty and advocacy among customers.



Clarity: In a world saturated with messages, clarity is key. Your brand pillars distill your brand's essence into a clear and compelling narrative that is easy for consumers to understand and remember.



Strategic Growth: As your business evolves, your brand pillars can guide your growth strategies. They provide a reference point for assessing new opportunities and ensuring they align with your overall brand vision.




How to Define Your Brand Pillars




Reflect on Your Mission: Start by asking yourself what your brand stands for. What impact do you want to make in the world? Define your mission clearly.



Identify Core Values: List the values that matter most to your brand. Consider how these values align with the needs and preferences of your target audience.



Craft Your Vision: Develop a vision statement that captures your aspirations for the future. Ensure it's inspiring and resonates with your audience.



Analyze Your Competition: Identify what differentiates your brand from others in your industry. Look for gaps in the market that you can fill.



Create a Brand Personality: Think about how you want your brand to be perceived. Use adjectives to describe your brand personality, and ensure your messaging reflects this tone consistently.




Bringing Your Brand to Life



Once you've defined your brand pillars, it’s time to incorporate them into your brand strategy. Here are a few ways to do that:




Messaging: Ensure your marketing messages consistently reflect your brand pillars. Use them as guiding principles for crafting content and campaigns.



Visual Identity: Align your visual branding elements—like logos, colors, and typography—with your brand pillars. This creates a cohesive look and feel that resonates with your audience.



Team Alignment: Share your brand pillars with your team to ensure everyone understands and embodies your brand identity. This alignment will enhance internal culture and external representation.



Customer Experience: Infuse your brand pillars into every customer touchpoint. Whether it’s through customer service, social media interactions, or product offerings, make sure your pillars shine through.




Takeaways



Brand pillars are essential to creating a strong, cohesive message that resonates with your audience. By clearly defining and implementing these pillars in your brand strategy, you can build trust, loyalty, and a lasting connection with your customers. At Pixaura, we understand the importance of a solid brand foundation. Let us help you discover and amplify your brand pillars to elevate your brand strategy and drive success in the marketplace.

# What is CHERP Optimization?

Full Content:
In the evolving landscape of search and digital marketing, a new strategy is gaining importance: optimizing your website for AI-generated results. With AI chatbots becoming integral to how users seek information, ensuring your website ranks well in these bot-generated results is essential for maintaining visibility and driving traffic. This is where a new approach—let’s call it "CHERP Optimization"—comes into play. Similar to traditional SEO, it involves fine-tuning your website content to ensure representation and priority in AI-driven search responses.



The Rise of CHERP



As AI bots like ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Google Bard become more common in everyday queries, businesses must now ensure their website is present in the AI-generated results AND stands out among competitors. Unlike traditional search results, AI-generated responses are often limited in scope and focus on delivering concise, relevant answers. Optimizing for this format means ensuring your website offers clear, direct, and relevant information that AI can easily pull from.



Key Elements of CHERP Optimization




Relevance: Just like with traditional SEO, relevance is king. To show up in AI-generated responses, your content must directly answer user queries and match the AI’s intent. Focus on clear, authoritative content that addresses specific user needs.



Clarity: AI bots prioritize content that’s straightforward and easy to digest. Ensure your messaging is clear and concise. Simplifying complex topics and avoiding jargon can make it easier for AI to summarize or extract key points.



Authority: Building your website’s authority through high-quality backlinks and expertise signals remains vital. AI tends to pull from trusted sources. Focus on creating content that positions your site as a subject-matter authority can boost inclusion in bot results.



Structure: Well-structured content, such as FAQ pages or well-organized blog posts, can help AI quickly identify relevant information. Use headers, bullet points, and short paragraphs to make your content easier to scan and interpret.



Schema Markup: Leveraging structured data or schema markup helps AI understand your website’s content more accurately. Implementing schema for articles, products, or FAQs can increase the likelihood that bots will pull data from your site.




Why CHERP Optimization Matters



As more users turn to AI bots for quick answers, inclusion in those responses is crucial for staying competitive. CHERP optimization can directly impact your brand’s visibility, user engagement, and overall success.




Increased Visibility: As AI bots play a larger role in delivering search results, optimizing for CHERPs ensures your website is not left out of this growing channel.



Enhanced User Experience: Providing clear, relevant answers to users’ queries improves their overall experience, making it more likely they’ll visit your site for further information.



Improved Conversions: By guiding AI bots to prioritize your site in relevant queries, you increase the chances of users engaging with your brand, leading to higher conversions.




How to Implement CHERP Optimization




Audit Current Content: Review your website to ensure it answers common user questions in a clear, structured way. Focus on topics relevant to your audience and tailor them to the types of queries AI bots receive.



Optimize for Natural Language: Since AI bots use natural language processing (NLP), your content should mirror how users ask questions. Incorporate conversational phrases, long-tail keywords, and question-based headers that align with the way people search.



Build Credibility: Establish your website as a trusted resource by earning backlinks from reputable sites, publishing expert content, and engaging in online discussions that demonstrate your expertise in your industry.



Implement Structured Data: Use schema markup to enhance the way AI interprets your content. This helps ensure that specific, structured data (like addresses, product details, or event dates) is pulled directly into bot responses.




Are You Optimized?



As AI bots transform how users retrieve information, optimizing your website for AI-generated results is an essential strategy. By focusing on relevance, clarity, authority, structure, and schema markup, you can ensure your site remains visible in this new AI-driven search landscape. Implementing CHERP optimization will not only boost your chances of inclusion in chatbot responses but also improve your digital presence overall.

In today’s competitive market, understanding your audience is key to delivering personalized and effective marketing campaigns. One of the best tools to achieve this understanding is customer personas. These fictional representations of your ideal customers help you focus your efforts, align messaging, and create strategies that resonate with real people. In this blog, we’ll explore what customer personas are, why they’re essential, and how to create them for your marketing strategy.



What Are Customer Personas?



Customer personas, also known as buyer personas, are detailed profiles that represent different segments of your target audience. Rather than focusing on broad demographics, personas dive deeper into behaviors, motivations, pain points, and goals.



A well-crafted persona typically includes:




Name (fictional but humanizing)



Age range



Occupation



Location



Income level



Challenges and pain points



Goals and motivations



Preferred communication channels




For example, if you’re a digital marketing agency, one persona could be "Samantha," a 35-year-old small business owner looking for affordable marketing strategies to grow her brand.



Why Are Customer Personas Important?




Personalization and Relevance: Today’s consumers expect more than one-size-fits-all solutions. Customer personas help personalize your marketing efforts by tailoring messages to specific needs and concerns. For instance, a small business owner may respond better to affordable marketing tips, while a C-suite executive might prioritize ROI and growth potential. The more relevant your messaging, the more likely you are to engage your audience.



Targeted Content Creation: Personas allow you to create content that resonates with your audience’s unique interests. Whether it's blog posts, social media content, or email campaigns, having a clear understanding of what motivates your audience helps you develop topics that capture their attention. For example, if your persona struggles with understanding social media analytics, you could create a guide on measuring ROI on digital campaigns.



Effective Ad Campaigns: When running paid ads, defining the audience is crucial. With customer personas, you can narrow down your ad targeting to those who are most likely to convert. A persona-based approach enables you to choose the right platforms and ad messaging, reducing wasted spend and boosting ROI.



Product or Service Development: Understanding your audience’s pain points and needs doesn’t just help with marketing—it also guides product or service development. By aligning your offerings with what your personas are looking for, you ensure that you're creating something that solves real problems, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.




How to Create Customer Personas



Building customer personas involves a mix of research, data analysis, and creativity. Here's how you can start:




Gather Data: Start with any data you have available—customer surveys, CRM insights, web analytics, and social media data. Analyze patterns such as purchasing behavior, demographics, and common pain points.&nbsp;



Conduct Interviews: Reach out to current customers, prospects, and even lost leads to understand their motivations and challenges. Ask questions about their decision-making processes, the problems they’re trying to solve, and what led them to your company (or away from it).&nbsp;



Segment Your Audience: Group your findings into different segments. For example, a persona could represent a budget-conscious startup owner, while another might focus on a tech-savvy marketing executive with more disposable income.&nbsp;



Create Persona Profiles: Using the information you've gathered, create detailed profiles for each persona. Give them names, faces, and backstories to humanize them. Include their goals, pain points, the solutions they seek, and their preferred communication methods.&nbsp;



Refine Over Time: Customer personas are not static; they evolve as your business and audience grow. Regularly revisit your personas and adjust them based on new data, trends, and feedback to ensure they remain relevant and useful.




How to Use Customer Personas in Your Marketing Strategy



Once you’ve created your personas, it's time to integrate them into your marketing strategy:




Content Strategy: Use personas to create targeted blog posts, videos, and social media updates that speak directly to the needs of each segment.&nbsp;



Email Campaigns: Personalize email content, subject lines, and offers based on the interests and behaviors of your personas.



Social Media Ads: Target your social media campaigns based on persona preferences, ensuring the right people see your ads at the right time.



Customer Journey Mapping: Develop customer journeys for each persona to understand how they interact with your brand at every stage, from awareness to conversion.




Conclusion



Customer personas are more than just marketing tools; they are the foundation for delivering personalized, targeted, and effective campaigns. By taking the time to research, develop, and refine your personas, you’ll create marketing strategies that truly resonate with your audience, leading to better engagement, higher conversion rates, and stronger brand loyalty.

# The Art of Compelling Content

In the digital age, content is not just king, it's the entire kingdom. Captivating users, building trust, driving engagement, it all hinges on content. High-quality, compelling content is both an art and a science — here’s how you can master the craft and ensure your content resonates with your audience.



1. Know Your Audience



Before you start creating content, it’s crucial to understand who you’re speaking to. Developing detailed buyer personas allows you to tailor your content to the specific needs, interests, and pain points of your target audience. Conduct market research, analyze customer feedback, and leverage analytics to gain insights into what your audience values most.



2. Start with a Strong Strategy



A well-defined strategy serves as the blueprint for your content creation efforts. Outline your goals, identify key themes, and establish a content calendar. Decide on the types of content you’ll produce—whether it’s blog posts, videos, infographics, or social media updates—and determine how each piece will support your broader marketing objectives.



3. Create Value-Driven Content



To captivate your audience, your content must provide real value. Focus on solving problems, answering questions, or offering insights that your audience finds useful and relevant. Whether it’s through educational blog posts, actionable tips, or in-depth industry analysis, make sure your content is designed to enrich the lives of your readers.



4. Craft Attention-Grabbing Headlines



Your headline is the first thing your audience sees, so make it count. A compelling headline grabs attention and entices readers to click through. Use powerful language, incorporate numbers or statistics, and ensure your headline clearly communicates the benefit or value of the content. A great headline can significantly increase your content’s visibility and engagement.



5. Tell a Story



Humans are naturally drawn to stories. Weaving a narrative into your content can make it more relatable and memorable. Share real-life examples, case studies, or personal anecdotes to illustrate your points. Storytelling helps build an emotional connection with your audience and makes your content more engaging.



6. Use Visuals to Enhance Your Message



Visual content such as images, videos, and infographics can significantly enhance your message and make your content more engaging. Visuals help break up text, illustrate complex concepts, and capture attention. Ensure your visuals are high-quality, relevant, and aligned with your brand’s aesthetic.



7. Optimize for SEO



Search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial for ensuring your content is discoverable by your target audience. Incorporate relevant keywords naturally, optimize meta descriptions, and use alt text for images. Additionally, structure your content with headers and bullet points to improve readability and enhance your chances of ranking higher in search engine results. Don’t try to beat the algorithm, though. Search engines are looking for authenticity. Creating rich and valuable content is your greatest attack plan here.



8. Engage and Interact



Content is not a one-way street. Encourage interaction by inviting readers to comment, share their thoughts, or ask questions. Engaging with your audience through comments and social media interactions fosters a sense of community and helps build stronger relationships with your brand.



9. Analyze and Iterate



Creating compelling content is an ongoing process. Regularly analyze the performance of your content to understand what resonates with your audience and what doesn’t. Use metrics such as engagement rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates to measure success. Based on your findings, adjust your strategy and refine your content to continuously improve.



Pixaura specializes in creating compelling content tailored to a unique brand and audience and all the services that go with it. From genius copy to account management, we will tell your story and achieve your marketing goals.&nbsp;

# Is AI Theft? Exploring the Ethical Dilemma of AI in Creative Industries

Full Content:
As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into creative industries, a debate is brewing: Is AI theft? From generating artwork to writing content, AI’s ability to mimic and even enhance human creativity has raised ethical concerns.&nbsp;



At the heart of this conversation lies a crucial question: Are AI tools unfairly benefiting from the work of human creators without due compensation or recognition?



Understanding AI’s Creative Process



AI systems, especially in the creative fields like writing, design, and music, are trained on vast amounts of data. This data often includes works created by humans—be it text, images, or sounds. Machine learning models like GPT (natural language processing) or GANs (image generation) learn patterns from this data to generate new outputs.



The key point of contention is how AI accesses this data. Many argue that AI models do not create original work but rather remix and repurpose existing human creations. If AI tools are trained on a massive database of human work, should this be considered a form of theft?



The Case for AI Theft



Some creators believe that AI's ability to replicate and generate work based on existing content is tantamount to theft. This argument hinges on the idea that AI tools are profiting from human creativity without giving back. For example, artists, writers, and musicians may feel that their work is training AI without consent or compensation.



Here are a few core arguments in favor of this perspective:




Unlicensed Use of Content: Many AI systems are trained on publicly available data, which may include copyrighted material. Creators argue that using their work in AI training without permission is akin to unauthorized use.



Devaluing Human Labor: AI-generated content can be produced quickly and cheaply, which might undermine the value of human-created work. This has raised concerns about job displacement and fair compensation in creative industries.



Erosion of Intellectual Property Rights: If AI-generated works are derivative of human creations, there’s a growing fear that intellectual property rights might become blurred, complicating ownership disputes.




The Case Against AI Theft



On the flip side, proponents of AI argue that the technology is merely a tool, not a thief. AI enthusiasts suggest that AI functions similarly to how human beings learn: by absorbing information and drawing inspiration from a variety of sources. This learning process, they argue, is not inherently theft—rather, it’s a form of collective knowledge-building.



Supporters of AI-driven creativity offer the following counterpoints:




Fair Use and Transformation: AI can be seen as operating under the principle of fair use, particularly when it generates transformative content. Rather than copying existing works, AI can reimagine and recontextualize them in new ways.



Augmentation, Not Replacement: AI tools are often used to assist human creators, not replace them. These tools can automate repetitive tasks or inspire new ideas, allowing artists and writers to focus on higher-level creative decisions.



Innovation and Accessibility: AI democratizes creativity by giving more people the ability to produce content, even if they lack traditional skills in writing, art, or music. This can lead to new forms of innovation that benefit society as a whole.




Legal and Ethical Complexities



The legal landscape surrounding AI and intellectual property is still in its infancy. While there have been lawsuits related to AI-generated content and copyright infringement, courts have yet to fully address whether AI-generated work constitutes theft or whether current copyright laws can adequately protect creators in an AI-driven world.



Some legal experts argue that new frameworks may be necessary to navigate this evolving field. For example, should creators receive royalties if their work is used to train AI systems? Or should AI-generated content have its own copyright protections, distinct from human-generated work?



Conclusion? It’s A Gray Area



The question of whether AI is theft doesn’t have a simple answer. While AI undoubtedly relies on human creations for its outputs, its role as either a tool or a threat depends largely on the ethical, legal, and commercial framework in place.



For now, the challenge lies in striking a balance between fostering innovation through AI while protecting and compensating ensuring that human creators for their work. As AI continues to reshape the creative landscape, industries will need to establish clear guidelines that address the rights and responsibilities of both AI developers and the creators whose work they rely on. 



Whether or not AI is theft may ultimately depend on how society chooses to regulate, compensate, and ethically engage with this rapidly evolving technology.

In today's complex digital landscape, customers interact with brands across multiple channels and touchpoints before making a purchase. This can make it challenging to understand which efforts are driving conversions. Multi-source attribution in Google conversion tracking provides a solution by offering insights into the customer journey and highlighting the value of each marketing touchpoint.&nbsp;



What is Multi-Source Attribution?



Multi-source attribution, also known as multi-channel attribution, is the process of assigning credit to various marketing touchpoints that contribute to a conversion. Unlike single-source attribution models, which give all credit to one touchpoint (e.g., last click or first click), multi-source attribution recognizes that multiple interactions across different channels contribute to a customer's decision to convert.



Why is Multi-Source Attribution Important?




Holistic View of Customer Journey: By understanding all the touchpoints a customer interacts with, marketers can gain a comprehensive view of the customer journey and identify key influences on conversion.



Improved Marketing ROI: Allocating budget and resources to the most effective channels and touchpoints ensures better ROI. Multi-source attribution helps identify these high-performing areas.



Informed Decision-Making: With accurate attribution data, marketers can make data-driven decisions to optimize their strategies, campaigns, and overall marketing mix.



Enhanced Customer Experience: Understanding how different channels and interactions influence customers allows for more personalized and effective marketing efforts, leading to a better customer experience.




Types of Multi-Source Attribution Models




Linear Attribution: Each touchpoint in the conversion path is given equal credit. This model is simple and provides a straightforward way to understand the impact of each touchpoint.



Time Decay Attribution: Touchpoints closer to the conversion receive more credit. This model is useful for campaigns with a short sales cycle or when recent interactions are more influential.



Position-Based Attribution: Assigns 40% credit to the first and last interactions and distributes the remaining 20% evenly among the middle touchpoints. This model highlights the importance of initial engagement and the final push to conversion.



Data-Driven Attribution: Uses machine learning to distribute credit based on how touchpoints impact conversion. This model requires sufficient data and is available in Google Ads for accounts with a significant amount of conversion data.




How to Implement Multi-Source Attribution




Set Up Conversion Tracking: Ensure that conversion tracking is properly set up in Google Ads or Google Analytics. Define the key conversions you want to track, such as purchases, sign-ups, or form submissions.



Choose an Attribution Model: Select the attribution model that aligns with your business goals and customer journey. In Google Ads, you can choose from various models, including last click, first click, linear, time decay, position-based, and data-driven.



Analyze Attribution Reports: Utilize Google Ads or Google Analytics attribution reports to analyze how different touchpoints contribute to conversions. Pay attention to metrics like assisted conversions, which highlight the supporting role of various interactions.



Optimize Your Campaigns: Use the insights from your attribution analysis to optimize your marketing efforts. Allocate budget to high-performing channels, refine your messaging, and experiment with different strategies to improve conversion rates.



Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment: Multi-source attribution is not a one-time setup. Continuously monitor your attribution data, adjust your strategies, and refine your campaigns based on the insights you gain.




Best Practices for Multi-Source Attribution




Align Attribution with Business Goals: Choose an attribution model that best reflects your business objectives and the nature of your customer journey.



Ensure Data Accuracy: Accurate data is crucial for effective attribution. Regularly check your tracking setup to ensure it captures all relevant touchpoints.



Integrate Cross-Channel Data: Combine data from various marketing platforms to get a complete picture of your customer journey. Tools like Google Analytics 360 and CRM systems can help integrate cross-channel data.



Educate Your Team: Ensure that your marketing team understands the importance of multi-source attribution and how to interpret attribution reports. This knowledge will enable them to make informed decisions.



Stay Updated: The digital marketing landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed about new attribution models, tools, and best practices to keep your strategies current and effective.




Takeaways



Multi-source attribution is a powerful tool for understanding and optimizing the customer journey. By accurately attributing credit to various touchpoints, businesses can make data-driven decisions, improve marketing ROI, and enhance the customer experience. Implementing and continuously refining your attribution strategy in Google conversion tracking will help you stay ahead in the competitive digital landscape.

# Dark Patterns: 7 Deceptive Design Practices

Full Content:
In the world of digital marketing, user experience (UX) design plays a crucial role in guiding users through websites and applications. While most design practices aim to enhance usability and satisfaction, some employ deceptive tactics known as "dark patterns." These are manipulative design choices that trick users into taking actions they might not otherwise take. Here, we explore seven of the most common dark patterns.



1. Bait-and-Switch



The bait-and-switch tactic involves enticing users with an attractive offer or option, only to switch it with something less favorable once they engage. This deceptive practice is akin to a classic retail scam but occurs in the digital realm. For example, a user might click on a banner advertising a free service, only to be redirected to a page requiring payment or sign-up for a different product.



2. Confirmshaming



Confirmshaming leverages guilt or shame to compel users into making a decision. This tactic often appears in the form of pop-ups or messages that pressure users into subscribing to newsletters or accepting terms. Phrases like "No, I don't want to save money" or "No, I prefer paying full price" make users feel bad about opting out, pushing them towards the desired action.



3. Roach Motels



Roach motels describe scenarios where users easily get into a certain situation but find it extremely difficult to get out. Common examples include subscription services or memberships that are simple to sign up for but complex to cancel. Companies use this tactic to retain customers longer than they might want, benefiting from recurring payments.



4. Preselection



Preselection involves automatically selecting options that benefit the company rather than the user. This tactic is prevalent in online shopping, where additional items or services are pre-checked in the cart, leading to increased sales. Users may not notice these selections and end up purchasing more than they intended.



5. Disguised Ads



Disguised ads blend advertisements seamlessly into the content, making it hard for users to distinguish between genuine content and paid promotions. Native advertising, where ads mimic the style and format of editorial content, is a prime example. This can mislead users into engaging with ads thinking they are part of the regular content.



6. Hidden Costs



Hidden costs refer to additional charges that are not disclosed upfront but appear during the final stages of a transaction. This tactic can lead to user frustration and abandonment of the purchase process. Examples include unexpected shipping fees, taxes, or service charges that are revealed just before the payment step.



7. Privacy Zuckering



Privacy zuckering, named after Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, involves tricking users into sharing more personal information than they intended. This can be achieved through confusing privacy settings, pre-checked consent boxes, or misleading information about data usage. Users might unknowingly grant permissions that compromise their privacy.



Combating Dark Patterns



Understanding dark patterns is crucial for both users and ethical marketers. Users should remain vigilant and question unexpected or confusing elements in their digital interactions. Ethical marketers, on the other hand, should strive for transparency and user-centric design practices that build trust and long-term loyalty.



Prioritizing ethical design over deceptive practices not only fosters a positive user experience but also enhances brand reputation and customer retention. By avoiding dark patterns, marketers can ensure they build genuine relationships with their audience, leading to sustainable success.

For more than half a century, the Rolling Stones have defined the essence of rock 'n' roll. Formed in London in 1962, the band has not only stood the test of time but has also continuously evolved, influencing countless artists and genres along the way. Let's look at their remarkable journey, their enduring impact on music, and what makes the band a timeless musical icon.



The Early Years



The story of the Rolling Stones begins with childhood friends Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, who bonded over their love for blues and rock music. Along with Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman, they formed a band that would soon take the world by storm. Their self-titled debut album, released in 1964, featured a mix of blues covers and original songs, setting the stage for their unique sound and rebellious image.



Breaking Boundaries



Throughout the 1960s, the Rolling Stones pushed the boundaries of rock music with a string of groundbreaking albums, including "Aftermath" (1966), "Beggars Banquet" (1968), and "Let It Bleed" (1969). These albums showcased their ability to blend various musical styles, from blues and rock to country and psychedelia. The 1969 release of "Let It Bleed" featured the iconic song "Gimme Shelter," a powerful anthem reflecting the tumultuous times.



The Golden Era



The early 1970s saw the Rolling Stones at the height of their creative powers. Albums like "Sticky Fingers" (1971) and "Exile on Main St." (1972) are considered some of the greatest rock records ever made. With hits like "Brown Sugar," "Wild Horses," and "Tumbling Dice," the band solidified their status as rock legends. Their live performances, characterized by Jagger’s charismatic stage presence and Richards’ gritty guitar riffs, became the stuff of legend.



Enduring Through Changes



The 1980s and 1990s brought both challenges and triumphs for the Rolling Stones. The band faced lineup changes, personal conflicts, and the ever-evolving music industry. Despite these hurdles, they continued to release successful albums, such as "Tattoo You" (1981) and "Steel Wheels" (1989), and embarked on massive world tours that captivated audiences across generations.



The Rolling Stones Today



Even after more than 60 years, the Rolling Stones show no signs of slowing down. Their most recent album, "Blue &amp; Lonesome" (2016), returned to their blues roots and received critical acclaim. The band's ability to stay relevant in an ever-changing landscape is a testament to their talent, resilience, and unrelenting passion.



Influence and Legacy



The Rolling Stones’ influence on rock music is immeasurable. They have inspired countless artists, from punk rockers to modern indie bands. Their rebellious spirit, innovative sound, and iconic imagery have left an indelible mark on popular culture. Songs like "Paint It Black," "Sympathy for the Devil," and "Start Me Up" continue to resonate with new generations of fans, proving that their music is truly timeless.



Conclusion



The Rolling Stones are more than just a band; they are a cultural phenomenon. Their journey from the blues clubs of London to the world’s biggest stadiums is a story of perseverance, innovation, and unbridled rock 'n' roll spirit. As they continue to tour and create new music, the Rolling Stones remain a powerful reminder of the enduring power of rock 'n' roll. Their legacy is not just in the past but also in the present and future, as they inspire future generations to pick up a guitar, write a song, and keep the spirit of rock alive.

Pixaura fully embraces and celebrates the diverse types of marketers that fuel our well-oiled machine of creativity and success, making it both run and soar. Let’s look at some of the players:



The Communicator



This person thrives on making words work. Nailing the right tone, pacing and voice for every circumstance is ultimate satisfaction. Weaving words is their art — they take your lightly-hinted need and grow it into a niche approach to make magic happen.



The Creative



Give them a problem and a box won’t touch them as they soar through the universe of their own otherworldly ideas. Ideas explode from their imagination as they create distinctive solutions that fit like a puzzle piece in the marketing riddle. They piece together approaches in novel ways, and the result is a spellbinding approach you never saw coming.



The Manager



Every creative needs a left-brained superhero in their corner. The manager makes art out of tasks, delegating and monitoring to tame the magic into productivity. Communication, kindness and the art of organization are their superpowers.



The Strategist



Marketing is a game they can’t wait to play. Results, scores and numbers are their reward; winning the marketing game is how they thrive. Trust the strategist to rock the analytics — this is where they light up like the sun. 



The Soldier



When websites go wonky or online trolls unite, the soldier works endlessly to set things right. They see dedication and the grindstone as a place of satisfaction, feeling settled only when everything is right in the digital world once more.



The Connector



Meeting and reaching the consciousness of the consumer is where this marketer lives — and what they love. It’s not just a series of tasks, but an exercise in true connection. The best marketing campaigns are the ones that reach out and genuinely connect to another in sincerity. The connector lives in this sphere of pure happiness, outputting what is often the most successful marketing campaign.



Takeaways



Each approach and strength adds to the value of our team as a whole and means you’re getting every strength when you work with us. At Pixaura, the strength is in the team.

Marketing is a double-edged sword. When done right, it can catapult a brand to unprecedented heights. But when it goes wrong, the fallout can be spectacular—and costly. In part one of this series, we discussed the common reasons marketing campaigns fail. Today, we're exploring some of the biggest marketing fails on record, and the invaluable lessons they teach us about the perils of misjudgment and oversight in marketing.



1. Pepsi’s Kendall Jenner Ad (2017)




The Campaign: Pepsi released an ad featuring Kendall Jenner, portraying her as a unifying figure in a social justice protest. The ad implied that handing a police officer a can of Pepsi could resolve tensions between protesters and law enforcement.



The Fallout: The ad was widely criticized for trivializing social justice movements and being tone-deaf. It faced backlash on social media and was pulled within 24 hours.



The Lesson: Cultural sensitivity and awareness are crucial. Brands must understand the gravity of social issues and avoid simplifying or commodifying them for commercial purposes.




2. Heinz QR Code Mishap (2015)




The Campaign: Heinz ran a promotion in Germany where customers could scan a QR code on ketchup bottles to design their own labels. 



The Fallout: After the promotion ended, the QR code redirected users to a pornographic website because the domain had expired and was purchased by a third party.



The Lesson: Regularly review and update all digital assets, including QR codes and URLs. Ensure that domains remain under company control to avoid misdirection and potential brand damage.




3. New Coke (1985)




The Campaign: Coca-Cola introduced a new formula for its flagship drink, aiming to compete with Pepsi's sweeter taste. 



The Fallout: Consumers were outraged, leading to a massive backlash. Coca-Cola reintroduced the original formula as "Coca-Cola Classic" within three months.



The Lesson: Understand and respect customer loyalty. Radical changes to beloved products can alienate core customers. Always consider the emotional connection consumers have with your brand.




4. Burger King’s International Women’s Day Tweet (2021)




The Campaign: On International Women’s Day, Burger King UK tweeted, "Women belong in the kitchen," intending to highlight the underrepresentation of women in the culinary industry and promote a scholarship program.



The Fallout: The tweet was seen as sexist and received immediate backlash. Despite attempts to clarify, the damage was done, and Burger King had to issue apologies and delete the tweet.



The Lesson: Context and phrasing matter immensely, especially on sensitive topics. Messages should be clear and not open to misinterpretation. Consider potential reactions and ensure the intent is immediately apparent.




5. Gap’s Logo Redesign (2010)




The Campaign: Gap unveiled a new logo in an attempt to modernize its brand image.



The Fallout: The new design was met with widespread criticism and mockery. Consumers preferred the classic logo, leading Gap to revert to the original within a week.



The Lesson: Brand identity is precious. Major changes should be approached with caution and ideally tested with focus groups or loyal customers before a full rollout. Consistency can be more valuable than modernity.




6. Hoover’s Free Flights Promotion (1992)




The Campaign: Hoover UK offered free round-trip tickets to Europe or the U.S. with any purchase over £100.



The Fallout: The promotion led to a surge in sales of low-cost vacuum cleaners, with many consumers only interested in the flights. The company couldn’t afford to honor all the tickets, resulting in financial losses and a damaged reputation.



The Lesson: Promotions should be financially viable and consider potential consumer responses. Overly generous offers can lead to unforeseen demand and logistical challenges, potentially crippling the business.




Takeaways



These marketing fails underscore the importance of thorough planning, cultural sensitivity, customer understanding, and the ability to anticipate potential pitfalls. While innovation and boldness are essential in marketing, they must be balanced with caution and insight. By learning from these missteps, marketers can better navigate the complex landscape of brand communication and maintain their reputation even in the face of adversity.

# Mastering Email Marketing for Customer Retention

Email marketing is one of the most effective tools for businesses looking to retain customers. Unlike acquisition marketing, which focuses on attracting new customers, retention marketing aims to engage and nurture existing customers to encourage repeat business. 



Numerous studies have shown that keeping a customer costs 4-5 times less than acquiring a new one! Here’s how you can leverage email marketing to enhance customer retention and build long-lasting relationships with your customers.



1. Understand Your Audience



The first step in creating an effective email marketing strategy is to understand your audience. Collect data on customer preferences, behaviors, and purchase history. Use this information to segment your email list and create targeted campaigns that resonate with different segments of your audience.




Use signup forms to gather relevant customer information.



Analyze past purchase data to identify patterns and preferences.



Segment your email list based on demographics, purchase history, and engagement levels.




2. Personalize Your Emails



Personalization goes beyond addressing the customer by their first name. Tailor your content to meet the specific needs and interests of each customer. Personalized emails show customers that you value them as individuals, which can significantly boost engagement and retention.




Use dynamic content to show different images or offers based on customer segments.



Send personalized recommendations based on past purchases or browsing behavior.



Celebrate milestones like birthdays or anniversaries with special offers.




3. Create Valuable Content



Your emails should provide value to your customers. This could be in the form of exclusive discounts, informative content, or early access to new products. The goal is to make your emails something that customers look forward to receiving.




Offer exclusive deals and discounts to email subscribers.



Share educational content, such as how-to guides or industry news.



Provide early access to sales or new product launches.




4. Implement a Loyalty Program



Loyalty programs are a great way to reward repeat customers and encourage continued engagement. Use your email marketing to promote your loyalty program, update customers on their status, and remind them of the benefits they can earn.




Send regular updates on loyalty points or rewards status.



Highlight exclusive benefits for loyalty program members.



Use gamification to make the loyalty program more engaging.




5. Automate Your Email Campaigns



Automation allows you to send timely, relevant emails without manual intervention. Set up automated workflows to nurture customers at different stages of their journey, from welcome emails to re-engagement campaigns for inactive customers.




Create a welcome series for new subscribers.



Set up automated re-engagement campaigns for inactive customers.



Use trigger-based emails for specific actions, such as cart abandonment or post-purchase follow-ups.




6. Gather Feedback and Iterate



Continuous improvement is key to a successful email marketing strategy. Regularly gather feedback from your customers and analyze email performance metrics to identify areas for improvement. Use this data to refine your campaigns and better meet your customers' needs.




Send surveys to gather customer feedback.



Analyze open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates to measure success.



A/B test different email elements, such as subject lines, images, and calls to action.




7. Monitor and Optimize Deliverability



Even the best email content is useless if it doesn’t reach your customers’ inboxes. Monitor your email deliverability and take steps to maintain a healthy sender reputation. This includes avoiding spammy language, ensuring your email list is clean, and complying with email marketing regulations.




Regularly clean your email list to remove inactive subscribers.



Avoid using words and phrases that trigger spam filters.



Ensure your emails are mobile-friendly and load quickly.




Takeaways



Email marketing is a powerful tool for customer retention when used strategically. By understanding your audience, personalizing your content, providing value, leveraging automation, and continuously optimizing your approach, you can build stronger relationships with your customers and encourage long-term loyalty. Start implementing these strategies today and watch your customer retention rates soar.

In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, staying on top of search engine algorithm updates is crucial for success. Recently, the SEO community has been abuzz with discussions about some significant leaks from Google, providing insights into the inner workings of its search algorithms. While much of the information is highly technical, there are several revelations that impact everyone with SEO strategy.



The Leaks: A Brief Overview



Recently, several documents and insider information have surfaced that shed light on various aspects of Google’s search algorithms. These leaks, though not officially confirmed by Google, have been analyzed and discussed extensively by SEO experts. The key takeaways from these leaks include:



1. Content Quality and Relevance



Google continues to prioritize high-quality, relevant content. The leaked information reaffirms that the search engine giant’s primary goal is to provide users with the best possible answers to their queries. This means that content that is well-researched, informative, and up-to-date is more likely to rank higher.



2. E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)



The concept of E-A-T has been emphasized even more in the leaked documents. Google’s algorithms are designed to favor content that demonstrates expertise, authority, and trustworthiness. This highlights the importance of having credible sources and expert authors for your content.



3. User Experience (UX)



User experience factors, such as page load speed, mobile-friendliness, and easy navigation, continue to play a significant role in rankings. The leaks suggest that Google is becoming even more sophisticated in assessing UX, which means websites need to cater to both desktop and mobile users.



4. Backlinks and Link Quality



While the importance of backlinks is well-known, the leaks indicate that the quality of these links is under more scrutiny than ever. Google’s algorithms are getting better at distinguishing between high-quality, relevant backlinks and spammy, low-quality ones.



Takeaways



The recent Google SEO leaks offer valuable insights that can help digital marketers refine their strategies and stay competitive. At Pixaura, we are leveraging this information to take our SEO strategies to the next level and ensure our clients stay ahead of the curve. Our SEO team is continuously refining our tactics to align with Google's evolving algorithms and delivering outstanding results for our clients.

Is Google Hurting Businesses? How Search Updates Impact Traffic



The recent Google core update, codenamed "Zero," and ongoing improvements to Google Search are causing concern for businesses. While the aim is to provide users with the most helpful and trustworthy information, some companies are experiencing significant drops in search traffic.



The Problem:




Google Zero prioritizes "people-first" content, focusing on expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T). This can disadvantage smaller businesses or niche websites who may have valuable content but lack a large online presence.



Google is increasingly using features like knowledge panels and direct answers within the search results page, reducing the need for users to click on external links. This can bypass websites entirely, even if they rank highly.




The Impact:




Companies are reporting decreased website traffic, potentially harming their online visibility and sales.



Reliance on search engines for traffic can be risky, as businesses have limited control over Google's algorithms.




What Businesses Can Do:




Focus on creating high-quality, informative content that genuinely helps users.



Build expertise and authority in their niche by establishing themselves as a trusted source.



Diversify marketing strategies beyond just search engine optimization (SEO) to reach customers through social media, email marketing, or influencer partnerships.



Stay updated on Google's algorithm changes and adapt SEO strategies accordingly.




Is There a Solution?




Open communication between Google and businesses would be beneficial.



Businesses need to adapt to the changing search landscape by prioritizing user experience and building trust with their audience.



Businesses need a full spectrum approach to marketing. Don't just rely on Google for your traffic!




Conclusion



While Google's goal of a better user experience is admirable, some businesses are feeling the pinch. By focusing on high-quality content, building expertise, and diversifying marketing efforts, companies can navigate these changes and maintain a strong online presence.

Full Content:
In digital marketing, tracking the effectiveness of your campaigns is crucial. One powerful tool that marketers use to achieve this is UTM parameters. These simple tags added to the end of URLs allow you to track the performance of campaigns with precision. In this blog, we'll delve into what UTM parameters are, why they are important, how to create them, and best practices for their use.



What Are UTM Parameters?



UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) parameters are tags that you can add to the URLs of your marketing or promotional campaigns. These parameters are used by Google Analytics and other analytics tools to track the performance of campaigns, allowing you to see where your traffic is coming from and how it is interacting with your website.



The Five UTM Parameters




utm_source: Identifies the source of the traffic, such as a search engine, newsletter, or social media platform (e.g., utm_source=google).



utm_medium: Describes the medium used to share the link, like email, CPC (cost-per-click), or social (e.g., utm_medium=email).



utm_campaign: Names the specific campaign, which can help you distinguish between different marketing efforts (e.g., utm_campaign=spring_sale).



utm_term: Tracks specific keywords for paid search campaigns (e.g., utm_term=spring_shoes).



utm_content: Differentiates between similar content or links within the same ad, useful for A/B testing (e.g., utm_content=header_link).




Why UTM Parameters Are Important




Detailed Tracking: They allow you to track the effectiveness of individual campaigns and understand which sources and mediums are driving the most traffic.



Better ROI Analysis: By understanding which campaigns are most effective, you can allocate your marketing budget more efficiently and maximize your return on investment.



Enhanced Reporting: UTM parameters provide granular data that can be used to generate detailed reports, making it easier to demonstrate the value of your marketing efforts to stakeholders.




How to Create UTM Parameters



Creating UTM parameters is straightforward. You can manually add them to your URLs or use tools like Google’s Campaign URL Builder. Here's a step-by-step guide:




Choose Your URL: Start with the URL you want to track.



Add UTM Parameters: Append the UTM parameters to your URL. Each parameter starts with a question mark ? and is separated by an ampersand &amp;. For example:




   https:&#47;&#47;www.example.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=spring_sale&amp;utm_term=spring_shoes&amp;utm_content=header_link




When in doubt, trust Google. Their UTM builder is a great place to get your feet wet.



Shorten Your URL: Long URLs can be cumbersome. Use a URL shortener like Bitly to create a more user-friendly link.




Best Practices for Using UTM Parameters




Consistent Naming Conventions: Use consistent naming conventions to avoid confusion and ensure accurate tracking. For example, decide whether you’ll use underscores or hyphens and stick to it.



Be Descriptive: Use descriptive and clear terms for your parameters. Instead of utm_campaign=campaign1, use something like utm_campaign=spring_sale_2024.



Use Lowercase: Google Analytics treats UTM parameters as case-sensitive. To avoid discrepancies, use lowercase for all parameters.



Track All Campaigns: Apply UTM parameters to all your marketing campaigns, including social media posts, email newsletters, and paid ads, to get a complete picture of your traffic sources.



Monitor Regularly: Regularly review the data, then adjust and optimize your campaigns for better performance.




Conclusion



UTM parameters are a simple yet powerful tool for tracking the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. By understanding where your traffic is coming from and how different campaigns perform, you can make data-driven decisions that enhance your marketing efforts. Start incorporating UTM parameters into your URLs today and gain deeper insights into your audience’s behavior. Happy tracking!

# OTT Advertising is a Game-Changer

Full Content:
In the rapidly evolving world of digital marketing, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. One of the most dynamic and influential trends reshaping the industry is OTT advertising. As traditional TV viewership declines and digital consumption soars, OTT (over-the-top) platforms are emerging as the new frontier for advertisers. For digital marketing agencies, understanding and leveraging OTT advertising can open up a world of opportunities to connect with highly engaged audiences in innovative ways.



What is OTT Advertising?



OTT refers to content streamed directly over the internet, bypassing traditional cable or satellite TV providers. This includes popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and many others. OTT advertising involves placing ads within these streaming platforms, reaching viewers who consume content on their terms.



Why OTT Advertising Matters



1. Audience Reach and Engagement: OTT platforms have seen explosive growth, with millions of subscribers worldwide. This vast audience is highly engaged, often watching their favorite shows and movies for extended periods. Unlike traditional TV, where viewers might channel surf or leave the room during commercials, OTT viewers are more likely to watch ads as part of their viewing experience.



2. Targeting Precision: One of the standout features of OTT advertising is its precise targeting capabilities. Advertisers can leverage data to target specific demographics, geographic locations, and even individual viewing habits. This level of targeting ensures that your ads are seen by the right people, maximizing the return on investment (ROI).



3. Ad Format Flexibility: OTT platforms offer a variety of ad formats, from short pre-roll ads to longer mid-roll and post-roll ads. Some platforms even allow for interactive ads, where viewers can engage directly with the content. This flexibility allows marketers to craft tailored messages that resonate more effectively with their audience.



4. Measurable Impact: Unlike traditional TV advertising, where metrics can be vague and imprecise, OTT advertising provides detailed analytics. Marketers can track ad performance in real-time, measuring views, engagement, click-through rates, and conversions. This data-driven approach allows for continuous optimization of ad campaigns.



Best Practices for OTT Advertising



1. Understand Your Audience: Leverage the rich data available on OTT platforms to deeply understand your target audience. Analyze their viewing habits, preferences, and behaviors to create highly relevant and personalized ad content.



2. Invest in Quality Creative: With viewers expecting high-quality content, your ads should match the production value of the shows and movies they accompany. Investing in high-quality creative ensures your ads capture attention and leave a lasting impression.



3. Optimize for Multiple Devices: OTT content is available across various devices, including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, and computers. Ensure your ads are optimized for different screen sizes and viewing environments to provide a seamless experience.



4. Leverage A/B Testing: Continuously test different ad creatives, formats, and targeting strategies to identify what works best for your audience. Use A/B testing to refine your approach and drive better results.



5. Integrate with Broader Campaigns: OTT advertising should be part of a cohesive digital marketing strategy. Integrate your OTT campaigns with other digital efforts, such as social media, search, and display advertising, to create a unified brand message and amplify your reach.



The Future of OTT Advertising



As the digital landscape continues to evolve, OTT advertising is poised for even greater growth. Innovations such as programmatic advertising, where ads are bought and placed automatically using data and algorithms, are making OTT advertising more efficient and effective. Additionally, the rise of ad-supported streaming services is expanding inventory, providing more opportunities for marketers to reach their audiences. Embracing this powerful medium can deliver impactful campaigns that drive engagement, build brand loyalty, and achieve exceptional ROI.



Conclusion



OTT advertising represents a paradigm shift in how brands connect with their audiences. For digital marketing agencies, it offers unparalleled opportunities to reach highly engaged viewers with precision-targeted, high-quality ads. By understanding the intricacies of OTT advertising and implementing best practices, agencies can harness its power to drive meaningful results for their clients. As the future unfolds, those who master OTT advertising will be at the forefront of digital marketing innovation.

Eric Clapton, often hailed as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, has a storied career that spans several decades and includes an impressive array of bands. His musical journey showcases not only his virtuosity on the guitar but also his ability to adapt and thrive in different musical environments. The various bands that Clapton has been a part of each contributed to his legacy in unique ways.



The Yardbirds: The Birth of a Guitar Legend



Eric Clapton's professional career began in earnest with The Yardbirds in 1963. Known for their pioneering contributions to rock and blues, The Yardbirds were the perfect incubator for Clapton's burgeoning talent. During his time with the band, Clapton earned the nickname "Slowhand" due to his precise and measured playing style. His tenure with The Yardbirds was marked by their hit single "For Your Love," but Clapton's purist blues instincts led him to leave the band in 1965 as they started moving towards a more commercial pop sound.



John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers: Mastering the Blues



Clapton's departure from The Yardbirds led him to John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, where he truly honed his craft. Joining in April 1965, Clapton's work with the Bluesbreakers is legendary. The 1966 album "Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton," often referred to as the "Beano" album, is a seminal work in blues rock. Clapton’s fiery solos and deep understanding of the blues idiom cemented his reputation as a guitar hero. His time with Mayall was brief but impactful, setting the stage for his next major venture.



Cream: The Power Trio



In 1966, Clapton co-founded Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce. Cream was one of the first supergroups and is considered one of the greatest bands of all time. Their music was a potent mix of blues, rock, and psychedelia, characterized by extended improvisational jams and virtuosic musicianship. Hits like "Sunshine of Your Love," "White Room," and "Crossroads" showcased Clapton's explosive guitar work and the band’s collective musical prowess. Cream disbanded in 1968, but their brief existence left an indelible mark on rock history.



Blind Faith: A Supergroup Experiment



Following Cream’s breakup, Clapton joined forces with Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood of Traffic, and Ric Grech of Family to form Blind Faith in 1969. The band was another supergroup, bringing together some of the most talented musicians of the era. Despite their potential, Blind Faith released only one self-titled album, featuring tracks like "Can't Find My Way Home" and "Presence of the Lord." The band's life was short, disbanding after just one tour due to internal pressures and Clapton's dissatisfaction with the supergroup model.



Derek and the Dominos: A Personal and Musical Odyssey



One of Clapton’s most personal and profound musical projects. Formed in 1970, the band included Bobby Whitlock, Carl Radle, and Jim Gordon. Their only studio album, "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs," is often cited as one of the greatest rock albums ever. The title track, "Layla," inspired by Clapton’s unrequited love for Pattie Boyd (then wife of George Harrison), features some of Clapton's most passionate and searing guitar work. The emotional depth and musical brilliance of this album have cemented its place in rock history.



A Solo Career and Collaborative Ventures



While Clapton’s band days are legendary, his solo career has been equally illustrious. Starting in the 1970s, Clapton released a series of successful solo albums, including "461 Ocean Boulevard" with the hit single "I Shot the Sheriff." He also collaborated with numerous artists and participated in various group projects, such as The Plastic Ono Band with John Lennon, Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends, and The Band’s historic "The Last Waltz" concert.



Conclusion



Eric Clapton’s journey highlights his versatility and enduring influence on the music world. From the raw energy of The Yardbirds and the blues mastery with John Mayall, to the groundbreaking work with Cream, Blind Faith, and Derek and the Dominos, Clapton has continually reinvented himself while remaining true to his blues roots. Each band played a crucial role in shaping his career, contributing to the rich tapestry of rock and blues that defines his legacy. Whether as a band member or a solo artist, Clapton's impact on music is undeniable and everlasting.

In today's competitive digital landscape, businesses need innovative ways to capture their target audience's attention. One powerful tool in the marketer's arsenal is motion graphics. But the question remains: Are motion graphics worth incorporating into your marketing strategy? Does the effort generate enough ROI?







Reasons to leverage motion graphics:




Enhanced Engagement: In a world bombarded with static content, motion graphics stand out. Their dynamic nature instantly grabs attention and keeps viewers engaged far better than static images or text alone.



Storytelling Potential: Motion graphics offer a unique opportunity to tell a story or convey a message in a visually captivating way. By combining animation, sound, and narrative, businesses can create memorable brand experiences that resonate with their audience on an emotional level.



Versatility: Motion graphics can be adapted to suit various platforms and formats, from social media ads to website banners to digital signage. Their versatility makes them an invaluable tool for reaching audiences across different channels.




However, it's essential to recognize that motion graphics are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Before diving into motion graphics for your ad campaigns, consider the following factors:




Audience Receptiveness: While motion graphics can be highly engaging, not all audiences may respond favorably to them. It's crucial to understand your target demographic and their preferences before investing in motion graphics.



Budget and Resources: Creating high-quality motion graphics requires time, talent, and resources. Businesses must weigh the costs associated with producing motion graphics against the potential benefits they offer in terms of increased engagement and ROI.



Alignment with Brand Messaging: Motion graphics should align seamlessly with your brand's messaging and values. Carefully consider whether the tone, style, and content of the motion graphics resonate with your brand identity and objectives.




Conclusion



While motion graphics can be a powerful tool for enhancing digital marketing campaigns, their effectiveness ultimately depends on factors such as audience receptiveness, budget, and alignment with brand messaging. By carefully evaluating these factors and incorporating motion graphics strategically into your marketing strategy, businesses can create compelling ad campaigns that resonate with their target audience and drive results.

In the vast landscape of digital marketing, Google Ads stands out as a powerful tool for businesses aiming to expand their online presence and reach potential customers. At the heart of Google Ads lies a crucial mechanism that often perplexes newcomers: bidding. Understanding how Google Ads bidding works is essential for maximizing your ad campaigns' effectiveness and achieving your marketing goals.



What is Google Ads Bidding?



Google Ads operates on a pay-per-click (PPC) model, where advertisers bid on keywords relevant to their target audience. When a user searches for a keyword, Google conducts an auction to determine which ads appear and in what order on the search engine results page (SERP).



Key Components of Google Ads Bidding:




Keywords: Keywords are the foundation of Google Ads bidding. Advertisers select keywords or phrases they believe their potential customers are likely to search for. These keywords trigger their ads to appear when users search for them on Google.



Bid Amount: Advertisers specify the maximum amount they are willing to pay for a click on their ad. This bid amount represents the maximum bid an advertiser is willing to set for a keyword.



Quality Score: Google considers not only the bid amount but also the quality and relevance of the ad and landing page. Quality Score is a metric that measures these factors. Higher Quality Scores can result in lower costs and better ad positions.



Ad Rank: Ad Rank determines the position of an ad on the SERP. It's calculated by multiplying the bid amount with the Quality Score. An ad with a higher Ad Rank is more likely to appear in a prominent position on the SERP.




How Does the Auction Work?



When a user enters a search query, Google runs an auction to determine which ads to show. The auction takes into account the bid amounts, Quality Scores, and ad formats of participating advertisers. The ad with the highest Ad Rank wins the top position, and subsequent positions are determined based on Ad Rank and other factors.



Tips for Effective Bidding




Keyword Research: Conduct thorough keyword research to identify relevant keywords with reasonable search volume and competition levels.



Monitor Performance: Regularly monitor your campaigns' performance and adjust your bids based on factors such as conversion rates, click-through rates, and return on investment.



Optimize Ad Copy and Landing Pages: Improve the quality and relevance of your ads and landing pages to boost your Quality Score and lower your costs.



Experiment with Bidding Strategies: Explore different bidding strategies, such as manual bidding, automated bidding, and target CPA or ROAS bidding, to find the approach that works best for your goals and budget.




Conclusion



Google Ads bidding may seem complex at first, but with a solid understanding of its key components and principles, advertisers can harness its power to drive targeted traffic and achieve their marketing objectives. By conducting thorough research, monitoring performance, and optimizing their campaigns, advertisers can make the most of their Google Ads investment and unlock new opportunities for business growth.

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, brand strategy stands as the cornerstone upon which successful campaigns are built. It's the roadmap that guides businesses through the maze of consumer preferences, market trends, and competitive landscapes. Crafting an effective brand strategy requires a deep understanding of the key elements that make up its foundation. 



Brand Identity



At the heart of every brand strategy lies its identity. This encompasses visual elements like logos, color palettes, typography, and imagery, as well as the brand's voice, personality, and values. A cohesive brand identity not only distinguishes a brand from its competitors but also fosters recognition and emotional connection with its audience.



Target Audience



Understanding your target audience is paramount in shaping your brand strategy. With thorough research and analysis, you can identify the demographics, psychographics, behaviors, and pain points of your ideal customers. This knowledge enables you to tailor your messaging, products, and services to resonate with your audience on a deeper level.



Brand Positioning



How does your brand stand out in the crowded marketplace? Brand positioning defines the unique space your brand occupies in the minds of consumers. Whether it's through product quality, pricing, innovation, or customer service, a well-defined brand positioning strategy communicates the value proposition that sets your brand apart from competitors.



Messaging Strategy



Your brand's messaging is the bridge that connects your identity with your audience. It encompasses the language, tone, and communication channels through which you convey your brand's story, values, and offerings. Consistent and compelling messaging across all touchpoints strengthens brand recall and fosters trust and loyalty among consumers.



Brand Experience



Every interaction a customer has with your brand shapes their perception and loyalty. From the first point of contact to post-purchase support, delivering a seamless and memorable brand experience is essential. This includes optimizing your website and social media channels, providing exceptional customer service, and maintaining consistency across all touchpoints.



Competitive Analysis



Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors is crucial for refining your brand strategy. By conducting a comprehensive competitive analysis, you can identify market gaps, anticipate industry trends, and capitalize on opportunities to differentiate your brand and gain a competitive edge.



Brand Extension and Adaptation



As markets evolve and consumer preferences shift, brands must be agile and adaptable. A robust brand strategy allows for flexibility in expanding into new markets, introducing new products or services, and evolving with changing consumer needs while staying true to the core essence of the brand.



In conclusion, a well-crafted brand strategy is the compass that guides digital marketers in navigating the dynamic landscape of the digital realm. By understanding and leveraging the key elements of brand strategy, marketers can establish a strong presence, forge meaningful connections with their audience, and ultimately drive success in the digital marketplace.

# Don't Blog for SEO

It's crucial balance focusing on your own blog's SEO and creating relevant content for your target audience. While SEO is important for driving organic traffic to your website, ultimately, your goal should be to create valuable and engaging content that speaks directly to your readers.



A blog might sound youthful to some, but it’s a must for businesses in the 21st century. According to HubSpot, websites with a blog receive 55% more traffic than those that don’t. Not enough proof? A study by Backlinko found that the top-ranking pages on Google tend to have an average of 1,447 words. This finding emphasizes the importance of in-depth, informative content that is valuable to readers and search engines.



These organic results (the focus of SEO) remain valuable even in an era of continuous advertising. According to Search Engine Land, 70-80% of users ignore paid ads and focus on organic search results. This underscores the importance of optimizing your content for SEO to increase visibility and attract organic traffic.



SEO is a powerful tool for increasing your website's visibility and ranking on search engine results pages. Optimizing your blog posts with relevant keywords, meta tags, and backlinks improves your chances that potential clients find you. However, simply focusing on SEO without considering what your audience wants can lead to disengagement and a high bounce rate.



Instead, consider incorporating client-centric content into your blog posts, supported by SEO strategies. Start by researching popular keywords and industry trends that are relevant to your target audience. Use these insights to create informative and engaging blog posts that address their pain points, offer solutions, and showcase your expertise in the digital marketing field.



Additionally, make sure to optimize your blog for user experience by incorporating engaging visuals, easy-to-read formatting, and clear calls-to-action. By striking a balance between SEO and client relevance, you can attract new visitors to your site, keep them engaged, and ultimately convert them into loyal clients.

# What is Bounce Rate?

Bounce rates are an important metric for understanding a site’s overall user experience.&nbsp;



Google defines bounce rate as:



“The percentage of single-page visits (i.e., visits in which the person left your site from the entrance page).”



Basically, this means that when a visitor “bounces” from a page, they have left the page and site after only viewing one page and not moving further on the site. A high Bounce Rate is usually an indication that something is negatively impacting the user experience on the site, making them leave before using the site more.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Let's jump into our top ten tips to reduce your bounce rate so your website can succeed in converting users to your intended goal!&nbsp;



Top Ten Tips to Reduce Your Website Bounce Rates



1. Optimize Page Load Time



When a user has to wait an excessive amount of time for a page load, it creates an incredibly poor user experience. The content on the page does not matter if a visitor cannot even see it immediately, and often leads to users impatiently leaving the site. Therefore, the faster you can make your website load, the less this will occur.&nbsp;



2. Include a Site Search Option and Navigation Bar



If a user is searching for something specific, you want to make it as easy as possible for them to find it without leaving the page. Therefore including a site search function can be extremely useful. Also, an intuitive navigation bar can help easily lead the user to the page they are looking for, so make sure your website has a simple and clearly laid out section.&nbsp;



3.  Make Mobile A Priority 



Mobile users have even less patience than desktop users. A website should have a design that is responsive and mobile-optimized in order to provide users on mobile devices the best experience.&nbsp;



4. Ensure Readability



Make sure your content is easy to read both in design and format. Users generally prefer short organized information to long paragraphs so that the information is easy to digest.&nbsp;



5. Utilize Different Forms of Content 



Another focus area when it comes to website readability is to create various forms of content for the user, as opposed to solely text.



Video content is incredibly engaging and easily grabs attention and high-quality images can also help to captivate the attention of visitors to a website and potentially reduce bounce rates.



6. Use Relevant Keywords 



Make sure that your website features the relevant keywords that are applicable to your site. If a site is ranking high for a keyword, but the site has no content about that keyword topic, then a user will quickly bounce from the website.



7. Stay Away from Popups



Users generally do not enjoy popups and find them to be invasive to their experience. Popups usually reduce trust in users because they signal that a site is tacky and pushy. Also, the irritation they create is contrary to a positive user experience.&nbsp;



8. Limit Broken Links



A large number of broken links will always create a poor user experience, leaving a visitor to a website dissatisfied and frustrated if they cannot locate the content that they want to find. There are a few different ways to locate all of the broken links on a website, such as through Google Search Console.



9. Show Credibility



Visitors are always looking for how trustworthy a site is before they use it. In order to help establish this trust, it is a good idea to include positive reviews of whatever products and/or services your site features and to include certifications or seals of approval that your website has.&nbsp;



10. Use Google Analytics 



Finally, track any major issues that come up on your site by using Google Analytics.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Google Analytics can track:




Time on site.



Bounce rate.



Pages per session.



Most frequently and least frequently visited pages.




You can view how users react to pages and then adjust and test changes on those pages accordingly.



Take-Aways:&nbsp;



You never want to lose valuable visitors to your website over issues that can be avoided. Implement our top tips to optimize your user experience and reduce high bounce rates.

# The Dos and Don'ts of Email Subject Lines

Full Content:
When it comes to email marketing, the subject line can make or break the success of your campaign. A well-crafted subject line can entice readers to open your email and engage with your content, while a lackluster one can result in your message being ignored and deleted. In this blog post, we'll discuss the dos and don'ts of email subject lines to help you optimize your email marketing efforts.



**The Dos:**



1. Be Clear and Concise: Keep your subject line succinct and to the point. Avoid using vague or overly long subject lines that can confuse or overwhelm readers.



2. Personalize: Use the recipient's name or other personalized elements in the subject line to grab their attention and make them feel valued.



3. Create a Sense of Urgency: Encourage readers to take action by using words that create a sense of urgency, such as "limited time offer" or "act now."



4. Use Numbers or Statistics: Incorporate numbers or statistics in your subject line to make it more compelling and impactful.



5. A/B Test: Experiment with different subject lines to see what resonates best with your audience. A/B testing can help you determine which approach is most effective for your target market.



**The Don'ts**



1. Use All Caps: Using all capital letters in your subject line can come across as shouting and turn off readers.



2. Overpromise: Don't make false promises or exaggerate in your subject line. Be honest and transparent in your messaging to build trust with your audience.



3. Spammy Language: Steer clear of using language or phrases that could trigger spam filters and harm your deliverability rates.



4. Overuse Emojis or Symbols: While fun and eye-catching, overusing them in your subject line can make your email appear unprofessional. Use them sparingly and strategically.



5. Neglect Mobile Optimization: Remember that many people read emails on mobile devices, so ensure your subject line is mobile-friendly and displays properly on small screens.



By optimizing email subject lines, you can improve the effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns and increase engagement with your subscribers. Remember to test different approaches, analyze the results, and continually refine your strategy to maximize the impact of your email marketing efforts.

# Can the Government Ban TikTok?

Full Content:
One of the most popular social media platforms in the world, TikTok has more than a billion active users. However, the app has faced extensive criticism and drawn scrutiny from governments around the world. The United States, the most vocal opponent, has considered banning TikTok due to concerns over data privacy and national security.&nbsp;



This has sparked a debate over whether the government has the authority to shut down a popular social media platform — and what the implications of such a move would be.



Can Congress Regulate Social Media?



First and foremost, it is important to note that the government does have the authority to regulate and even shut down social media platforms if there are legitimate concerns over national security or public safety. The government has the ability to enforce laws and regulations that protect its citizens from potential threats. Ergo, if TikTok is found to be in violation of these laws, it could be shut down.



It’s important to note that a ban has a high hurdle for legal justification. Congress can override First Amendment rights only if privacy and security concerns cannot be addressed by other means.&nbsp;



The Impact of a TikTok Ban



However, shutting down TikTok would have far-reaching implications for users, creators, and the digital marketing industry as a whole. TikTok has become a vital platform for brands to reach and engage with their audience in a creative and interactive way. Some influencers and content creators rely on TikTok as their primary source of income, and a shutdown could significantly impact livelihoods.



As a vital part of popular culture, TikTok provides a platform for marginalized voices. A shutdown could stifle diversity in the digital space, hindering progress towards an inclusive and equitable online community.



In conclusion, while the government does have the authority to ban TikTok, the implications of such a move are vast. A TikTok ban would impact users, creators, and the digital marketing industry as a whole. It is our hope that the government carefully considers the consequences of their actions and work towards finding a solution that protects the interests of its citizens while also fostering a safe and thriving online community.

# Will AI Take Over?

AI is exploding and is on trajectory to be a regular part of our day to day tasks. And this is freaking some people out! 



Is AI taking over? Let’s examine the basics. How exactly does AI differ from Google, and is ChatGBT the enemy?



Search Engine 101



Google and other search engines work by combing the web for content. These crawlers gather information about web pages, such as keywords, titles, and links, and index them in a database. When you enter query, the search engine uses complex algorithms to match t with relevant information in its index and displays the most relevant results to the user.



Ask a question and they will crawl through vast amounts of information for you. Taking into account your location, past searches, interests, popularity of sites and past behavior, they will instantly give you millions of search results, all neatly ranked and ready to use. It’s neat. It’s safe. It’s familiar.



How Does AI Work?



Instead of just searching, AI is generating. This freaks people out. Text, music, images, video, code, predictions, it’s all just a chat away. AI is also built to mimic human intelligence. Interact with a chat bot and you’re getting answers in full sentences and full on conversations. Systems work together within an AI system to allow it to reason, problem solve, learn from algorithms and over time, get better at what it does.&nbsp;



The Future of Computing



If you’ve ever seen an AI movie, you may have residual ick from watching robots take over the world. Hollywood may have started us out on the wrong foot when it comes to AI. Being able to chat with a computer like a human and see it produce a symphony probably adds to it. But let’s remember the days when it was creepy that search engines tracked our every move online in order to give us better search results. 



Is AI the future of modern computing? AI holds information for much longer than search engines, which have a shorter-term memory. Google will look at previous searches, while AI can analyze the entire historical data set related to the search question. Lean into the advancement. A self-aware program is at this point, a far-off theory. Instead, pop in some preferences and let it meal plan your week.

# Why Do Marketing Campaigns Fail?

Full Content:
Marketing campaigns are an essential aspect of any business. They increase brand awareness, drive sales, and grow a loyal customer base. However, not all marketing campaigns succeed. In fact, many do not achieve their desired outcomes, ending up a waste of time, money, and resources. So, why do marketing campaigns fail?



1. Lack of Clear Objectives



Without clearly defined goals and objectives, it's challenging to create a focused and targeted campaign that resonates with your audience. Before launching a campaign, it's essential to outline specific goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the campaign.



2. Poor Audience Targeting



If you don't understand your target audience's needs, preferences, and behaviors, your campaign is unlikely to reach and resonate with them. Thorough market research and detailed buyer personas can help you tailor your campaign messaging and targeting accordingly.



3. Ineffective Messaging



The messaging of your campaign plays a crucial role in its success. If your messaging is not compelling, relevant, or engaging, your target audience is unlikely to pay attention to your campaign. Make sure your messaging is clear, concise, and communicates the value proposition of your product or service. Test different messaging variations to see which resonates best with your audience.



4. Poor Timing



Timing can be everything in marketing. Launching your campaign at the wrong time, such as during a busy holiday season or when your target audience is not active, can lead to poor results. Conversely, a timely campaign can generate next level success.&nbsp; Make sure to consider factors such as seasonality, industry trends, and customer behavior when planning the timing of your campaigns.



5. Inadequate Budget and Resources



Marketing campaigns require a significant investment of time, money, and personnel. If you try to run a campaign on a shoestring budget or without adequate resources, you're likely to struggle to achieve your desired results. Allocate sufficient budget and resources to your campaigns to ensure you are not sabotaging your own success.



6. Lack of Consistency



If your messaging, branding, and promotional activities are not consistent across touchpoints, your campaign may lack credibility and fail to build trust with your audience. Ensure that your campaign is cohesive and consistent in its messaging and branding. Verbiage may vary on different mediums and channels, but the overall message should be reliable.



Conclusion



By addressing common pitfalls and implementing best practices in your marketing campaigns, you can increase your chances of success and achieve your desired outcomes. If you need assistance with planning, executing, or optimizing your marketing campaigns, consider working with a digital marketing agency that can provide you with the expertise and support you need to drive results.

In today's world, where everyone is glued to their screens, brands need to find new ways to reach their audience. For businesses, this means finding ways to stand out from the competition and engage with customers on a more personal level. 



What is Conversational Marketing?



This personalized approach to customer engagement uses dialogue-driven tactics to create a more interactive and engaging experience. It is all about creating a conversation that enables the customer to share their thoughts, feelings, and needs with the brand at each touchpoint.



Think of it as having a conversation with your customers rather than just talking at them. Instead of bombarding them with ads and sales pitches, conversational marketing focuses on building relationships and cultivating trust through two-way communication. It allows businesses to create a more personalized journey for their customers and take advantage of the opportunity to learn more about their target audience.



Why is Conversational Marketing Important?



The rise of conversational marketing is due to the fact that consumers are demanding more personalized and authentic interactions with brands. They want to engage with brands in a way that feels natural and relevant to their needs and preferences.



By adopting a conversational marketing approach, businesses can create a more human-like interaction with customers. This can increase engagement, build stronger relationships, and ultimately drive more conversions and sales.



Benefits of Conversational Marketing:




More personalized customer experiences&nbsp;



Improved customer engagement and satisfaction&nbsp;



Better understanding of customer needs and preferences&nbsp;



Increased efficiency and productivity&nbsp;



Greater potential for lead generation and sales&nbsp;



Competitive advantage in the marketplace&nbsp;




Implementing Conversational Marketing



To implement conversational marketing, businesses need to focus on creating a cohesive experience across all channels. This includes website chatbots, social media messaging, email marketing, and even phone calls.



To achieve this, companies need to invest in the right tools and technology to enable conversational marketing. This includes chatbots, messaging platforms, and other software that can automate conversations and provide personalized responses to customers.



In addition, companies should also train their teams to handle conversations in a way that is natural and engaging. This means being able to read a customer's tone and mood, asking the right questions, and providing relevant information to meet their needs.



In Conclusion



Conversational marketing is quickly becoming the norm in the world of digital marketing. It provides businesses a way to connect with customers on a deeper level, personalize experiences, and ultimately drive more sales.



As the world becomes more digital, conversational marketing will continue to grow and evolve. By adopting this approach now, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and build strong relationships with their customers for years to come.

Let's explore why this shift is happening and why it is becoming more necessary.



A.I. is Everywhere



One of the key drivers behind the trend of increased content production is the emergence of AI-powered content automation. This technology has evolved to a point where it can generate written content that is almost identical to that produced by human authors. With the advancement of AI systems, businesses and organizations can now create more content in less time, with less extensive human resources.



The benefits of AI-generated content are substantial. It allows teams to work more efficiently and focus their efforts on other important tasks, while still ensuring a steady stream of content. This automation can save companies both time and money, as they can reduce their dependence on manpower for content creation. Additionally, AI-powered systems can potentially eliminate human error and inconsistencies, resulting in more accurate and reliable content.



However, despite these advantages, AI-generated content has limitations. While it may achieve a high level of grammatical accuracy and mimic the style of human authors, it often lacks the emotional intelligence and genuine connection that human-written content can offer. Human authors possess a unique ability to infuse their writing with personal experiences, emotions, and perspectives that resonate with readers on a deeper level. This connection builds trust and engagement, making human-written content more impactful and memorable.



Furthermore, AI-generated content may struggle to capture the nuances of specific industries, cultures, or target audiences. It may not fully understand the subtle intricacies of a particular field, resulting in content that lacks the expertise or context required to resonate with readers. Human authors, on the other hand, possess the ability to tailor content to specific audience needs and preferences, employing empathy and intuition to create content that truly connects with readers.



Visuals Engage… Copy Closes



This leads us back to the importance of webinars and video content. While written content will always be necessary in some capacity, visual content is much more engaging. Text-based content can be easily skipped over or ignored, but video demands attention.



From a marketing standpoint, this is incredibly valuable. By creating compelling and informative video content, you can create an immersive, memorable experience, improving the likelihood your audience remembers your brand and your messaging.



However, it's important to note that simply producing video is not enough. The content must be relevant, valuable, and tailored to their target audience. AI can help marketers better understand this audience by gathering and analyzing data, allowing them to deliver targeted video content that resonates. Moreover, video content has the power to tell stories that evoke emotions.



Leading the Way in Thought Leadership



Looking ahead, the future potential of AI in content creation is exciting. While AI-powered creation can be a valuable tool, video content will be key to capturing attention, creating emotional connections, and delivering personalized experiences. By embracing the power of webinars, video content, and the potential of AI, marketers can future-proof their strategies and connect with audiences in a more engaging and meaningful way.

Google's on a Mission to Remove Third-Party Cookies



In an era where online privacy is becoming increasingly crucial for internet users, major tech corporations are taking significant steps to protect individuals' personal information. Google recently announced a groundbreaking initiative aimed at bolstering internet privacy by phasing out third-party cookies from its websites. 



Understanding Third-Party Cookies



Cookies are small text files stored on a user's device by websites they visit. Third-party cookies, in particular, originate from a domain other than the website a user is directly interacting with. They are often used for tracking user behavior, displaying personalized ads, and gathering data for targeted marketing purposes. While these cookies play a significant role in advertising, they also raise concerns about privacy invasion and data breaches.



Google's Mission: Protecting User Privacy



Recognizing the growing need for stronger online privacy measures, Google has taken an active stance to protect user data. Their decision to remove third-party cookies aligns with their overarching goal of putting control back into the hands of individuals, ensuring their personal information remains private and secure.



Enhanced User Control



Google's new approach emphasizes greater transparency and control over user data. Rather than relying solely on third-party cookies, they are developing new privacy-focused alternatives, such as the Privacy Sandbox. The Privacy Sandbox aims to strike a balance between personalized advertising and user privacy by allowing targeted ads based on aggregated data, without revealing personally identifiable information.



Mitigating User Tracking Concerns



Third-party cookies have long been associated with intrusive user tracking practices that raise red flags about privacy. With their removal, Google intends to establish a more privacy-centric ecosystem while still providing businesses with effective advertising tools. By shifting towards privacy-enhancing solutions, Google aims to preserve user trust and strengthen their commitment to protecting individual privacy rights.



Implications for Advertisers and Publishers



While the phase-out of third-party cookies may initially present challenges for advertisers and publishers who rely on highly targeted advertising, it also brings new opportunities. Google has been actively collaborating with industry partners to develop privacy-preserving alternatives. The Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) groups users with similar interests while maintaining individual anonymity. These advancements in cookieless advertising ensure that businesses can continue to effectively reach their target audience while respecting user privacy.



Collaborative Approach



Google's efforts to remove third-party cookies are not exclusive to their own platforms. They actively encourage collaboration and industry-wide initiatives to establish global privacy standards that benefit users, advertisers, and publishers alike. Open dialogues and collective brainstorming among stakeholders will contribute to a better understanding of privacy challenges and the development of equitable solutions.



Conclusion



Google's initiative to remove third-party cookies represents a significant step towards enhancing internet privacy, providing users with greater control over their personal data. By embracing privacy-preserving alternatives and fostering collaboration across the industry, Google aims to champion user privacy without compromising businesses' ability to advertise effectively. As the digital landscape evolves, it is paramount for tech leaders to prioritize privacy, ensuring a safe, secure online experience.

In this fast-paced digital age, marketers are constantly seeking innovative ways to capture the attention of their target audience and drive business growth. With the advent of smartphones and messaging apps, SMS marketing has emerged as a powerful tool for businesses to communicate directly with their customers, engage them, and ultimately, grow their bottom line. Let's explore key benefits and strategies of SMS marketing and how it can build a stronger connection with your audience.



Instantaneous and Direct Communication



One significant advantage of SMS marketing is delivering messages instantly and directly into the hands of your customers. SMS provides immediate impact, ensuring your messages aren't lost or overlooked in a user's crowded inbox.



Higher Open and Response Rates



SMS marketing boasts remarkable open and response rates, far surpassing those of emails. According to industry reports, SMS open rates reach an outstanding 98%, making it highly effective for reaching a wider audience. Furthermore, responses to SMS messages often occur within minutes, enabling businesses to engage customers in real-time.



Personalized and Targeted Messaging



SMS marketing allows for personalized and highly targeted messaging, enabling businesses to tailor their communication to specific customer segments. With the ability to include customer names, purchase history, and other personalized details, SMS messages give customers a sense of individual attention, leading to increased engagement and stronger brand loyalty.



Opt-in and Opt-out Flexibility



Unlike traditional marketing methods, SMS marketing allows customers to easily opt-in or opt-out of receiving messages. This opt-in approach ensures that your audience is genuinely interested in your offerings, leading to a higher likelihood of conversions. Additionally, the opt-out function helps maintain a healthy marketing relationship built on trust and respect.



Seamless Integration with Marketing and CRM Systems



Integrating SMS marketing into your existing marketing and CRM systems not only saves time but also increases efficiency. By tying SMS campaigns with customer data, marketers can leverage behavioral insights to deliver relevant, timely promotions, offers and alerts.



Automation and Personalization



With the help of automation tools and CRM integration, predefined behaviors can automatically trigger SMS messages. This enables businesses to engage with customers at the right stages of their journey, such as sending cart abandonment reminders, order confirmations, personalized offers, or post-purchase feedback messages. Automating these processes saves time and ensures consistent communication with your customers.



Conclusion



SMS marketing is a powerful tool for communicating with your audience, expanding reach, boosting engagement, and ultimately driving business success. With high open and response rates, the ability to personalize messages, and seamless integration with marketing and CRM systems, SMS marketing proves its worth as a cost-effective and efficient marketing strategy. By leveraging this technology, businesses can create personalized and targeted experiences, fostering stronger relationships and long-term customer loyalty.

# Navigating Social Media Regulation and Safeguarding Free Speech

Social media has become integral to marketing strategy, offering businesses and individuals the ability to connect, engage, and promote their products or services on a global scale. However, with this immense power comes the need for responsibility and accountability.



Recent discussions around social media regulation have gained momentum due to concerns over fake news, user privacy, data breaches, and the adverse effects on mental health. Governments are recognizing the urgency and exploring potential regulations to protect users and ensure a fair and transparent digital landscape.



One key concern is how to strike a balance between regulation and preserving the democratic tradition of free speech. While the precise mechanisms remain subject to legal and political considerations, one possible approach could involve a carefully crafted regulatory framework that fosters accountability and transparency without impeding free speech rights.



This may include:



1. Defining clear boundaries



Legislation could establish guidelines for social media platforms, defining the limits of acceptable content while safeguarding freedom of expression. Establishing criteria to differentiate opinion and satire from harmful or false information may be essential.



2. Encouraging self-regulation



Legislators could support industry self-regulation by working closely with social media platforms to establish voluntary codes of conduct. This would allow platforms to address issues such as hate speech, harassment, and misinformation while respecting their users' diverse viewpoints.



3. Incorporating public input



Engaging relevant stakeholders, including academia, civil society organizations, and experts in digital communications, could facilitate the development of legislation that considers a broad range of perspectives. Public consultations and open dialogues can lead to more comprehensive and balanced regulations.



4. Emphasizing transparency



Ensuring platforms provide clear explanations of their content ranking algorithms, advertising practices, and data usage can foster trust and enable users to make informed decisions. Transparency mechanisms could include regular audits and disclosure requirements.



5. Promoting user empowerment



Legislation could empower users with robust privacy settings, accessible reporting mechanisms for harmful content, and options to customize their experience. This, coupled with digital literacy programs, can empower individuals to navigate the digital space effectively.







It is crucial to approach potential regulation with a comprehensive understanding of the implications, weighing the need for accountability without infringing upon the democratic value of free speech. As the conversation around social media regulation continues, Pixaura will keep you informed of any significant developments and provide insights into how these changes may impact your marketing strategies.

# Gaining a Competitive Edge in Marketing: The Benefits of ISO 27001 Certification
> Safeguarding information has become an indispensable cornerstone of success amidst the dynamic marketing landscape.

Safeguarding information has become an indispensable cornerstone of success amidst the dynamic marketing landscape. As businesses navigate a sea of digital data and consumer interactions, securing sensitive information is a must to maintain campaign integrity and foster client trust. This is where ISO 27001 certification emerges as a tactical ally for marketers.



ISO 27001 is an internationally recognized standard specifically designed to fortify Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). This certification provides businesses with guidance for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system.



Its relevance in the marketing sphere is more than just a compliance requirement. It is a strategic imperative that can redefine your market positioning and enhance your credibility.



This article will explore the intricacies of ISO 27001 certification and its applicability in marketing, discussing its key principles and relevance to marketing. It will also unravel the benefits awaiting those who embrace robust information security practices and strategies for its seamless integration into your marketing endeavors.



What is ISO 27001 Certification?



This comprehensive framework serves as a formidable shield for businesses aiming to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information assets. ISO 27001 proactively establishes a robust foundation for identifying, managing, and mitigating information security risks.



The key principles and requirements that underpin ISO 27001 certification are stringent and adaptive. They demand a systematic approach to risk assessment and management, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. From defining scope to implementing security controls and conducting regular audits, ISO 27001 builds a dynamic structure that adapts to the relentless pace of cyber threats.



Now, one might ask, how does ISO 27001 resonate with the intricacies of marketing activities? The relevance becomes glaringly apparent in a realm where consumer trust is of great importance. Marketing activities, inherently data-driven, rely on the seamless flow of information.



ISO 27001 ensures the confidentiality and integrity of this data — making it the backbone of fortifying the security of your marketing efforts, protecting your campaigns from malicious intent, and establishing a foundation of trust for clients.



Benefits of ISO 27001 Certification in Marketing



Understanding the benefits of ISO 27001 will empower you to navigate the competitive landscape of marketing with a strategic advantage. Whether you're a seasoned professional in the realm of digital campaigns or venturing into the metaverse for business marketing, the advantages of ISO 27001 extend beyond compliance. It creates a robust foundation for success.



Protection of sensitive customer data



In a marketing environment where personalization is key, safeguarding records of demographics, preferences, and purchase history becomes crucial. 



Ensures the integrity and reliability of marketing campaigns



ISO 27001 reinforces the integrity of your marketing campaigns through all channels. That's because this certification ensures that the information disseminated remains accurate and unaltered. This enhances the effectiveness of campaigns and mitigates the risks associated with compromised data integrity.



Builds trust and credibility with clients



Information security is about more than protecting against data breaches. ISO 27001 is a badge of commitment to security, a reassurance to clients that their data is handled with the utmost care. This trust-building element is vital in a competitive market where clients seek partners who prioritize information security. Marketers armed with ISO 27001 can form stronger client relationships.



Enhances reputation and market positioning



Obtaining ISO 27001 certification elevates your company's reputation. It signals to the market that you adhere to globally recognized standards in information security management. This enhanced reputation attracts more, bigger clients and positions your brand as a leader in security-conscious practices, setting you apart in a crowded marketplace.



To further reinforce this commitment, marketers should also consider obtaining a SOC 3 report that provides an additional layer of transparency and assurance to customers and stakeholders.



Security Strategies for Marketers



As explained earlier, ISO 27001 serves as a commitment to systematically identifying, managing and mitigating risks. It involves a meticulous process of assessment, implementation, and validation, ensuring your organization meets the highest standards.



Another vital approach is the encryption of customer data. This initiative ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains indecipherable.



Secure communication channels then become the conduits through which your marketing strategies flow. Implementing encrypted communication channels ensures that vital information exchanged remains shielded from prying eyes, fortifying the integrity of your campaigns and interactions.



Conducting training and awareness programs for marketing teams is also a considerable effort. Educating your teams on the nuances of information security fosters vigilance, turning them into frontline defenders against potential threats.



Security, however, is a moving target as threats continuously evolve alongside the digital landscape. This consideration makes improvement and adaptation essential. Regular assessments and updates to security protocols ensure your marketing strategies remain resilient in the face of emerging challenges.



Conclusion



The benefits of ISO 27001 certification reverberate profoundly in the dynamic arena of marketing. Safeguarding sensitive customer data, ensuring campaign integrity, building trust, and enhancing reputation are more than just checkboxes; they are the keystones of a competitive edge.



Marketers navigating the complexities of digital landscapes are well-advised to consider and pursue ISO 27001 certification. In an environment where trust is vital, this certification becomes the beacon that sets you apart, signaling to clients and stakeholders that your commitment to information security goes beyond compliance.

As businesses become more "self-aware", many are questioning whether their marketing efforts are sustainable. The idea of sustainable marketing involves creating campaigns that not only benefit the business but also have a positive impact on society and the environment. But is there really such a thing as sustainable marketing?



The short answer is yes, there is such a thing as sustainable marketing. However, it’s important to understand that achieving sustainability in marketing is not a one-time event. Instead, it’s an ongoing process that involves continuous improvement and adaptation.



Campaigns that Connect to Core Values



At its core, sustainable marketing involves creating campaigns that align with the values and beliefs of the target audience. This means that businesses should take a more holistic approach to marketing that considers its impact on people, the planet, and profits.



One way to start is incorporating sustainability into the top levels of business strategy. This may involve setting goals for reducing the company’s environmental impact, such as reducing waste, using eco-friendly materials, or sourcing products from sustainable sources.



Businesses can also engage in cause-related marketing, where a portion of the profits from a product or service is donated to a social or environmental cause. This not only supports a good cause but also demonstrates the company’s commitment to making a positive impact.



Another important aspect of sustainable marketing is transparency. Customers want to know what they are buying and the impact it has on the environment and society. Businesses that offer transparent communication about their products and services can build trust with customers, which can lead to long-term relationships.



Sustainability Isn't Just a Buzzword



Sustainable marketing is a necessary approach for businesses that want to succeed in the long term. It involves considering the impact of marketing efforts on people, the planet, and profits and taking steps to align marketing activities with sustainable values. By doing so, businesses can build trust with customers, increase sales, and have a positive impact on society and the environment.

As we navigate the evolving landscape of remote and hybrid work environments, it is important to acknowledge the impact loneliness can have on our well-being. Although employees may not openly express their loneliness, it is crucial for us to address this issue proactively.



Studies have shown that loneliness can significantly contribute to remote employee burnout and decreased overall well-being. Many employees might not even realize they are experiencing loneliness, making it essential to prioritize building deeper connections within our team.



Here at Pixaura, we believe that fostering a supportive and inclusive work culture is vital for the success and well-being of our employees. To that end, we would like to share several strategies that help us strengthen our intra-team relationships:



1. Regular Team Check-ins: A platform for team members to share their experiences, concerns, and successes. These meetings can help create a stronger sense of belonging and ensure everyone feels heard. 



2. Virtual Social Events: Opportunities for team members to engage in non-work-related conversations, fostering a sense of camaraderie and friendship.



3. Mental Health Resources: Information and resource sharing within the company to raise awareness about the importance of mental well-being. Helps employees identify signs of loneliness and seek appropriate support if needed.



4. Flexibility and Understanding: In the remote or hybrid work model, employees may have different preferences and individual circumstances, and accommodating those needs promotes better work-life balance.



It's important to create a supportive, connected work environment in your organizations. By acknowledging and addressing the impact of loneliness, we can create cultures that promote employee well-being and productivity, while reducing remote employee burnout.

# Generative AI is Transformative for Marketers

“The development of A.I. is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.”Bill Gates




As the world continues to embrace digitalization, businesses are increasingly turning to advanced technologies to enhance productivity and improve the customer experience. One such breakthrough in the digital marketing industry is generative AI.



Generative AI is an automated technology that enables computers to create or generate new data. By utilizing deep learning neural networks, computers can create anything from simple images to complex 3D models. This process does not require any human intervention, as the computer learns and assimilates new information to generate unique data.



AI for Writing



In the digital marketing industry, generative AI has revolutionized many tasks that were once performed by humans. One significant application is the creation of text content in a fraction of the time it would take a human writer. The generated content not only ensures grammatical accuracy but can also be tailored to evoke specific tones and emotions.



AI for Web Design



Additionally, generative AI can assist in website design. By analyzing existing data, AI systems can develop new design templates that are visually appealing and functional for a particular business. Furthermore, AI can generate personalized marketing strategies targeted at specific audiences, thereby enhancing conversion rates.



AI is a Tool — Use It.



It is important to consider that AI is not intended to replace human efforts, but rather to complement them. At Pixaura, for example, we view generative AI as a valuable tool that enhances our capabilities and allows us to work more efficiently. By automating routine marketing tasks, AI enables our marketers to focus on crafting effective strategies to facilitate client growth.



As generative AI continues to evolve, it is sure to reshape the digital marketing industry. By streamlining processes and enhancing productivity, this technology is poised to be a game-changer in the field.



The advancements in generative AI have made it an asset to digital marketing agencies. At Pixaura, we don't use it to replace what we do... We use it to add to our toolbelt, increase our capabilities, and work faster and smarter.

LinkedIn has been adapting and evolving over the years, and it’s important for businesses to keep up with these changes. In the past, LinkedIn was primarily used as a platform for job seekers and recruiters. However, with the rise of content marketing, LinkedIn has become an excellent platform for businesses to showcase their expertise.



1. Content Creation is Still King



LinkedIn actively tweaks its algorithms to ensure that users are seeing content grounded in knowledge and advice, being produced by the people they know, follow, and care about.&nbsp;



Companies can create their own content, including articles, videos, and infographics, to share with their followers in order to build brand awareness, generate leads, and build relationships with other professionals in your industry.



To adapt to the current climate, businesses should focus on creating high-quality, insightful content that is shareable and will resonate with their target audience. It’s important to keep in mind your target audience’s pain points, and how your expertise can help solve them.



2. Personal Branding is Important



CEOs and executives are no longer hidden behind the brand, but instead are the face of the modern company. As businesses look for ways to differentiate themselves from their competitors, leaders can play a critical role in showcasing the values and mission of their company.



Business leaders should have an active presence on LinkedIn, and share their own thoughts on industry news, post company updates, and engage with followers. This personal connection not only builds trust with your audience (both customers and employees), but also humanizes the company.



3. Video Content is Key



Whether live-streaming, posting pre-recorded videos, or sharing content created by others, video is becoming increasingly important for businesses looking to connect with their audience. It gives companies the opportunity to showcase their brand personality, share industry insights, and give behind-the-scenes glimpses into the company culture.



Consider creating videos like interviews with key industry leaders or a behind-the-scenes tour of their office. Alternatively, share existing videos from industry events and thought leaders. Ensure your content is in your core subject area, speaks to a distinct audience, and offers a unique perspective based on your experience and knowledge.



4. Groups are Back in Focus



LinkedIn Groups have been around for a long time, but in recent years, they have fallen out of focus. However, LinkedIn is now bringing Groups back to the forefront of the platform as a way to connect with other industry professionals.



Businesses can create their own LinkedIn Groups to foster discussion, answer questions, and share industry news. Additionally, businesses should consider participating in other relevant LinkedIn Groups to build relationships with other professionals and showcase their expertise.



In conclusion, LinkedIn is changing, and it’s up to businesses to adapt in order to take full advantage of this platform. By focusing on content creation, personal branding, video content, and Groups, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and engage more effectively with their audience.

Full Content:
In today's fast-paced digital world, attention spans have become shorter, making it challenging for businesses to convey their message effectively. However, short-form video content offers marketers a golden opportunity to engage their target audience and achieve remarkable results. 



1. The Growing Popularity of Short-Form Videos



Short-form videos, typically lasting from a few seconds to a couple of minutes, might seem concise, but they pack a powerful punch. The rise of platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts has fueled the popularity of short video content and revolutionized the way people consume information online. Marketing agencies can no longer ignore the potential these platforms bring to the table.



2. Engaging and Captivating Attention



With declining attention spans, short-form videos offer the perfect solution for capturing and retaining the audience. Their bite-sized format, combined with visually appealing and attention-grabbing content, ensures viewers remain engaged. From witty product teasers to captivating storytelling, short videos allow marketers to convey their unique selling proposition in an exciting and memorable way.



3. Enhancing Brand Awareness



Key aspects like the integration of brand logos, effective use of colors, and consistent visual themes help establish a recognizable brand identity. As users swipe, scroll, or explore social media feeds, a well-crafted short video has the potential to create an instantaneous and lasting impression of a brand.



4. Virality and Shareability



Due to their concise nature, short-form videos lend themselves well to being shared across various social media platforms. The potential for virality is significantly higher with short videos as they are easily digestible content that can be shared with a single tap or swipe. This exponential reach amplifies brand exposure, potentially leading to increased brand loyalty and conversions. Short-form content isn't just for advertisements — it's ideal for storytelling, product launches and even customer testimonials.



5. Boosting ROI and Conversions



Short-form videos allow marketers to experiment with various storytelling techniques, creative visuals, and unique calls-to-action to drive conversions. Engaging content within a limited time frame encourages viewers to take immediate action, resulting in higher click-through and conversion rates. Additionally, these videos can be leveraged in email marketing campaigns, landing pages, and app installations, maximizing the return on investment for marketers.



6. Better Reach and Tracking



Social media platforms reward short-form videos with higher organic reach, ensuring they reach a wider audience compared to longer video formats. Furthermore, through platforms' analytics and insights, marketing agencies can track user behavior, view counts, engagement rates, and other valuable metrics in real-time. These data-driven insights help optimize campaigns, target specific demographics, and reach their ideal audience effectively.



Conclusion



In the era of fleeting attention spans, short-form videos have emerged as the digital marketing agency's secret weapon. They captivate, engage, and evoke emotions, making them a game-changer in the industry. Marketers who embrace this rising trend can unlock a world of opportunities and connect with their target audience in unprecedented ways. 



So, hop on the short-form video bandwagon and bring your marketing efforts to new heights.

In recent years, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have gained immense popularity in the world of digital marketing. These technologies have completely transformed the way businesses approach marketing and have given marketers a new way to connect with their target audience. In this post, we will discuss the use of VR and AR in digital marketing and their benefits.



What is Virtual Reality?



Virtual Reality is a technology that creates an immersive, computer-generated environment that users can interact with and experience as if it were real. The VR headset tracks the user's movements and adjusts the environment accordingly, creating a fully realized experience.



What is Augmented Reality?



Augmented Reality differs from VR in that it enhances the user's real-world experience by overlaying digital elements on top of the real world. This can be done through the camera on a smartphone or tablet, allowing users to view the real world through the lens of their device.



How are VR and AR used in digital marketing?



Product demonstrations



VR and AR can create product demonstrations that give the user a realistic experience of a product before they make a purchase. For example, a furniture company can give the user a virtual tour of their space and allow them to place furniture in the room to see how it would look.



Branded experiences



Brands can use VR and AR to create bespoke experiences for their users that are memorable and engaging. For example, a car company can use a VR headset to offer users a virtual test drive of their latest model.



Virtual events



VR and AR can create virtual events for brands. This could include virtual trade shows, concerts, and other events.



Training and education



VR and AR can create immersive training experiences for employees within various industries, from healthcare to aviation.



Benefits of VR and AR in digital marketing



Increased engagement



VR and AR provide a more immersive experience than traditional marketing methods, which increases user engagement.



Improved retention



Research shows that people remember information better when it is presented in a multisensory and interactive way. VR and AR take advantage of multiple senses, which improves retention.



Memorable experiences



Providing users with a memorable experience increases the likelihood they will share it with others, generating additional exposure for brands.



What's Next?



Virtual and Augmented Reality are exciting technologies that offer endless possibilities for digital marketers. VR and AR create more engaging and interactive experiences, helping you increase engagement and drive more sales. As the technology continues to evolve, expect to see more innovative and creative uses of VR and AR in digital marketing.

...you're missing opportunities to enhance your customers' experience by providing quick solutions to common queries, reduce customer support interactions, and increase conversions.



An online presence is more important than ever, as potential customers increasingly turn to the internet to research products and services. For businesses to stay competitive in today's marketplace, one component of a successful digital strategy is a website FAQ page.



An FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page is a comprehensive list of answers to the most frequently asked questions that customers have about your products or services. This page is an invaluable tool for businesses looking to provide customers with the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions.



Here are a few reasons why we advise our clients to create an FAQ page:



1. Builds trust with customers



An FAQ page provides customers with the information they need — without having to ask you for it. By providing answers to common questions, you show your customers that you care about their needs and are committed to providing them with the information they need to make the best choices.



2. Saves time for customer service reps



An FAQ page can help reduce the amount of time your customer service reps spend repeatedly answering the same questions. This allows them to focus on more complex issues, improving the overall quality of customer service.



3. Improves SEO



An FAQ page with high-quality, relevant content helps your website rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This, in turn, can drive more organic traffic to your website, improving the efficiency of your digital marketing strategy.



4. Demonstrates expertise



An FAQ page provides an opportunity to showcase your company's expertise and knowledge in the industry. A strong FAQ page conveys confidence in the products or services you offer, further building customer trust and loyalty.



In conclusion, an FAQ page is an essential component of a comprehensive digital marketing strategy. By providing customers with the information they need, reducing workload for customer service reps, improving SEO, and demonstrating expertise, you can drive more business to your website and contribute to overall business success.

# Maximize Your SEO Strategy with Voice Search Optimization

As technology evolves, so do consumer search habits. With the rise of smart assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, voice search optimization has become a crucial aspect of digital marketing.&nbsp;



What is voice search optimization?



Voice search optimization is the process of optimizing your website for natural language and long-tail keywords that people use when speaking into a smart device. The goal of voice search optimization is to ensure that your website content ranks higher when a user performs a voice search using a smart assistant.



Why is voice search optimization important?



The increasing popularity of smart devices and voice search has changed the way people search for information online. More than 55% of households already have a smart speaker, making voice search a significant part of daily life. Businesses need to optimize their website for voice search to ensure they stay visible to potential customers.



Voice search optimization also presents an opportunity to stand out from competitors. According to a study by Backlinko, only 4.3% of Google search results have a featured snippet. However, 40.7% of voice search answers come from featured snippets. Targeting featured snippets through voice search optimization can increase your business’s chances of appearing at the top of search engine results pages (SERPs) and driving more traffic to their website.



How can a digital marketing agency help?



A digital marketing agency can help your business by conducting keyword research and analyzing search queries specific to voice search. They can also optimize website content for the verbiage that people tend to utilize in voice searches.



In addition, a digital marketing agency can improve website’s speed, mobile friendliness, and overall usability. They can also help create content that is optimized for voice search, such as answering common questions related to a business and providing information about their products or services.



Voice search optimization is evolving into a critical aspect of digital marketing that cannot be overlooked. With the help of a digital marketing agency, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and stay visible to potential customers as technology continues to evolve.

As a digital marketing agency, we are always looking for ways to help our clients improve their online presence. One strategy that we highly recommend is the use of listicles on their websites. 



Listicles are articles or blog posts that are structured as a list of items. They can increase engagement, improve user experience, and enhance the readability of a webpage or blog post, but they're also great for SEO. Let's talk about some of the benefits of listicles:



1. Easy to read and share



Listicles are easy to read and share with others. They are often broken down into bite-sized pieces of information that are perfect for our time-pressed society. People are more likely to share content that is easy to access and digest.



2. Increases engagement and website traffic



Listicles are more likely to capture the attention of readers, leading to greater engagement with your website. This can result in higher traffic numbers, improving your website's overall search engine rankings.



3. Versatile content format



Listicles can cover a wide range of topics, making them a versatile content format. You can use listicles to share information, provide tips, showcase products, and more. They are perfect for providing value to your readers while also promoting your brand.



4. Provides structure and clarity



Listicles provide structure and clarity, making it easier for readers to understand the content. When information is presented in a list format, it becomes more organized and easier to follow. This, in turn, can improve user experience and lead to more satisfied customers.



5. Appeals to mobile users



Mobile users love listicles. They are easy to scroll through and read on small screens. With more people accessing content on mobile devices, using listicles can help you cater to this growing audience.



One Part of A Bigger Picture



In conclusion, listicles are a valuable tool for any business looking to improve their online presence. However, it's crucial to keep in mind that quality content and user engagement are the most critical factors for achieving high search engine rankings. 



So, while listicles can be an effective tool for SEO, they should be used alongside other strategies, such as keyword research, website optimization, and quality content creation.



At our digital marketing agency, we have numerous ways to help you achieve your online marketing goals. Ready to get started? Drop us a message here.

If you’re a website content creator, you might be familiar with Google’s “Your Money or Your Life” (YMYL) pages. If not, you need to be! 



YMYL pages can have a significant impact on a person’s life or finances, such as those related to health, finance, or legal matters. Google has implemented strict guidelines for YMYL pages to ensure that they are providing accurate and trustworthy information to their users.



One of the primary goals of the YMYL guidelines is to reduce the spread of misinformation on the internet. With so much information available online, it’s essential that users can trust the sources they’re reading. By providing strict guidelines for YMYL pages, Google is ensuring that their users can feel confident in the information they’re receiving.



What does this mean for content creators? 



If you’re creating content for a YMYL page, you have to ensure your information is accurate, trustworthy, and up-to-date. This can include conducting thorough research and citing credible sources to back up your claims.



It’s also essential to consider the user experience when creating content for YMYL pages. Many people may be looking for quick answers to urgent questions, so it’s crucial to provide information in a clear and concise manner.



Ultimately, the YMYL guidelines are about creating a safer, more trustworthy online experience for everyone. As a content creator, it’s your responsibility to ensure that the information you’re sharing is reliable and accurate. By following Google’s guidelines, you can help make the internet a better place for everyone.

# 9 Essential Elements of Effective Web Design

You have probably heard that first impressions are everything, but did you know that&nbsp;94% of first impressions&nbsp;are design related?



An effective business website needs to be attention-grabbing, and there are many components to consider. Even the smallest aspect can be key for converting visitors — or leaving your funnel empty.



We want to make the process more manageable for you, so we've put this guide together on what makes for an effective web design.



1. Purposeful Layout



Don't waste your users' time by making&nbsp;your design overly complex. Be sure to place tabs, logos, and call-to-actions buttons in logical, strategic places.



Your audience should be able to see them clearly. However, they shouldn't block any other relevant content or be distracting.



2. User-friendly Navigation



Navigation is a crucial aspect of the user experience. The navigation menu should be placed on top of the website pages and include a clear structure of the pages. Use of a dropdown menu can provide quick access to all sections of the website.



3. Visual Appeal



People will be more inclined to stay on your website if it's aesthetically pleasing. The colors, images, and videos should be consistent and relevant to your brand. Continuity also helps users to understand that they are on the same website even when they move to different pages.



4. Responsive Design



It's essential to ensure your website is usable and accessible on all devices. The website should adapt to different screen sizes, from desktops to tablets to mobile devices. Responsive design makes it easy for users to access your website, regardless of their device.



5. Proper Use of Whitespace



Whitespace, the space between web design elements, helps in creating visual clarity. The proper use of whitespace can make the website look clean, organized and helps to draw attention to important website elements.



6. Compelling Content



While your content should be visually appealing, it should also be engaging and relevant. It needs to grab and hold the attention of the user. Your message should be clear, concise, and readable.



7. Use Images and Videos



Visual elements like images and videos, help in breaking up text-heavy content. Proper use of visual elements can make the website more interactive, engaging and more enjoyable for users to interact with.



8. Accessibility



Your website should be accommodating to those with disabilities. Having features such as alternative text for images, proper heading structure, and keyboard navigation support will make it easier for people to use your site. It also lets your consumers know that you care and will build brand loyalty as well.



9. Include a Call-to-Action



Call-to-action buttons are essential for user engagement, informing users what action they should take next. The CTA should be designed in a way that is easy for users to find, recognize and understand. It should be visually distinct and persuasive, and encourage your users to make a purchase, subscribe, sign up for newsletters, or invest in your services.



Elements of Web Design



Knowing which elements to include for an effective web design can be challenging and overwhelming. 



However, working with a professional will help you build the best website possible. Designing business websites is our forte and we are confident we can help you and your business.

AI is one of the fastest-growing markets — projected to reach&nbsp;$407 billion by 2027! However, 75% of the population expresses concerns about AI accuracy.



To get the best use out of AI, you need to know which platform generates the most accurate and engaging content.



Read on to see a comparison between AI's largest contenders: Bard vs. ChatGPT.



Current and Reliable Information



The biggest problem with AI is getting current and reliable answers from chatbots.



ChatGPT's free version is limited in this regard because it's not connected to the internet. The data is stored in the chatbot's knowledge base and only contains information from 2021 and earlier.



Bard is connected to Google's search engine and scans the internet for results. This allows it to provide up-to-date information from the most current data online.



Checking the reliability of chatbot responses is also important. Bard's responses ensure better accuracy or at least help you confirm information by providing links and references to the data it presents in its content. To get this feature on ChatGPT, you need to upgrade to the paid version: ChatGPT-4.



Multiple Version Options



With AI for marketing automation, you need content that fits your brand, voice, and audience. Bard includes this feature automatically by producing three different versions of a response. You can also automatically adjust the response by length or tone, which is great for campaigns spread across various digital marketing mediums.



To get a different version of the response in ChaptGPT, you must regenerate the prompt again. To change the tone or length, you have to instruct the chatbot to make these changes.



Word Retention



Currently, AI for marketing is limited when you attempt to use previous conversations or prompts to generate a response. ChatGPT has a retention limit of 3,000 words and cannot access past conversations from a different session. However, it does store old responses that you can return to.



Google has stated that Bard purposely limits word retention for privacy reasons, but it does store old conversations that you can use when starting a new chat.



Word retention and access to stored conversions on both chatbots help when you need to revise marketing content. You can return to old projects to make minor adjustments or alterations.



Upgrades and Accessibility



If you are wondering whether you&nbsp;should use ChatGPT&nbsp;or Bard at all, you first need to consider if you want to pay for it. Both chatbots have free versions, but the free ChaptGPT has limited features. The paid upgrade does allow you to get responses faster when demand is high.



Bard only has a free version, but it is available only in select countries and is expanding slowly. You'll get all of the AI benefits for free and it has the ability to integrate into other Google apps like Workplace and Gmail.



Your Decision: Bard vs. ChatGPT



Like everything else, there are pros and cons to both Bard and ChatGPT. However, Bard does make creating marketing content more convenient. You can compare versions, check accuracy, and get current data to display for your customers.

What Is Threads and How Is It Different?



If you're looking for a new social media platform that offers control over your content and encourages meaningful conversations, you might want to consider Threads. Created by the Instagram team, Threads is a text-sharing app that allows users to join public conversations, post text updates, links, photos, and videos of up to 5 minutes long. But, how is Threads different from other social media platforms, and what makes it stand out?



Why Threads Exists



According to research, many users are frustrated with the direction of Twitter. Moreover, Mark Zuckerberg sees an opportunity for Meta to offer a Twitter-like solution, and Threads fills that gap. By using Meta's algorithm, the new platform curates the content that best suits your interests and behavior, delivering it in an orderly fashion — unlike Twitter's chaos. With 3 billion worldwide users, Meta's advertising engine will likely benefit Threads for advertising purposes. 



Threads Compared Other Social Media Platforms



Threads offers a few key differentiators when compared to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. One of the most significant differences is that you can post links directly in your content - something that Instagram doesn't allow its users to do. Furthermore, you can't create hashtags within the app, emphasizing the importance of the main post as the initiator of the conversation. That said, Threads will soon make its debut in the Fediverse, demonstrating Meta's recognition of the potential of decentralized social networking and showing that content from one social media platform can be shared/visible on another.



This quick comparison between Threads, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok list some key differentiators.







Is Threads right for your audience?



If you're already on FB, Insta, or Twitter, we recommend creating a Threads account, which is easy to do by syncing your Instagram account with the app seamlessly.







“Within two days of its launch, Meta's new Twitter rival Threads became one of the most rapidly downloaded apps ever, amassing more than 75 million users.” - Forbes



Control Your Feed



Threads gives you the ability to mute, hide, block, or report any user whose content you don't want to see, providing more control over your content.&nbsp;



Repost and Share



It's easy to repost and share content, which is integral to the growth of the original thread. Once you've set up your account, it's easy to use.



Can You Advertise on Threads?



Currently, the app does not host any ads, but most likely, it will use Meta's Business Suite in the future. When this happens, we can help you manage your Social Media PPC campaigns.



Should You Be Blue Dot Verified?



If you're a company, we recommend having a Blue Dot-verified account, which is connected to your Instagram verified account. A Blue Dot account typically costs $15/month.



Our Recommendation



We recommend syncing your Instagram account with Threads to make account creation seamless. There is no charge for us to set up your account. Ready to join the new party? Get in touch!

Let's start at the end — Facebook Ads work in large part because Facebook is HUGE. How huge?



In April 2023, Facebook had about 3 billion monthly users!



Social media has become an incredibly powerful marketing tool, and Facebook leads the way. Before you create any Facebook ads, however, you need to know how to use them effectively. In this guide, we'll go over how you can create successful Facebook ads that will boost your ROI. 



Build a Marketing Funnel



Creating a single ad is one thing, but to truly have an impact, focus on building a solid marketing funnel. An ad is a great way to bring in prospects, but you need to be able to guide them to ultimately make sales.



The initial ad should include a lead magnet that catches users' attention. Make sure it's interesting enough to encourage them to click through to your landing page. At this point, you should offer something of value that encourages them — sign up for a free trial, for example.



The next stage is conversion, which could be a page where they opt-in to receive emails from your brand. You should have an auto-responder sequence in place that helps turn these leads into paying customers.



Putting effort into every stage of your marketing funnel helps prospects want to take the next step.



Remarket to Your Previous Audience



Increased business is why we work to get new eyes on your ads. At the same time, you can't ignore users that have already shown some interest.



With Facebook ads manager, you can retarget users who've already shown some attraction to your products or services. This means that you can show reminders to people who have clicked on one of your ads in the past but not proceeded further through the marketing funnel.



They likely have some sort of interest in what you offer. Showing them a different (but relevant) ad has a good chance of catching their attention again. It can be more effective to reach out to people you already know are interested, rather than always trying to reach new customers.



Run Several A/B Tests



You want your Facebook ads to cost as little as possible while still being highly effective. As such, it's important to compare the results your different ads are producing.



In most cases, your early ads won't be the most successful. With time, your marketing skills will improve and you'll easily be able to make better ads. It's good to try different versions of ads and compare their performance after launch.



A/B testing involves launching two slightly different ads, and seeing how the results change based on the variation. You can try different colors, headlines, designs, landing pages, etc. 



Keep your variables minimal so you can correctly attribute which changes are responsible. Seeing what your audience responds to the most lets you optimize your ads. With time, you'll be able to improve your your entire campaign's effectiveness.



Know Your Ideal Customer



Before you put out ads, you have to know who you're targeting. 



Think about what may interest or catch the attention of your potential customers. Also, consider what problems they're trying to solve and how much they're willing to spend to do so. This will help you tailor your ads so that they resonate with your audience.



Create Compelling Headlines



There are plenty of Facebook ad specs you'll want to think about, but some of the most important elements are also the simplest. The headline is one of the first things people will see, and if it doesn't immediately catch their attention, people will simply scroll past it.



It can be a good idea to create various headlines for different demographics. What may be of interest to men aged 45-60, for example, may not garner the same interest from women aged 20-30 years old.



Keep Track of Your Campaign Performance



Even if you think your ads are perfect, you can only be sure if you track their performance. The metrics you can track include clicks, conversions, and impressions.



Analyzing these metrics allow you to optimize your ads to be even more effective, and prioritize resources more efficiently so that you can get the results you're after.



Make Use of Different Ad Types



Facebook has a wide range of ad types worth taking advantage of. Some available options include:




Images



Videos



Slideshows



Stories



Carousels



Collections



More




Determine which types resonate the most with your audience and focus on them. 



Creating Effective Facebook Ads for Your Brand



It can take a while to create an effective marketing campaign, but with some solid Facebook ads, you'll be able to drive a lot more conversions. It can be helpful to work with a professional agency that has the skills and experience to help you create a Facebook Ads campaign that will generate strong results.

If you're in the business-to-business (B2B) sphere, you'll need to rely on different marketing strategies than a business-to-consumer (B2C) company will. However, the key to new business and leads today for almost any business lies with social media.



Let's talk about social media for B2B, why it matters, and how you can get the most from it.



Why Is Social Media for B2B Important?



Here are some reasons you should embrace B2B social media strategies:



This is Where the Leads Are



Social media opens you up to a wealth of business prospects that you can leverage. Since this is where everybody congregates, there are virtual infinite opportunities available as long as you know how to effectively communicate.



Explore your customer experience, and reverse engineer it to find how you can communicate with your prospects. Since your customer base is other businesses, study their pain points and how your products and services solve their problems.



Communicating effectively on social media can draw meaningful attention that you can leverage and use to your advantage.



Your Competition Uses Social Media



Next, keep in mind that your competitors are all on social media. In today's business climate, you have to invest and compete in this landscape with well-designed B2B marketing approaches.



A major part of mastering marketing boils down to beating out your competitors for the time and attention of your potential customers. With people tied to their smartphones and tablets today, using quality social media marketing will help you gain their attention.



It's a Cost-Effective Approach



Social media is one of the more cost-effective forms of marketing. Building your social media presence will help you grow your brand reputation and awareness while opening you up to the widest possible audience. When you put together a budget that works for you, the return on investment (ROI) for organic social can be tremendous, and PPC social media advertising also allows for your dollar to be stretched quite far.



Hammer Out Your Brand Personality



Your brand strategy determines your brand personality, which in turn directs how you connect with people and companies that are seeking your services. With a strong brand identity, you'll be able to market to them in a way that you can leverage into sales and repeat business.



Choose the Right Social Media Outlets



There are many social media platforms available, but not all will be fruitful for your goals. Some of the most popular social media platforms for B2B companies include LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.



Don't hesitate to think outside of the box and factor in the methods that'll help you capitalize most. Each social media platform requires a different approach and comes with its own set of pros and cons.

Statistics show&nbsp;that 90% of leading marketers have found success with personalized marketing. It has the potential to significantly increase your earnings.



Personalized marketing leverages consumer data to appeal to specific consumers, allowing businesses to market to the needs of their potential customers. 



But if you use information about your customers that they don’t realize you have, or without getting a clear picture of their wants and needs, the odds are good your efforts could backfire and alienate them.



The problem is personalized marketing could quickly become a bit.... well, creepy.



What Is Creepy Marketing?



The term creepy marketing is used when personalized marketing goes too far, or the marketing plan goes beyond personalization and becomes invasive.



This can happen if private data is being used to market to customers. This can come across as very creepy since the customer may not have realized that their data was collected.



When Does Marketing Become Creepy?



A personalized marketing strategy is a great option for many businesses. It can help you appeal to specific customers and understand them better.



But you have to be careful when you are&nbsp;collecting personal data. You do not want to become too specific with your marketing as this can be alarming to customers.



For instance, if you own a streaming business, you have A LOT of that person‘s data. And although there are benefits for you in knowing what they have been streaming, it's important to use that data sparingly and in their best interest.



How to Avoid Creepy Marketing



Don't get us wrong - you *should* use personalized marketing. You just need to make sure you use it in a smart way and don’t cross the line.



Only use data that applies to your business. If you see that a customer likes a certain product, you can use that in your marketing strategy.



Don’t personalize marketing to include your customers' personal lives. This is where it becomes creepy and drives away potential customers.



Avoid Going Too Far



There are many types of marketing that businesses should take advantage of. One of those marketing plans is personalized marketing for each of your customers.



This is when marketing is applied to each individual to encourage them to use your services. One example of this is recommending a product similar or complementary to one that they already bought.

# Growth Marketing Secrets: Insider Tips and Tricks to Scale Your Business

Unlocking the true potential of your business and achieving sustainable growth is the top priority for any entrepreneur or marketer. But in today's fiercely competitive landscape, traditional marketing strategies may fall short. This is where growth marketing comes in.



By employing innovative techniques, leveraging data-driven insights, and focusing on customer-centric approaches, growth marketing holds the key to taking your business to new heights. In this article, we'll uncover some insider tips and tricks that will help you scale your business.



The Power of Content Marketing



Maximizing the Potential of Content Marketing



One of the most effective tools in a growth marketer's arsenal is content. It allows you to engage your target audience, build brand awareness, and establish thought leadership. However, simply creating content isn't enough—you’ll need to back it with a stellar content strategy.



Crafting Compelling Content



To create content that truly resonates with your audience, it's important to understand their needs, pain points, and goals. Conducting research and identifying the topics most relevant to your target market enables you to provide valuable insights, actionable advice, and compelling storytelling.



Utilizing Multiple Channels



Diversifying your content distribution channels is crucial for reaching a wider audience. By leveraging social media platforms, industry forums, guest blogging opportunities, and email marketing, you can amplify your content's reach. By being present where your audience spends their time, you increase the chances of attracting new customers and driving growth.



Repurposing and Recycling



Don't let great content go to waste. Repurpose and recycle your existing content across different platforms and mediums. Transform a blog post into a video or a podcast episode into an infographic. You'll extend the reach of your content and cater to different consumption preferences.



The Importance of Data and Analytics&nbsp;



Getting Into The Nitty Gritty of Data&nbsp;



To achieve sustainable growth, data-driven decision-making is essential. Implementing a robust customer relationship management (CRM) system can help you collect, analyze, and utilize valuable customer data. This will help you identify patterns, understand customer behavior, and make informed marketing decisions.



Personalization and Segmentation



With the insights gathered from your CRM solution, you can create highly personalized marketing campaigns tailored to the specific needs and preferences of your audience segments. By delivering targeted messages, offers, and recommendations, you increase the likelihood of conversions and customer loyalty.



Conversion Rate Optimization



Analyzing data also allows you to optimize your conversion rates. By identifying bottlenecks and friction points in your customer journey, you can make data-backed improvements to your website, landing pages, and checkout process. A/B testing, heatmaps, and user feedback tools are invaluable in this regard, helping you iterate and refine your marketing funnel for maximum effectiveness.



Using Predictive Analytics&nbsp;



Harness the power of predictive analytics to anticipate customer behavior and optimize your marketing campaigns. By analyzing historical data, you can identify patterns and trends that shape future customer actions. Leverage these insights to personalize your messaging, identify cross-selling opportunities, and enhance customer satisfaction.



Leveraging Social Media Advertising



Targeted Ad Campaigns



Social media offers powerful advertising tools that enable you to reach your target audience with precision. Use the available targeting abilities to create highly focused ad campaigns. Define specific demographics, interests, and behaviors to ensure your ads are seen by those most likely to be interested in your products or services.



Retargeting and Remarketing



Retargeting and remarketing tactics help you stay top-of-mind with potential customers who have already shown interest in your brand. Via browser cookies, you can display targeted ads to users who have visited your website or interacted with your social media content, boosting the chances of converting leads into customers.



Social Media Contests and Giveaways



Running contests and giveaways on social media platforms is an effective strategy to increase brand visibility and engagement. Encourage users to participate by liking, sharing, commenting on your posts, tagging friends or using specific hashtags. This generates buzz around your brand, expands your reach, and drives traffic to your website or landing pages.



Embracing Innovative Strategies&nbsp;



Influencer Marketing



In recent years, influencer marketing has become increasingly popular. Partnering with personalities that align with your brand can help you tap into their engaged audience and increase brand visibility. Seek out influencers who can authentically endorse your products or services, reaching new audiences and driving growth through their influential networks.



User-Generated Content



Harnessing the power of user-generated content (UGC) can be a game-changer for growth marketing. Encourage your customers to share their experiences, reviews, and testimonials. UGC not only provides social proof but also serves as a powerful word-of-mouth marketing tool, as customers are more likely to trust recommendations from their peers.



Gamification and Rewards



Adding gamification elements to your marketing strategies can enhance user engagement and create a sense of excitement and reward. Consider implementing loyalty programs, referral systems, and interactive quizzes to keep your audience actively involved with your brand. By making your marketing efforts fun and interactive, you can boost customer retention and generate organic growth.



Final Thoughts&nbsp;



Scaling your business requires a strategic approach to growth marketing. By employing the strategies listed above, you’ll get the extra boost needed to propel your business to new heights.&nbsp;



Remember, growth marketing is a continuous journey of experimentation, analysis, and adaptation. Stay agile, stay focused, and watch your business thrive!&nbsp;

# 9 Signs You Need to Hire Social Media Management Services

Take a guess at how many Instagram accounts there are all over the world. 



The answer is that&nbsp;over 2 billion people&nbsp;log into Meta's picture-sharing giant — that's a massive chunk of the world, and it's only one social media platform.



Social media began in earnest in 2004 with Facebook. Now it encapsulates Twitter, LinkedIn, and dozens of other social media websites. Without social media management services, it's easy to fall behind.



There is no getting around it — social media needs to be a central part of your digital marketing. But it's hard to see the benefit when your current strategy is ineffective.



These nine signs may indicate you need to hire social media management services.



1. If You Don't Have Social Media Management Services



For years now, the term "Social Media Manager" has been appearing in job classifieds. For the uninitiated, it may seem like a joke position tantamount to an Instagram influencer. But this role is very real — and very important.



You can't just post on social media and call it a day.&nbsp;There are optimal times to post for engagement and traction. Posts need to include hashtags and provide engagement with related pages and services.



For a reasonably sized business, this can be a full-time position. So if you've never hired social media management before, you absolutely should.



2. You Have No Social Media Presence



Many businesses cling to the old ways of having Google postings and websites. These are important components of your marketing strategies, but they're not everything, and they're not enough.



It takes a lot of time, effort, and expertise to build a social media presence from scratch. You need to learn the algorithms and amass a following. This can take considerable effort over the course of months.



3. You Are Lacking in Engagement



Engagement can be loosely defined as how much your posts are being noticed. More attention and more likes means the algorithm will then show your posts to more people. 



If your numbers are low and you're not sure why, there's a good chance you need a shift in tactics. New marketing ideas from a competent marketing firm will boost your numbers to much better levels.



4. You Struggle to Understand How Certain Platforms Work



Each social media platform has its own rules and culture. Take TikTok, for example. If you don't understand how to duet and stitch videos, your videos will flounder before ever reaching the For You page.



A digital marketing ageny understands and specializes in these social media trends. They can make sure your business or product reaches as many eyeballs as possible on the most suitable platforms.



5. You Aren't Getting Success from Ads



Targeted ads are a primary tool for customer conversions. The right ad campaign can bring in a new stream of revenue. The wrong ad campaign, however, just drains your budget.



Good ads combine proper placement, design, and platforming. A social media management service can help you get the right mix of those things.



6. You Don't Have Enough Time to Manage Your Social Media



As we've mentioned, a social media manager can easily be a full-time position. Aside from creating posts, there are metrics to track and customer inquiries that need responses. Over an average day, this can easily consume a full eight hours.



If you are running your social media campaign yourself, you're likely aware how much of a commitment it really is. Hire out the work to a specialist and use your time for what matters most.



7. You Can't Handle All the Messages



Many customers today will inquire with you directly through social media rather than by email or phone. Delay too long in responding, and they may grow frustrated and pose the same question to your competitor. In fact, some social media platforms like Facebook will tell people how fast you respond.



Prompt online responses are as essential as any other type of customer service. A social media management team can tackle all of that and more.



8. You Are Launching a New Product or Service



Garnering attention for a new product works best with all-out promotion. We're talking PPC ads, SEO-optimized articles, and fresh social media posts. This is a full plate of work — again something that will give a single person (or several) plenty to work on.



Getting a large initial interest to maximize sales starts with your digital marketing. As you prepare for the revealing of a new product line or service, social media management can make a real difference.



9. You're Not Sure How to Handle Social Media Marketing Tools



There's more to running a company Instagram account than a smartphone and some fast fingers. There are digital tools that provide deep insight into post metrics. Some of these tools cost money and require skill and experience to use them effectively.



There may also be additional things you didn't consider in your budget. Cameras and professional editing software may be necessary to portray your company in the best light. Instead of purchasing these tools yourself, a social media management service likely already has access to the right tools.



Pixaura's Social Media Management Service



Social media is a rabbit's warren of confusing algorithms and engagement strategies. You need more than just cute Instagram posts - you need a sound strategy and an enthusiastic team. Our social media management services provide you with the right tools, boost engagement, and free up your schedule for more pressing tasks.

# Page Builders Suck

There are about&nbsp;2 billion websites&nbsp;on the internet! With so many existing sites, and new ones popping up every day, it may seem impossible to create something unique that grabs attention.



Many people are going about it the wrong way, using page builders for cheap and easy website design instead of hiring a pro. Is that really the best option?



They're Too Limited for Big Ideas



When you see advertisements for a page builder, the marketing always makes it look limitless. 



"Look at all these unique websites people have created with one simple tool! Look how&nbsp;easy&nbsp;it is to create a completely custom website!"



In reality, page builders have their fair share of limitations.



If you're only interested in basic no-frills website design, with nothing special, unique, or innovative, you may be fine sticking with a page builder. Your website will look similar to most websites out there, but there's no doubt that it will function and look neat and clean.



However, do you want that for your company website? For a personal site, sure, but a business website needs to be memorable. Your website is a critical extension of your brand.



Yes, there are customization options on page builders — but they're the same ones everyone else is using. While it's possible to create a unique and interesting website within those limitations, it is far more difficult and time-consuming than starting from scratch, unless you're already a savvy designer.



In short, the page builder could be holding you back and restricting your website's potential.



They're Inconsistent



"Well okay," you're thinking, "but at least the page builders will create reliable websites that are easy to use and maintain, right?"



At one time, that may have been true. While in their simplest form, page builders can create hands-free websites, the same can't be said for websites with many functional pages and mechanisms.



Page builders are simple. They don't handle complexity well, and that means that you may end up with inconsistent code and other functionality issues.



This can cause your website to perform poorly. It can also cause problems with search engine optimization, hurting your website's visibility and organic traffic. What good is a website if it's actively inhibiting your growth?



When you&nbsp;work with a pro, you have a far lower chance of inconsistencies. If problems do arise, you'll have someone available to fix them right away.



They'll Bloat Your Website



Despite their simplicity, page builders have a habit of bloating websites with excess code. This can create functionality problems and slow down your site.



That might not seem like a huge problem, but site speed is critical. Did you know that many users are unwilling to wait&nbsp;more than five seconds&nbsp;for a website to load? If you're up against a world of insta-loading websites and short attention spans, you only have a few seconds to hook potential customers.



Slow load times are more acceptable when something impressive is slowing down the site, but this won't the case with a page builder's cookie-cutter website design. The bloat simply isn't worth the potential lead losses.



Professionally-made websites will be faster, less bloated, and again, if there are problems with speed, a professional can make quick work of them (pun intended).



They're More Expensive Than You Think



You may be thinking that despite their faults, page builders are still worthwhile because they're so cheap — and in some cases, even free.



This is true on some level, but for the best page builders, you still have to pay.



Yes, some websites are free as long as you buy your own domain (which, of course, costs money). Some websites are free without a domain, but your URL will look unprofessional and you won't have as many options as you would with a paid page builder.



Often, page builders hide their true costs behind subscriptions to appear cheaper. If you add up the money you'd spend every month on the highest-quality page builder you could find, would it be much more affordable than just hiring a pro?



They Come with Compatibility Challenges



So you've found the perfect page theme or plugin, and you're ready to use it on your website. When you try, however, it doesn't work at all, or it completely breaks the page.



Page builders often come with compatibility problems, limiting your options. While it may appear that you have countless themes and plugins available to make your website truly unique, the reality may be that only a fraction of those will work for your site.



It's Time to Move Past Page Builders



Let's face it — page builders suck. They look cheap and convenient on the surface, but at the end of the day, if you want a unique website to represent your brand, you can't cut corners. A page builder may be an okay starting point, but it will hold your brand back.



If you want a professional website, you need a professional web development team. That's why we're here!



At Pixaura, our team can help you with web design, SEO, and so much more. Take your website to the next level.&nbsp;Contact us&nbsp;so we can start working together on your project.

# Should You Use ChatGPT?

Full Content:
Although just recently released, ChatGPT may be growing faster than any other website or app in history. Believe it or not, this incredible technology already has over&nbsp;100 million active users.



That's unprecedented growth — so there has to be some benefit to using ChatGPT, right? Let's find out!



How ChatGPT Works



ChatGPT is a popular app created by OpenAI. It uses artificial intelligence built around the GPT language models, allowing it to answer questions, draft emails, write copy, carry a conversation, and so much more.



For more niche examples, it can even explain code in different programming languages (HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.), or the opposite (language to code). All of these functions are based solely on the language you feed into it and the vast information available to it across the web.



For example, if you say: "tell me about the Vanderbilt family history", it can do just that. It will then pull information from various sources on the Vanderbilt family and give you a detailed compilation of the information it uncovers.



At least, the app tries to carry out these functions accurately, but this doesn't always work in effect. So, is it actually useful for everyday life?



Most Useful Applications For ChatGPT



ChatGPT has plenty of applications that nearly anyone can use. Here are a few examples that may apply to you.



Write a Cover Letter



Do we suggest relying entirely on AI to write your cover letters for jobs you want? No.



Do we suggest using it as a starting point when writing cover letters for jobs you want? Absolutely.



ChatGPT can help you begin a cover letter following the desired outline, highlighting the strengths you offer, and using a professional tone. From there, you can edit and improve upon its creation.



Cover letters are daunting for many job applicants, but there's one challenge you may not realize: AI is already reading it first! If your cover letter and resume don't highlight the qualifications the AI was programmed to see, then a human may never see your application.



Create Web Content



ChatGPT and similar chatbots are revolutionizing the copy and content we are seeing on websites today. Some experts suggest that&nbsp;90% of web content&nbsp;will be AI-generated by 2025 — a staggering change.



No matter what anyone tells you, don't think that it is enough to get past Google or your users, both of whom are becoming better at spotting AI content.



However, AI can be a great starting point to expand upon. ChatGPT can give you plenty of great information when searching for new content to add to your website or blog.



Still, you will need to correct this content, give it voice, and make it fit your brand. Otherwise, you're limiting your&nbsp;SEO strategy from the start.



Generate Brand and Product Names



Have you ever had that problem where you can point out an existing brand name and think of a better one for it, but when it's time to come up with your own, you go blank? Us too.



Well, if you want to generate new ideas or concepts for your brand items, company, band, or whatever else you want, ask ChatGPT to give you some inspiration.



Remember, it's a free tool and there are currently no intellectual property rights over what it generates. Steal away!



Draft Marketing Copy



Ads, emails, social media posts, and blog content. No matter what you're looking for, tell ChatGPT and get some quality material to begin your campaign.



Again, it's a tool, not a finished product. However, ChatGPT and other chatbots can work as a great starting point. You'll need to ensure it fits your&nbsp;brand strategy, but it's a great launching pad.



Should You Try ChatGPT?



Knowing how ChatGPT works and some of its practical applications, should you consider using ChatGPT? Absolutely. Almost everyone can benefit from it in some way, whether you're a business owner, a student, a job hunter, and more.



However, keep in mind there are aspects of being human that machines can't imitate. Therefore, it's important to remember that it's a tool to help you reach your goals, not a skip button.



Stay up to date with our latest tips, and don't hesitate to&nbsp;contact us&nbsp;with any questions or for help with your marketing strategy!

# Expand Your Reach with Instagram Reels

Instagram is a popular social media platform with&nbsp;over two billion active monthly users. It is the fourth most popular social media app globally, generating an estimated 45 percent of Facebook’s total revenue. With its ever-evolving features and massive reach, Instagram offers businesses an increasingly powerful platform for marketing and advertising.



A recent addition to the platform — Instagram Reels — are quick, entertaining and creative, and have the potential to quickly engage audiences and help businesses reach new audiences.



Reels vs. Posts



Let's jump right to effectiveness, then we'll circle back to the basics of what you need to know.



We created an identical reel and post for a client — same visual content, same hashtags.




400 non-followers saw the post, total.



The Reel had 3000 views in the first hour.




The results are clear — Reels are a winning strategy!



What are Instagram Reels?



Instagram Reels are short videos available through the platform for users and brands to promote content or communicate with their followers. These Reels differ from the standard&nbsp;Instagram Stories&nbsp;feature because Reels don’t automatically disappear after 24 hours. Like a typical Instagram post, Reels only disappear if you remove them from your page.



Reels are becoming increasingly important for businesses and marketers for expanding reach and achieving higher engagement. Reels are typically more effective than other Instagram marketing tools, as they are more likely to be recommended to users who don’t follow your page.







How Long Can Instagram Reels Be?



Instagram Reels last up to 90 seconds when recorded in-app — or up to 15 minutes outside the app. While keeping an audience’s attention with a short Reel might be more accessible, you should consider longer Reels if your content would require multiple parts when split into shorter videos.



How to Get Started



Making an Instagram Reel for your brand is practical, simple, and fun. Here's how you can get started:




Determine the concept you want for your campaign, and storyboard to prepare for filming.



Open the Instagram app and tap the plus icon at the top of your page.



Select the Reel option, which allows you to begin recording or uploading your video.



Edit your Instagram Reel using various in-app features. Tools can alter audio, add filters, crop the visuals, shorten the clip, change the speed, and many other valuable assets.



Tap the "next" button, then adjust the settings for your Reel if necessary.



Add a caption and any other details, then post!




Top Tips for Making an Effective Instagram Reel



Creating an effective Instagram Reel that boosts engagement requires planning and creative thinking. Additionally, you can improve your Reel by considering some of the following tips:




Keep it short: Reels recorded in-app cannot exceed 90 seconds, but typically shorter is better. A concise and straight-to-the-point Reel is more likely to be viewed all the way through by your audience.



Use music: Music can add energy and emotion to your Reel, engaging your audience.



Use effects: Draw attention and make your Reel stand out. 



Be creative: Reels should be entertaining and eye-catching. You only have a short window of time to catch an individual’s attention, and the more creative your content, the more likely it is that a user will stop scrolling and watch.



Utilize hashtags: Hashtags can help you reach a wider audience, so include them whenever possible.








Can You Boost Reels on Instagram?



Yes, you can absolutely boost your Instagram Reels! This is a great way to get in front of a larger audience and increase the reach of your Reel. To boost your content,&nbsp;take the following steps:




On your profile, select the Reel that you want to expose to a broader audience.



Below the selected Reel, tap the “boost” option.



Describe the details of your ad by selecting a Goal, Audience, Budget, and Duration.



After filling in these details, tap on the “next” button.



To finish your ad, tap the “boost Reel” option under “Review your ad.”




The Benefits of Using Instagram Reels



Some of the numerous benefits to your brand include the following:




Instagram’s algorithm favors Reels.



Even on a budget, Reels can effectively promote your brand.



Reels can help you save time creating marketing content.



Reels can place your brand on Instagram’s explore page.



Instagram Reels can be repurposed across for other social media platforms.



Consumers want to engage in relatable and relevant content from the brands they purchase from - Reels accomplish this.



Reels allow brands to demonstrate their content and services in a fun, digestible way.



Reels can boost brand awareness because of their broad reach and ability to showcase products, services, and promotions consumers might not learn about otherwise.



You can reach new, untapped audiences and potential customers with Reels, especially when using hashtags and location tags.

76% of consumers who perform a local search on their smartphones visit a physical location within 24 hours. Sounds impressive, right? What if I told you that users reached with geofencing marketing often visit in even less time?



If you want to reach more customers and increase the chance they'll visit your business, geofencing marketing may be the answer. 



What Is Geofencing Marketing?



Geofencing marketing is a mobile marketing strategy that is based on a physical location. 



With this type of programmatic advertising, a local business will set up virtual boundaries, and when someone with a mobile device crosses into them, they'll receive a push notification or see an ad. This can be a great way for a local business with a physical retail location to successfully advertise a brand, products, services, or special deals.



Also known as geofencing advertising, this type of marketing is distinct from other methods. It occurs in close proximity to a business location and reaches a customer directly through a mobile device.



Compared to other media, geofencing marketing improves the odds of consumers visiting you, as you know they will already be near your business when targeted. The timeliness of a special reminder or offer on their smartphone or device could make all the difference.



Benefits of Geofencing Marketing



While we've discussed this a bit already, let's take a closer look at the benefits of utilizing geofencing marketing strategies. 



Great Timing



This might be *THE* major advantage of geofencing marketing.



Marketing messages to potential customers — in the designated area and in the ideal location — make it much more likely they'll stop in immediately.



Other types of ads require a lot more effort for a person to make their way to your business location.



Targeted Advertising



While digital advertising is more targeted than traditional ads, it still leaves a lot to be desired. You're likely already targeting cities, regions, or countries with other types of advertising.



In the case of geofencing marketing, anyone who sees your notification will be in an even more specific area. This kind of targeting can allow for some great possibilities when it comes to engaging consumers and marketing products and services to them.



Budget-Friendly



Because geofencing advertising reaches a very specific set of people in a small area, it can be more cost-effective. You won't waste your marketing budget on people who are unlikely to visit your business location.



Marketing Options



The flexibility of geofencing marketing allows it to be used in a variety of ways to bolster your overall marketing strategy.



The particulars of your geofence can easily be adapted to your needs. This includes the location, the days of the week, times of the day your ads are shown, and more. You can set a geofence to show only inside of your business, within a certain radius, or even near competing businesses.



Building Your Geofencing Marketing Strategy



To make the most of your geofencing marketing strategy, you'll want to keep these things in mind:



Know Your Audience



As with any marketing campaign, consider your audience carefully. What will resonate with your audience? What solutions does your business offer them? Your push notifications should be relevant to their needs.



It may also be helpful to segment your audience and measure the performance of different groups.



The location you choose for your geofence is critical, but is also impacted by user patterns. You'll want to carefully consider the behavior of your audience in nearby areas, which routes they travel in the area and where they are likely to spend time before visiting your business.



Use CTAs



While a simple geofencing advertisement alone can be helpful, it will be more impactful if you include a call to action (CTA). CTAs help direct your audience and increase their chances of taking an action — such as visiting your store or coming to see a particular product.



Providing something of value, such as a discount or coupon, may further compel a customer to come see you.



Optimize Your Campaign



Finally, make sure that you don't just "set it and forget it" when it comes to your geofencing campaign. Track your results and make adjustments — then rinse and repeat.



By tweaking the ad copy, changing the geofence location, and keeping close track of the data, your campaign will undoubtedly be a success.



Understanding How Geofencing Marketing Works



If you want to get more local customers for your business, consider using geofencing marketing. Timing is everything when it comes to great advertising, and setting up a geofence campaign can help you reach your customers at the perfect time.

# 5 Reasons to Have a Business Blog

A business blog is more than just a place to share a bit of your expertise. It can serve to improve your digital presence, build your brand, and help your business get more customers than ever before. In fact, a business blog can increase website traffic by 55%! If you haven't done any blogging for your business already, it's not too late to start.



Here are the 5 top reasons why you need a business blog:



1. You'll Drive Traffic to Your Website



One reason to create and maintain a business blog is that doing so will improve&nbsp;search engine optimization&nbsp;(SEO) and drive more traffic to your website. Creating useful blog content provides a way to add important keywords to your website and also provides valuable information to your target audience and customers.



When you write useful content — and do it consistently — Google picks up on this. As a result, your rankings improve and you'll see more targeted search traffic to your website.



2. You'll Improve Other Marketing Channels



A business blog can strengthen channels where you already communicate with customers and clients.



For example, you can use a blog post to grow your email list and collect email addresses with the help of a lead magnet. You can also share your blogs on social media, newsletters, and other marketing channels.



By linking different marketing channels together, you'll build a stronger online presence for your business.



3. You'll Get New Customers



Attracting people to your blog is a solid step towards earning a new customer. When using the right keywords and writing about the right topics, you can attract new customers to your blog who will learn about your business for the first time.



Your blog post should use calls to action (CTAs) to collect email addresses, direct users to service pages, or give them an easy way to get in touch with you.



4. You'll Build More Brand Loyalty



In addition to attracting new customers, a company blog can also strengthen your connection with current customers. A blog can give your previous clients and customers useful information that relates to your industry.



If your customers become regular readers of your blog, your business will stay on their radar, and hopefully grow more loyal to your business as a result.



5. You'll Become an Authority in Your Industry



A blog is a great way to establish authority in your field and demonstrate your deep knowledge.



Establishing your expertise builds trust with your customers, and they'll be more likely to choose your business over a competitor. Additionally, you may also attract better partnerships and show your expertise to other industry professionals.



What are You Waiting for? Launch a Business Blog!



If you want to get more customers through digital marketing, consider launching a business blog. Posting useful content consistently can help you gain more website traffic, prove your authority, and build better connections with potential and current customers.

Just over 60 percent of small businesses have a website, a powerful tool that can set your business apart. That's especially true if you use Local SEO to your advantage.



So, how do you use search engine optimization in a way that sets you apart from the rest of the pack?



Location, Location, Location



This is, and will always be, priority #1. It's super important to get your business listed on map features so when people are looking for services near them, you'll come up.



Creating a&nbsp;Google My Business&nbsp;profile is one way you can ensure the internet knows where your business is and that consumers can come find it. But, ensure that all the information on your profile is correct, so that no one gets lost.



You might want to take other measures to ensure that you pop up on other map apps, too. For example, Apple Maps might have a different process than Google Maps does.&nbsp;



Unique Local SEO Ideas 



1. Look At What's Trending



One great way to increase your business SEO is to use local happenings to your advantage. Look at popular events coming up, and work on your&nbsp;local SEO&nbsp;content. Keep an eye out for memes or other viral moments relevant to your community.



Of course, this will require you to keep a careful eye on what's online. You might not have a lot of time. That's where an SEO-focused agency can help you out. They'll help you understand how to generate SEO content for social media or your website that will truly help your business succeed.&nbsp;



2. Ask Around



You can also use real-life relationships to take your SEO to the next level. If you have relationships with related businesses, you can work together to share each other's content — boosting exposure for both of you.



You can create a social media crossover, where you take over each other's pages, or have your social media profiles share and interact online.



3. Use Your Location To Your Advantage



When you're looking into&nbsp;digital marketing options, you might have heard that adding a blog section to your website is helpful. That's particularly true when it comes to local search engine optimization.



You can craft blog articles catered to your area, full of keywords that will bring in the audiences you need. You can also use guest posts - posts on other sites with links back to your services.



People who are interested in the topic of the article will hopefully click on these links to your site. They might even share the posts you create, bringing more people into your business.

Full Content:
Every day, there are more than&nbsp;8.5 billion Google searches. If you aren't taking advantage of everything that Google search has to offer your business, you may be missing out on a lot of organic traffic.



Not only should you be aiming to improve your search rankings through SEO techniques, but you can try to appear in SERP features more often as well. Taking these featured spots in search results can help your website stand out and attract many more visitors.



Let's talk about some of the available SERP features.



What Are SERP Features?



A search engine results page (SERP) feature is a special element on a Google search results page. This element provides information beyond what is provided by a traditional organic search result and can be even more helpful to search engine users.



A traditional organic search result will include a title tag and a meta description, but a SERP feature may include images, videos, additional website links, and more. Improving&nbsp;search engine optimization&nbsp;(SEO) in order to get SERP features is a great idea that can allow your website's pages to stand out more in search results.



SERP Features to Pay Attention To



Keep these SERP features in mind:



1. Featured Snippets



One of the most popular SERP features is the featured snippet section. This section appears at the top of search results and displays an excerpt of page content along with an image.



This featured snippet comes from one of the pages that Google finds to be most relevant for a search query and can help users easily find the information they're looking for. To earn this SERP feature, consider adding more question-based headings to your content that are followed by short paragraphs.



2. Local 3-Packs



A local 3-pack is a SERP feature that relates to local searches. It includes a Google map along with a listing of several businesses in the area.



When local businesses appear in this spot, they're more likely to get customers to stop by. The chances of appearing here improve if you use&nbsp;local SEO techniques, starting with claiming your Google My Business (GMB) page.



3. Product Results



This type of SERP feature displays products at the top of the search results.



This section may appear if a user is searching for a specific product — Google will suggest various options from different online retailers. This can be a very useful SERP feature for online shops to target and you can easily rank in this section by using Google Ads.



4. Paid Search Ads



Also considered a SERP feature,&nbsp;paid search ads&nbsp;often show up alongside organic search results.



Paid search ads often look exactly like a regular organic search result, but with some alterations as well. They'll feature an "Ad" label and may link to multiple pages on a website, include a phone number, and more.



Running paid search ads is one of the best ways to get your business into search results quickly and effortlessly, but the privilege will cost you.



5. People Also Ask



In this section, Google lists some popular questions that relate to the search query. A user can easily click on one of these drop-down questions and can get a short answer to each of them.



To get featured in this section, it's a good idea to use more questions in headings and to create short content which answers the questions and specifically targets the related keywords.



6. Top Stories



The top stories box features a selection of news articles that relates the user's query. This section will typically include images, article headlines, and posting dates.



Appearing in this section is helpful for any site that posts content that relates to current events. If you spend time adding news to your website, you may find it in this section.



Image Pack



The Google Image Pack can appear in search engine results if Google determines a searcher may be looking for an image. This feature is simply a selection of images at the top of the SERP. 



These are the images that users would see if they were click over to the Google Images tab. Properly adding alt tags to images on your website makes it more likely that your site's images will appear in this SERP feature.



Video Results



As you would expect, this SERP feature will display the thumbnails of several relevant videos. Since so many web users are interested in watching videos these days, this can be a helpful search result.



To appear in this SERP feature more often, it's important to optimize any videos that you post to YouTube. Be sure to include relevant keywords in video titles, descriptions, and tags.



Knowledge Panel



This feature works similarly to an encyclopedia, displaying important information on a particular subject.



A Knowledge Panel is often located on the right-hand side of a SERP, and the information may come from Wikipedia. This information tends to appear when a user makes an informational search and may be used to define a person, a place, or a thing.



Making the Most of a Search Engine Results Page



You can improve your website traffic by understanding the various SERP features that are available. Working to improve your chances of appearing in these special sections can help you get more website visitors and will strengthen your business.

It's no secret that search engine optimization (SEO) is one effective way for increasing website traffic and boosting sales. Adding public relations (PR) to your SEO strategy can boost SEO’s effects even more. Yes, PR and SEO may be two different disciplines, but they share a lot of common ground. And when they are combined, the results can be truly powerful.



Let us share with you 10 key benefits of incorporating PR into your SEO strategy. Making the most of both disciplines can take your business to the next level.



10 Benefits of Including PR in Your SEO Strategy



1. Increased Brand Awareness and Visibility



Every business wants to be seen and heard by as many people as possible. After all, the more eyeballs you can get on your brand, the better. And that's where PR comes in.



Getting your business mentioned in the media makes you more visible and to a wider audience. This can drive more people to your website and improve your SEO.



2. Boosted Authority and Credibility



When your business is featured in the media, you become more credible and trustworthy in the eyes of potential customers. After all, if someone else is willing to write or talk about you, there must be something good about you, right? This increased authority and credibility does wonders for your SEO efforts, making it much easier for you to rank high in search results.



3. Improved Click-through Rates



If your brand is mentioned in an article or press release that ranks well on Google, searchers will be more likely to click on your listing over others because they've heard of you before. And with a higher click-through rate, you’ll move up the rankings.



4. More Backlinks



Quality backlinks from high-authority websites are essential for good SEO. And one of the best ways to get quality backlinks is by getting placements on these websites through earned media coverage.



These placements can come in the form of articles, blog posts, infographics, or even just mentions in passing; as long as it's a reputable website, it will help improve your SEO.



5. Wider Social Media Reach



Social media plays a role in SEO, and one of the best ways to improve your social signals is by incorporating PR into your strategy. By posting news and press releases on your social media, you can reach a larger audience and get more people to interact with you, which will help your SEO.



6. Enhanced Customer Relationships



Good PR isn't just about generating media coverage; it's also about building and maintaining strong relationships with customers, both current and potential.



By engaging with customers and addressing their concerns publicly, you show that you care and are committed to providing them a great experience. This type of customer service not only improves customer satisfaction but will also result in more repeat business and positive online reviews — both of which are great for SEO.



7. Improved Competitive Advantage



Public relations can give you online and offline advantages over your rivals. By generating positive media coverage, you’re making it harder for your competitors to cut into your market share. This increased visibility can also help you attract more customers and boost your sales, further solidifying your position as the market leader.



8. Greater Customer Insights



PR can also provide valuable insights into your customers' wants, needs, and pain points. By monitoring your brand and industry mentions in the media, you can stay on top of trends and adjust your marketing and SEO strategy accordingly.



9. Reduced Marketing Costs



Done right, PR can be a very cost-effective marketing tool. In fact, it often costs less than traditional marketing methods like paid advertising. And because PR can generate long-term results, it provides a great return on investment (ROI) for businesses of all sizes. This makes it an ideal strategy for businesses on a tight budget.



10. Increased Sales



At the end of the day, every business wants to increase leads and sales. And while PR may not seem like a direct sales tool, it can actually be quite effective in driving sales. PR indirectly leads to&nbsp;more sales&nbsp;by driving more traffic to your site.



Takeaway



PR is a vital part of any marketing and&nbsp;SEO strategy. It can help improve your brand awareness and visibility, as well as your authority and credibility. It can also boost your click-through rates, backlinks, social signals, customer relationships, and competitive advantage. Moreover, it can provide you with valuable insights into your customers and help increase sales. Finally, it's a cost-effective marketing tool that provides a great ROI.



What are you waiting for? Start incorporating PR into your SEO strategy today and witness your business&nbsp;reach new heights!

# So, You’re Thinking About a “Rebrand,” huh?

Full Content:
What exactly does that mean to you and your stakeholders? 



Let’s do a quick thought exercise:




What is the first thing that comes to mind when you answer the question…why rebrand?



What level of changes are you considering?



Is this a brand tone, message, or product positioning exercise?&nbsp;



Is this a core mission, vision, or go-to-market level strategy?




In most cases, what organizations are looking to accomplish is really just an evolution of the brand.&nbsp; Usually, when the word “rebrand” is used by some brave soul at an organization, there is mass chaos, alarms go off in the Accounting department and the whole HAIR ON FIRE thing happens. “It’s too expensive,” and “we don’t have the time to commit to this” begin to be heard.&nbsp;



Further, if there’s a need to use this dramatic word in response to a change in the organization or market, chances are time is of the essence. So, why don’t we talk more so about the brand evolving into its next phase of life…responding to the changing marketplace? Evolution. Moving forward. Helping the brand to “live in the world today.” Not Chaos…which takes time to resolve and costs a lot of money to quell. In this way, there’s a real need to “rebrand” the very word “rebranding.”&nbsp;



Is It Worth It? What Are the Top 5 Benefits of ‘Brand Evolution’ (rebranding)?



There are a lot of great reasons to evolve a brand and reap positive outcomes from the effort, save that of famous rebranding flameouts…it usually works. Here are some top benefits that we have seen from working with our clients:



1. Brand Becomes More Contemporary



In many cases, “rebranding” has one simple goal:&nbsp; to keep your brand current. Whether it’s through a new look, feel or message, it’s critically important to appear as if the brand ‘lives’ in today’s world. Further, staying connected in various comms channels to real events in the customer’s life helps them identify with the brand.



2. Engaged With New Audiences



The biggest advantage to evolving your brand is the ability to reach new customers. When you focus on new products/aspects of your business and promote them, people will take notice. Rebranding can offer the stimulation your business needs to create new growth in a frantically changing marketplace.



3. Differentiated Messaging



Differentiating your brand shows potential clients that your services are unique—and that you’re the experts. At Pixaura, we use social listening and brand audit tools to understand where we can assimilate or dissimilate your message from the competitive landscape. An evolved brand stays active in the conversations that are happening at scale in your industry.



4. Showcase New Values



It’s hard to showcase how your company has grown when your branding doesn’t reflect that. If you’ve expanded to offer new products, grown to include more services, or set new goals for your business, around things like Social Impact or Community Involvement, then rebranding is a great way to show how your business is evolving.



5. It’s All About the Bottom Line



Evolving your brand will not only impact your overall inbound strategy, but it will bring your organization more awareness and ultimately a more filled pipeline to convert and close business. Reaching new potential clients, standing out from your competitors, showcasing your expertise, and expanding the influence and reach of your products and services are all effective ways to increase your profits just by evolving your brand.

# Website UX vs. Design

It's finally done! Your graphic designers have built a beautiful website for your business.



But now... no one is using it. So, what went wrong?



It's a common misconception that a visually-pleasing website will boost your business. In reality, using principles of UX (user experience) will optimize your website to perform better for your visitors.



Let's take a quick look at how accounting for website UX improves the development process, ultimately resulting in better user engagement.



What Is UX?



UX stands for user experience, and it is a field that centers on the holistic experience that a customer or user has using your product. UX designers don't just focus on the website's appearance; they also focus on how the site's functionality is or how intuitive and/or easy it is to use.



Designing for UX is a balancing act. UX designers must ensure your website is aesthetically pleasing, aligned with your brand's vision, easy to use, and fulfills its purpose.



What Can UX Do?



Consider the&nbsp;pain points of a clunky website. Perhaps the text is difficult to read, or there's too much fluff.



Maybe the design is bland and causes you to click away. Perhaps&nbsp;the pages load slowly, or the information isn't organized in a way that makes sense.



These are some of the factors that UX design considers to ensure the overall experience of using a webpage is a good one. UX designers and researchers truly study the website visitor. For example, they may rely on user feedback or conduct focus groups and surveys to improve the existing design. They'll take the website through stages of testing to find any pain points and fix them.



However, UX design isn't completely independent of looks. UX design also ensures that the website's visual aspect&nbsp;is both pleasing and functional.



Why Does UX Matter?



The functionality of your website significantly impacts how much users can interact with your business.&nbsp;



If a user cannot easily navigate your website or find the information they need, they're likely to click off and go somewhere else. Plus, if your website isn't&nbsp;optimized for a search engine, it may be possible that no one can find your website.



(Because it's buried under your competitors' links.)



A robust website will generate more business for your company and generally give your brand a stamp of professionalism. Your digital footprint reflects your brand, and having weak web pages isn't a good look.



There's a Difference Between Design and UX



In reality, web design vs. UX isn't a fair comparison, because design is one (important) aspect of UX. You're investing in future revenue growth and customer retention by employing UX principles for your company's website.&nbsp;

# Use Topical Authority to Boost Your SEO Visibility

You’ve always heard that good SEO requires keyword optimization and a focus on creating high-value links. However, since Google introduced&nbsp;Hummingbird in 2013, these methods have become less effective when used alone. The algorithm may, in fact, deem them to be spam.



In other words, SEO isn't a system you can game - you have to give people something valuable. If you try to trick Google into believing that what you’ve produced is good enough for them to rank it at the top of search results, Google’s algorithm will detect this pattern and lower your rankings.



This is where topical authority comes in. By focusing on a few topics and becoming the leading expert in those areas, you’ll see an increase in both search engine traffic and organic rankings.



What Is Topical Authority?



Topical authority is a metric that ranks websites according to the quality of information they offer. It can also be described as the depth of knowledge a website has on a particular subject.



For example, let’s say you manage a clothing website. Of course, creating content about women’s clothing would help with your SEO. But so would blogging about fall fashion and how to feel confident in what you wear.



That’s topical authority in a nutshell. You’re not just selling clothing. You’re becoming the most authoritative source of information on all things clothing.



Because people aren’t searching for one question all day, a website with topical authority is more likely to have content that answers their many questions and provides helpful resources. As such, Google will rank that website higher because it’s more useful overall.



The Characteristics of Topical Authority



In addition to relevance, topical authority involves originality. This means that while your content may be on a popular topic, it can’t be too similar to what other people write. Your website should cover your relevant topics in more depth than anyone else out there.



The content also needs to be credible. You can earn this by using facts, data, and statistics to back up your claims. Links from&nbsp;authoritative sites&nbsp;boost the credibility of your website as well.



As long as your posts relate to your niche and don’t appear to be copied from other websites, your website will gain authority.



How to Create Topical Authority



Consistently creating topics that your readers want to learn about, while incorporating important keywords, is the foundation for building topical authority in SEO. Find out what your target audience wants and create content that meets those needs. The “People also ask” section on Google is a great place to learn what other people are searching for.



When developing topically relevant content, make sure you’re using appropriate&nbsp;keywords in your title tags&nbsp;and metadata descriptions so they show up on search engines. If you do this right, it becomes much easier for people looking for information on your topics to find you!



Help Your Business Get Found



Now that you understand the relationship between topical authority and search engine rankings, it’s time to implement strategies for improving your website’s standing in organic searches. By hiring Pixaura to manage your company’s SEO, you can position yourself as an expert in your industry—and attract paying customers who are looking for someone with that expertise.



Contact us today&nbsp;so we can work together to create a content strategy that will help you build your online presence. We’ll take care of your digital marketing so that you have more time and energy to&nbsp;focus on running a business.

The Metaverse may sound straight from the pages of a sci-fi novel, but it’s quickly becoming a reality.



One huge indicator that the Metaverse is right in front of us was the social media giant&nbsp;Facebook rebranding itself as Meta.



But what exactly is the Metaverse? In this article, we dive deeper into what marketers should know about the Metaverse and how to best use it.



What is the Metaverse?



You may be familiar with the concept of the Metaverse, but it can be quite confusing at first.



Kristi Woolsey, the associate director at BCG Platinum, broke down the concept beautifully for Forbes. Simply put, the Metaverse is a combination of mixed and virtual realities that provide users with the ability to engage in real-time experiences over distance.



Currently, we have the foundational pieces for the Metaverse, but they are not yet connected. We already have multiple V.R. platforms, virtual currency, etc. but they all operate separately.



Now, you can own digital/ virtual objects, including cryptocurrency and NFTs. These recent advancements are driving the Metaverse and turning heads in its direction.



Metaverse Growth



The idea of a fully virtual world may have at one time seemed far-fetched. But the Metaverse is not a sci-fi dream or still hundreds of years away. On the contrary, the Metaverse is developing as we write.



Major brands are investing in the Metaverse and associated technologies. Meta&nbsp;CEO Mark Zuckerbuerg&nbsp;described Facebook's rebranding as “(our) focus will be to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities and grow businesses.”



Microsoft&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;gaming company Activision&nbsp;and stated its motivation was to “accelerate the growth in Microsoft’s gaming business across mobile, PC, console and cloud — providing building blocks for the metaverse.”



Additionally, Roblox launched Nikeland — a place to go hang out and try on Nike products with your avatar.



Currently, over&nbsp;400 million unique, active users&nbsp;access a Metaverse platform each month. According to Bloomberg analysts, the Metaverse market is predicted to grow to nearly&nbsp;$800 billion by 2024.



Factors of the Metaverse



As a virtual entity, the Metaverse is constantly changing and adapting. However, a few key characteristics distinguish it:




Self-contained



Virtual entities



Leverages human interface technology



Fully functional, including a fully functional digital economy (with crypto, NFTs, etc)



Decentralized, open, shred world




Why Does the Metaverse Matter for Marketing?



While this may sound pretty cool and fun, the connection with marketing isn't as obvious. What does this virtual reality realm have to do with business marketing?



Well, a ton.



The Metaverse provides new places and strategies for marketing and advertising. At its core, marketing is about connecting the target buyer to the product, at the right price, in the right place, through promotion.



While “The Four P’s” of marketing have stood the test of time, it’s evolved immensely alongside technology. For example:




Web 1.0 — Having a website with contact information became vital and standard for businesses.



Web 2.0 — Added a more social aspect and started to gather user history to personalize experiences. Omnichannel marketing and personalization became essential.



Web 3.0 — The Metaverse focuses on immersive experiences. Marketing will need to follow suit to thrive there.




Tips for Marketing in the Metaverse



Leveraging the Metaverse offers many benefits for businesses. In that world, you can engage with customers in immersive ways. Additionally, it’s a key location for reaching younger generations of consumers.



Using the Metaverse, you can create a completely unique world for your brand, reaching customers in a way far deeper than any image or video could. You can design a fully unique world to interact with your audience.



Here are some tips that can help you unlock this new marketing:



Focus on Experience



Metaverse marketing is all about creating a memorable experience for your customers. Embrace the future of virtual reality and design a unique, compelling, and immersive experience for your audience.



Connect to Real-Life Experiences



Craft your virtual experiences in connection with your brand's real-world products and experiences. This is the best way to bring your brand to life and boost brand awareness.



Engage with Communities



Don't just show up in a Metaverse community and start pushing ads. It’s not how the space, or the users, work. Instead, interact with current communities. Foster user-generated content and naturally integrate yourself in the space.



Leverage Native Advertising



One interesting way to spread brand awareness in the Metaverse is with native ads. You could place ads on virtual billboards or with virtual product placements. Some major brands have already begun to do this, including Coca-Cola and Samsung. 



Allow People to Try Your Product



Let people try out your product in augmented reality before they buy in person. Similarly to what Nike does with Nikeland, you can provide an experience for your customers that acts as a dry run for your products. Porsche and Hyundai have entered this arena with virtual viewing rooms and V.R. car tour events.



Start Small



Don’t dive head-first into the Metaverse just for the sake of being there. Take your time to craft a strong strategy that works for your brand. Start by testing your ideas with your audience, and examining the results. Implement what you learn before scaling.



Conclusion



Ultimately, the Metaverse is a form of new and immersive social media. It’s a new internet, and that means new marketing strategies. Now is the time to learn more about this developing technology and plan how your brand can best market in the space.



Leverage the strategies above to get your brand on the Metaverse early and efficiently. It will soon be a critical part of every successful marketing strategy.

As the business sector embraces digitalization, marketing strategies have also transformed to align with it. Despite that, the marketplace remains competitive. Stepping up your web marketing strategy is necessary to keep up with the increasingly competitive marketplace.



A quick Google search for the most effective digital marketing approaches will surely highlight the acronyms SEM and SEO. And in this article, we will learn why they're the key to winning your web marketing strategy. Let's get started with what SEM is all about.



Defining the concept of SEM



SEM is a marketing term that stands for Search Engine Marketing. It is the collection of tools, techniques, and strategies that optimize a website's visibility via search engines. Simply put, SEM is a web marketing strategy that aims to improve search engine rankings on Google and other similar sites. 



SEO and SEM: What’s the difference?



Both organic and paid results are covered in SEM. Most marketers, however, use SEM to refer solely to search engine advertising or paid results. To better grasp this concept, let's look at the two types of search results: Organic and Paid.




Organic results appear on search pages based on a search engine's algorithm. The algorithm determines which websites are most suited to answer a particular query. And each search engine may have different factors affecting their results. For instance, Google's algorithm prioritizes relevancy, quality (web content), and authority (links from other pages). Businesses then employ Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in their content that follows those factors to help them rank organically.



Paid results incur a cost, as the name implies. Advertisers must pay for each link they want to display. Basically, you'll need to buy ads in the search engines where you want your ad to appear, such as Google or Bing. This approach is also known as PPC (pay per click) or CPC (cost per click).




Many people get confused about the&nbsp;difference between SEO and SEM. So, we're here to help clear your mind about these terms. As mentioned, SEM is a broader domain that encompasses both paid and organic search methods. It is a strategy to boost the visibility of your websites, improving your Search Engine Results Page (SERP) performance. SERP is simply the page that appears when you submit a search query to Google, Yahoo!, or Bing. , as well as other search engines.



On the other hand, SEO's primary focus is on organic search results. It aims to boost your site's performance using Google or Bing's ranking algorithms through quality content. With SEO, you can optimize a website to draw traffic from search results automatically.



If we look at SEM as paid advertising or PPC. Here are some key differences you will notice:




Type of investment.&nbsp;With SEM, you will pay every time your ad gets clicks. Meanwhile, SEO work needs an initial investment of time, effort, and budget.



Position&nbsp;your website will occupy in SERP. Ads usually occupy a band to the top, while organic search results fill the center space.



Type of content. Quality content, typically in longer formats, is the foundation of SEO. On the other hand, SEM uses ads with a limited number of characters and landing pages designed to have the most significant impact.



Results period. While SEM can produce benefits quickly, results in SEO usually take longer.




The Importance of SEM to your Business



There are many benefits SEM can offer for your brand. For instance, it increases brand awareness and visibility by boosting your online presence. As a result, this generates online leads and increases traffic, which gives you more sales and revenues. Similarly, you can supply visitors with unique information that they may not be able to get elsewhere. This helps build your brand's reputation, credibility, and trust for your audience.



Since SEM covers both SEO and PPC, business owners often wonder which is a better marketing investment. However, SEM isn't so much about which strategy is better as it is about which is more suited to your current situation and budget. Investing in organic and paid search strategies is especially worthwhile when done concurrently.



Many businesses start with SEO as it is often less expensive than other marketing techniques. And according to&nbsp;research in 2018, 49% of marketers worldwide claim that SEO provides the highest ROI. With some basic research and website abilities, you can even do some elements of SEO on your own. Furthermore, traffic derived straight from organic search is free, whereas traffic derived from PPC incurs a cost per click.



Working on quality SEO can help you rise in the SERPs when you demonstrate to search engines that your site should rank for relevant keywords that accurately describe your items. Organic SEO surely takes time, but as you create a favorable reputation and keyword growth, traffic should automatically improve and become more consistent.



Doing paid advertising alongside SEO will increase the chances of people learning about and supporting your brand. More than just getting the top-front page on SERPs, you'll also be able to generate conversions and measure your ads' effectiveness. Moreover, paid ads don't need a substantial initial investment since they only charge you when your ad is clicked, so it's a good choice for any business.



The Bottom Line



Combining SEO and PPC — in this case, SEM — gives you more chances of getting discovered. More than creating an email list&nbsp;and generating leads, integrating SEM will get you on top of your competitors. People use search engines for queries, and seeing your website there will help boost traffic to your website. Just remember to&nbsp;track important Google Analytics metrics&nbsp;to succeed in winning your web marketing strategy.

88% of consumers&nbsp;say that authenticity is important in a business. But how exactly do you communicate your bona fides and make customers feel valued when they shop with you or use your services?



The answer is branding. It&nbsp;can help a company grow and retain a solid, loyal customer base.



What Is Branding?



Branding is the creation of an identity for a business. Basically, your logo,&nbsp;your design, your voice, and your message all set the tone for your brand and come together to shape it, so you should think of each of these elements very deliberately.



But brand strategy goes beyond that though. Your customer service, your products, and pretty much every other aspect of your company will all help to shape your perception. Branding is part of everything — even if you're not intentionally doing it, it's still happening.



It's important to consciously think about it and shape the vision you want people to have of your business.



Why Is Branding Important?



If you don't actively think about branding benefits and let an unconscious image shape, it may not be a good one. You need to put effort in to ensure consumers have the right idea about your business, and what you stand for.



Good customer service, a visually striking logo, and a memorable name can all help you stand out, but consider other things too. For example,&nbsp;two-thirds of people&nbsp;would boycott a brand because of a social or political position — but the same study says they still want them to be honest about those positions.



Therefore, you need to think about the kind of customer you want and target them by being candid about the matters you truly believe in, especially if they're relevant to your service.



Branding Tips



To build a successful brand, here are a few things you can do:




Make sure your visuals are all memorable, clear, and accessible — especially on your website



Have a strong message and clear promise about what you aim to deliver



Stay authentic — if you stand for something socially, stick to it



Prioritize treating your customers well 



Ask for feedback




If you do all of these things, you'll be well on your way to creating a strong brand — but the best advice is always to be genuine.



Build Your Brand



It's important to build your brand consciously and mindfully. When people see your company name or someone asks for a recommendation, you want a strong record behind you of honesty, integrity, and good services and products. Making an effort to achieve these things will set you apart from the competition.

# Small Businesses Need Big Websites

20% of new small businesses&nbsp;fail in the first two years of being open!! And that statistic rises to 45% after five years.



The main reason is saturated markets. More and more people are getting the opportunity to start their own businesses, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd.



One great way to do that is with a professional, high-quality website.



If you're not convinced, here are the main reasons small businesses need great websites to stand out.



Credibility and Professionalism



Having a custom website brings credibility and professionalism to your business. New research&nbsp;suggests you have only 27 seconds&nbsp;to make a good first impression on a potential client. For many customers, the first interaction they have with your business is often the website.



A clean design, a tone that balances friendliness and professionalism, and memorable imagery are all quick ways to stand out against the competition and ensure consumers keep you in mind when it comes to making a purchase or soliciting a service.



It's the Best Way of Laying Out Information



Gone are the days when a consumer might need to call a company with a list of questions. Websites provide fast, convenient ways for them to access everything they might need.



Businesses can lay out their services, location, pricing, contact information and more in an easily obtainable format.



Before websites, it was much more difficult time getting that information across. Businesses had to rely on billboards or the distribution of physical brochures.



The emergence of the internet means it's much easier to reach a wider audience, and it's just another reason not to sleep on&nbsp;designing a website.



It Brings People to You Through Search Engines



One of the main benefits of a website is another way it makes your business accessible to a wider audience — search engine optimization (SEO).&nbsp;



With a web design that's clean, fast-loading, and easy to read, you open up a lot of doors. Google's algorithm loves websites that have the customer in mind. A highly functional site, combined with proper SEO architecture, can do wonders for boosting you in Google search results, soliciting more clicks from curious customers.



With strategic SEO, when people search for a product or service you offer, they're more likely to come across your website than competitors.



There exists a variety of other SEO tactics you can employ to cement your place in Google's rankings, like deploying keywords throughout your website that match a consumer's potential search terms.



Successful Small Businesses Need a Great Website



In the age of digital marketing, a great website is not optional for anyone, even small businesses. At least, not the kind of small businesses that want to beat the competition. Professional websites can secure a credible and professional image and help you reach a wider audience, which brings more potential consumers to your product or service.&nbsp;



Need help creating an amazing website and implementing some success tactics?&nbsp;Contact us today&nbsp;at Pixaura for a free digital strategy consultation.

A recent survey found that&nbsp;70 percent of businesses&nbsp;are increasing their marketing efforts through email newsletters. Professional newsletters allow you to incorporate valuable information about your business or service at a low cost.&nbsp;



Newsletter can be optimized in several ways - let's talk about how you can create a fabulous email newsletter for your business.



Make Your Newsletter Mobile Friendly



With more people using smartphones than ever, it's essential to incorporate mobile-friendly newsletter options. Newsletter optimization for smartphones will allow more people to read about your business. You want newsletters to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.&nbsp;



For this to work, you need a clean, sophisticated template for your email newsletter. Avoid jumbled text and photos that may not load properly.&nbsp;



Create a Great Subject Line



As the old saying goes, 'you never get a second chance to make a first impression.' Creating an attention-grabbing headline allows you to capture the immediate attention of the person receiving the email.



Start with developing a relevant message. Be sure when you are writing the subject line, you are 'teasing' its contents. The goal is to get people to keep reading!



Many marketing companies use A/B testing, which allows you to send different types of newsletters to diverse audiences. This is a great way to determine&nbsp;which subject lines work best.&nbsp;



Use an Engaging Call to Action



Regardless of the types of newsletters you send, use a call to action at the end. List contact information for your business, or give readers another reason why to try your product or service.&nbsp;The goal of your newsletter may be staying top of mind, but ensure you aren't giving away conversion opportunities.



When in Doubt, Hire a Professional



Do you want an excellent look for your email newsletter? A professional company will give you great newsletter options and newsletter ideas. You will get quality advice on the types of newsletters you should produce for your&nbsp;customers and clients.



Experts will help with professional newsletter design, including layout, font size, pictures, content, and frequency. You will get advice on newsletter optimization for social media, sales, brand recognition and more.



Working with a professional team will help develop insight and provide tips you never considered. They can also critique your current product strategy and guide a path for improvement.&nbsp;



Ways to Optimize Your Email Newsletter



Several ways to optimize your email newsletter include hiring a professional, using a mobile-friendly format, and creating great subject lines. Moreover, use a call to action that makes people contact you!



Professional newsletter options cost less than you think. Many small businesses spend about&nbsp;one percent of their annual budget on marketing. Regardless of&nbsp;how much you spend, experts can work with you on different newsletter options to fit your needs.

A/B Testing: What is it?



A/B testing, a.k.a. "split testing," is a highly effective way to pick the best version of a website, app or marketing strategy. When making important business decisions, it is important to have tangible evidence to point business owners in the right direction.



A/B testing pre-dates the creation of&nbsp;websites&nbsp;and apps, having first been implemented in farming, medicine and other industries. Business owners and marketers alike now utilize the strategy to improve sales and overall customer satisfaction. At its core, A/B testing compares two different versions of the same concept, whether it be two versions of a web design layout, two versions of app content, or something else entirely. A/B testing helps determine which version is the "superior" one, with superiority being defined by the goals of those conducting the A/B test. 



Generally, apps and&nbsp;websites&nbsp;are ideal for A/B&nbsp;testing as they record large amounts of data in a short period of time.



How A/B Testing Works



The first step to conducting an A/B&nbsp;test in marketing is choosing which element to test. The chosen element may be something as small as font size, or as large as the entire layout of a website. Then, you must create the two versions of that element to compare. 




Next, you need to define a metric of success. Success may be determined by a multitude of factors: time spent on an app or website, frequency of checking an app or website, probability of purchasing a product from an app or website and the number of "clicks" on a certain element are some common metrics of success that marketers use. Much of this data is easily accessible using app or website&nbsp;analytics. 



Marketers randomly pick two groups, and assign one of the elements to each group. From there, marketers take a look at&nbsp;analytics&nbsp;and determine which version of the element achieves more desirable results. Frequently, the "better" version of the element is then implemented full-time.&nbsp;




Best Practices



Choosing potential metrics of success is one of the most important steps in the A/B&nbsp;testing process. It is best to start with broad business goals (such as increasing sales). Then narrow down those broad goals to tangible results (such as website traffic).



Terminology and Scope of A/B Testing



The percentage of users who engage in the desired behavior is the "conversion rate." So, if the metric of success is the number of clicks on a specific button, and 40 out of 100 users in one group click on that button, that is a 40% conversion rate. The conversion rate is the number that marketers are mostly concerned with in A/B&nbsp;testing, but it is also important to take into account the sample size and margin of error. If a control group has a 40% conversion rate, and the variation group has a 50% conversion rate, this is a "10% lift" difference. Lift just refers to the percent difference in conversion rates between the two groups.



While marketers frequently like to conduct A/B testing for a variety of elements, sometimes more than one at a time, the most significant results will arise when only changing one or two independent variables. If the test changes the layout, font size, button colors and text color, then it is difficult to know which specific element or elements created the differences. Changing elements one at a time may mean running a larger number of tests overall, but it makes the results much easier to interpret.

If the test changes the layout, font size, button colors and text color, then it is difficult to know which specific element or elements the differences can be attributed to. Changing elements one at a time may mean running a larger number of tests overall, but it makes the results much easier to interpret.




Group Randomization and External Factors



When assigning groups, it is crucial to assign them randomly to avoid bias in the results. One potential problem to consider is any differentiation between mobile and desktop users when testing an app or website. It is entirely possible that people spend longer on a desktop device than a mobile one, which could affect results. Therefore, it is best practice to ensure that neither group has significantly more desktop or mobile users than the other. This practice is known as "blocking."&nbsp;



Though randomization helps eliminate contributing factors, it is still important to consider if any external factors affected the data. Something as insignificant as the time of year could skew results. Conducting large A/B&nbsp;tests frequently can help control for external factors.



Benefits of A/B Testing



While the general goal is increasing outreach and sales, A/B&nbsp;testing can improve a business in many ways. A/B testing may be used to determine likelihood of making a purchase, but can also be extended to determine likelihood of subscribing to a newsletter or clicking on an add. It may measure the amount of traffic a website generates, or the amount of time users spend on an app. It is these small differences that lead to a greater difference in bottom line sales.&nbsp;



With technology providing more analytics&nbsp;than ever, it is easier than ever to leverage this insight to promote business growth. While A/B testing for slight changes may seem like overkill, it is so easy to track there is no reason not to... Especially if it could gain customers and increase sales.

Every successful marketing campaign begins with a great marketing story. That might sound daunting, but not if you use proven story elements. Read on to learn how to reach your goals with these five strategies.



1. Create A Hero



Every great tale needs something to identify with the reader. Yet, when involving people in your marketing stories, the hero should be them! Make your customer the most important aspect of your story.



Many marketing businesses online make their stories about the company or product. Some turn their product into heroes that save the day with their superpower qualities. But if you want your audience to relate to the story, they need to be at the center.&nbsp;



2. Give Your Hero A Goal



Your digital marketing strategy revolves around the path your hero will take. Your customer hero will need something to strive for in your story.



Begin by outlining the problem your hero faces. Then, show the reader where they stand today and how much better life will become if they reach their goal.



Your marketing story elements create conflict, which entices the reader to move forward. The goal is to transform the hero through the problem with your product's help.



3. Throw Up Roadblocks



Nothing creates conflict in a marketing story like obstacles. Define the issues standing in your hero's path to reaching their goal.



Make your hero fight for a successful conclusion. Ultimately, they will feel a sense of accomplishment in tackling the issue head-on.



The most compelling obstacles are generally psychological in nature. Solving an internal problem makes your marketing story goals more valuable to meet.



4. Bring In The Calvary



Of course, people in marketing stories are just like movie heroes. In many of the best scripts, a guardian angel swoops in to help your hero save the day. For example, George Bailey had Clarence in his corner when all looked lost in&nbsp;'It's A Wonderful Life'.



Your product becomes the gentle shove that propels your customer toward their goal. But remember, the mentor is always the unsung hero - and never takes center stage.



The most successful marketing story elements put the customer in the driver's seat. Your product or service is&nbsp;the capable assistant&nbsp;that encourages your hero at the right time.



5. Give Your Marketing Story Meaning



Marketing story elements use the same principles as movie story endings. Your customer, the hero, has solved the problem with your help. Yet, the hero also learned a valuable lesson. George Bailey learned life is worth living no matter what the circumstances.



The moral of your marketing story is integral to your digital marketing strategy. Your customer retains the information with a memorable solution.



Use these marketing story elements to draw your audience to your product, and&nbsp;let's tell your story together. Then, get&nbsp;even better results with our help by&nbsp;contacting&nbsp;us&nbsp;today.&nbsp;

When developing marketing campaigns, you might hear a lot about features vs benefits. One huge mistake people make in business marketing is blurring the lines between the two. There's actually a big difference, and understanding each (and how to use them) is key to a great campaign.



Features vs Benefits: What's the Difference?



Features are characteristics about the product or service. This might be simply what it does, or it may also include things that set it apart from the competition. 



A good example of this would be when thinking about headphones. Features would be a wireless bluetooth connection or noise cancellation. Selling features is important.&nbsp;



Selling benefits, however, is important too. Benefits are what those features actually do for the customer or client. Following the example of headphones, this might mean that you can walk a great distance away from the device and still hear the audio or that the cords won't get tangled up in your pocket.



Generally speaking, benefits should explain something that the purchaser would actually get out of the product rather than just something it has. Although the benefit is often inferred just from mentioning the feature, this doesn't mean that they're exactly the same (and you should never assume your audience knows the product as well as you do). 



Which to Focus On?



When writing copy, you might be wondering which your&nbsp;digital strategy&nbsp;should focus on — the features or the benefits? The truth is that despite a clear difference in definition, they're intertwined, and any good strategy includes both.



However, 85% of marketers believe that consumers want a personalized experience. That means not just telling them what the feature includes, but how it can help them. Giving plenty examples of the benefits of how it might improve their life (especially if they choose your product or service over the competition) is key to seeing them through to making that final purchase. 



A famous example: Don't sell the mattress, sell a better night's sleep.



If you have heavy competition, a little more focus on the features might be necessary though. You'll have to point out exactly why a customer should go with you rather than a bigger brand or name. That might mean putting emphasis on things that your competitors don't have.



Features and Benefits Are Both Important



When it comes to features vs. benefits and which to use, they both have their place in a digital marketing strategy. However, picking which one to use (or place more emphasis on) involves knowing your audience and the competition.



Do you need some business marketing help with features and benefits or another aspect of digital advertising?&nbsp;Contact us today&nbsp;and let's see what we can do for you.

# The Importance of First-Party Data

In 2022, quality marketing is essential for the success of any business. There are a lot of ways&nbsp;you can promote your&nbsp;company, but the most effective methods involve using the right insights.



By leveraging first-party data you can promote your brand more effectively and provide a better experience for your customers.



What Is First-Party Data?



First-party data is any data that's collected through direct interactions with customers. This can include a range of types of data:



Purchase historyEmail clickthroughsMobile-app dataWebsite activityMore



There are also multiple ways you can collect this data, including sales, support processes, subscriptions, website forms, etc. This is separate from second and third-party data, as these can be collected indirectly.



Why First-Party Data Is Important



First-party data is the most important data type a business can have, and that significance has grown in recent years. The increased use of the internet has affected the way customers make purchasing decisions. As a result, expectations about how brands treat their customers have grown.



Companies can provide more personalized experiences based on the data they gather. Website data can give your business better insights into the wants and needs of your customers, and you can tailor their online experience to fit them. It's very easy for customers to go to a search engine and look for competitors, so you don't want to give them a poor experience that might encourage that.



At the same time, customers will expect you to respect any data they provide. Because of this, it's important to store data securely and inform customers of if or how you'll use it.



A company that collects first-party data can use this data to assist marketing efforts -- without having to ask the customer. There is, however, an obligation to use this data responsibly and respectfully.



Uses of First-Party Data



One of the most common examples of first-party data usage is through personalized experiences. You can promote certain products to a customer based on their previous purchases. This allows customers to see things that they're more likely to be interested in.



You can also use first-party to create targeted advertising campaigns. Similarly to personalized experiences, you can cater ads to a customer based on previous purchases or other activities.



Through data analysis, you can examine customers' past activity and predict their future behavior. By observing typical patterns that people follow and web pages they view, you can get an idea of what a customer might be thinking about buying. This permits you to drive them towards a specific product or service.



You can also get insights into different customers and analyze them together to find&nbsp;individuals with similar traits. This will give you a better idea of what content on your site is working well and what isn't.



With this information, you can make changes to improve your&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;strategy and provide a better customer experience.



Your First-Party Data Strategy



Obtaining first-party data is one thing, but planning a strategy to utilize it is another. If you want to develop a strong first-party data strategy you would benefit from the assistance of a digital marketing agency like Pixaura. We can help with a range of marketing strategies and advertisement campaigns.

# What Marketing Spend Trends Reveal about Business Today

Businesses need marketing now more than ever --and statistics indicate they are aware of this. The annual marketing spend globally is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 7%. It’s predicted that the annual spending on marketing activities will hit $4.7 trillion by 2025 from $3.6 trillion in 2021.



Consumers today have a different approach to purchase decisions than they did a decade ago. Mobile phone and internet penetration rates are over 60% globally - up from 30% in 2010. In first world countries, it’s over 90%. Consumers today do not rely on just ads and sales pitches before making purchasing decisions. More than 80% of smartphone users search for credible and unbiased information before making purchase decisions. This is influencing marketing spend trends.



Customer-Centric Marketing



Consumers actively searching for information creates an opportunity for companies to grow their ROI on marketing spend. It’s the reason why marketing budgets are growing worldwide.



Significant portions of marketing budgets are going towards improving customer experiences. For instance, companies are sending out branded merchandise to clients on their birthdays to cultivate loyalty. Another example is improved customer support services via shortened wait times on queues and phone lines, introducing live chat support on websites and apps, and using social listening tools to respond to complaints or join worthy causes.



Content marketing continues to grow in importance as customers seek valuable information instead of just ads. Consistently published, high-quality content gives your brand traction, thus growing a following. It also builds customers’ trust in the brand as an authority in each sphere. Brands are investing heavily in written content, videos, infographics, and other forms of high-quality content.



Marketing Is Shaping Culture



Companies are aligning their brand cultures with customers’ values. There is no longer a divide between companies’ branding efforts and their corporate culture - they need to be congruent. For instance, Apple customers believe that their company produces the highest quality items in the various product categories they sell. The company hardly needs to say this through advertising, but it's clear in their new product line-ups every year.



Similarly, part of your marketing budget needs to go to branding activities that tell your company’s story. The marketing strategy needs to blend with the overall organizational strategic goals for the messaging to be authentic.



Innovation Needs Marketing



In a world where new industries are built at a rapid pace due to IoT, AI, and blockchain, go-to-market strategies are just as important as innovations themselves. Companies need to spend to match products with the right customers. Proper marketing allows technically inferior products to get better traction than superior products. Through marketing, businesses educate customers and break mental barriers by demonstrating how a product is a solution. 



Optimizing Your Marketing Spend



Traditional advertising is not dead. In fact, spending on advertising will surpass $1 trillion by 2026. However, companies can do more with their marketing budget to complement advertising efforts. Proper customer experiences make people more receptive to advertising messages. Similarly, content marketing builds trust in a brand.  If your organization is seeking to optimize its marketing spend during campaigns, reach out to us for a free consultative meeting. We help brands plan and implement brand strategies and marketing strategies.

https://player.vimeo.com/video/586635352?h=46aca97393




What does "good" design look like and are there any instructions on creating it? Dieter Rams, a legendary industrial designer, whose "less but better" approach inspired a generation of products, is famed for writing the Ten Principles of Good Design.



Here is a brief overview:




Good design is innovative.



Good design makes a product useful.



Good design is aesthetic.



Good design makes a product understandable.



Good design is unobtrusive.



Good design is honest.



Good design is long-lasting.



Good design is thorough down to the last detail.





https://player.vimeo.com/video/289864035?h=808a3e6e03




Not so long ago Dieter Rams Ten Principles inspired many designers to follow these principles. At Pixuara, we also believe design follows these principles and we look forward to making good/clean, and effective designs for our clients. We use these principles for all of our design; websites, social media graphics, programmatic ads, print, motion, etc...  Here are some sites we use for Design Inspiration:

# Tiktok For Business: How To Use It To Boost Marketing

Full Content:
If your small or medium business is not using social media video marketing, you're missing out on a huge chunk of lead capturing, spreading brand awareness, and sales enhancement. 



YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram are undoubtedly leading the way when it comes to social media video marketing, but the new kid on the block – TikTok – is massively growing by leaps and bounds.



What is TikTok?



TikTok is a short video app available on smartphones. TikTok videos generally range between 30 and 60 seconds, but they are presented using eye-catching filters, attractive graphics, trending music, and special effects. 



TikTok’s AI-enabled algorithm comes with recommendations for viewers based on what they have watched in the past and what they like. The same is followed on other major social media channels as well.



Why is TikTok so Famous?



Users find it easy to interface with TikTok and love discovering new content, which are often viral sensations. 



TikTok can help you enhance your business, reach a better target audience, increase your brand awareness, generate leads, and eventually bring them to your website, resulting in maximum conversions from leads to sales.



You can refer to the following stats and see how this platform reaches the masses and the classes in every nook and corner of the world:



TikTok has earned an estimated $4.6 billion in revenue in 2021, which is an increase of 142% since the previous year.1.2 billion monthly users were active on TikTok in the fourth quarter of 2021, and this figure is expected to increase to 1.5 billion by the end of 2022.TikTok has been installed on smartphones over 3 billion times. Just in January 2021, TikTok was downloaded 62 million times. In June 2020, TikTok was downloaded 87 million times worldwide, of which 7.5 million occurred in the United States.



TikTok for Business



Considering the above-mentioned TikTok stats, it is evident why businesses prefer this platform to conduct business. If you are looking for a platform to post your marketing-related videos, TikTok is the perfect place for it.



You can try different types of content on TikTok after researching your competitors. Identify your target audience and verify if the kind of consumers you are targeting are using TikTok.



You can make special videos specifically curated for TikTok. To enhance your business, you can indulge in various other kinds of videos like:



Create a recreational or behind-the-scene video



Make a video where you introduce your company, yourself, and your team. Add a theme song to this video and let it capture the essence of your firm.



You can also make a video of a tour of your workplace. Show them how you generate your products or services and how hard your team works.



Share inspiring stories



Don’t quickly indulge in sales videos. Instead, motivate and encourage your audience by telling them how you started your business, accomplished various hurdles in getting where you are now, dealt with failure, etc.



Don’t forget to show your philanthropic side



TikTok viewers don’t like typical sales or marketing videos. You need to smartly present your videos on TikTok to attract your target audience to your webpage or brand. 



If you are into charity, you must share it! Tell them about your business ethics and how you follow the path of honesty and integrity.



Highlight your products and services



TikTok is a wonderful platform to showcase your products and services. You can make interesting unboxing videos and provide resolutions for common problems users face. 



You can make time-lapse videos and encourage others to follow suit. Make tutorials or FAQ based videos and provide the answers your audience wants.



Use a compelling story



TikTok users are fun and creative, so don’t enter serious marketing mode while creating TikTok videos. 



Use an impressive storyboard and make sure your video has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.&nbsp;



Add catchy music to connect with your audience.



Use appropriate hashtags



If you want people to discover your content, you must use trending hashtags. Know what your audiences clicks on and keep a tab of relevant hashtags for your business.



Curate user-generated content



Create your video content and increase your brand awareness. It is a great way to showcase the latest deals, offers, and perks that your viewers can enjoy in your marketing campaign.



Viewers love testimonials, reviews and word-of-mouth feedback, so adding customer reviews is a great way to garner attention.



TikTok Ads for Business



You can now place business-related ads on TikTok. This is a great way to let prospects see your brand. There are four kinds of TikTok ads you can employ:



Brand takeover ads. If you make an exclusive offer on TikTok, you can link your ad to the landing page.Native ads can be seen between existing user content but can also be easily skipped by scrolling.Sponsored Hashtag Challenges promote the brand and increase engagement with the audience.Branded Lens is a filter that allows the audience to attach it to their video. The filter should speak about your brand and must resonate with your target group.



TikTok for Small Businesses



TikTok is a great tool for businesses to expose your brand to new prospects. The platform's users are enthusiastic about sharing content and typically open the application several times a day. 



You should understand that the audience is looking for creativity, fun, recreation, or entertainment. Strong sales or marketing perceptive videos may not hold much importance here.



So, before you indulge in video making, especially for TikTok, don't make pure sales videos. Instead, focus on the fun and creative aspects of video making. 



You can add humor, and a good string of music. Tell a story, motivate your audience, educate them, or simply share tips to attract and grow your followers.



Conclusion



TikTok no longer needs to prove its superiority. It has provided truly overwhelming competition to influential players in the industry, breaking records and gaining billions of users.&nbsp;



TikTok remains an important communication channel for all brands, and if you make the right video content, you can go viral and impact your audience.&nbsp;



From compelling hashtag trends to record-breaking perspectives, TikTok has successfully provided brands with enthusiastic engagement and interactive opportunities.

# Omnichannel Marketing 101: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?

It's been the case for years that retailers need to be online to survive, with online storefronts,&nbsp;social media research&nbsp;and marketing fundamental to doing business. Still, most consumers haven't made the jump to doing business only online yet. So for now, physical retail retains its relevancy.



However, the nature of how we conduct brick-and-mortar sales has begun to catch up with the times.



Until recently, shopping online and shopping in-person were two distinct experiences. But factors like COVID-19&nbsp;changing how shoppers make purchases&nbsp;have forced retail to evolve.



Omnichannel marketing has become a common term in discussions on how retailers can achieve a synthesis between these two shopping methods. But why is it important and how can it help you grow your business? To find out, let's start by defining our terms.



What Is Omnichannel Marketing?



There's never a shortage of new buzzwords in marketing, and omnichannel is only one of the more recent ones. And like many buzzwords, it tends to get thrown around even when the user doesn't quite understand what it means.



In brief, having an omnichannel marketing plan means that you've built an integrated consumer experience. Shoppers can move from digital channels like your app or website to a brick-and-mortar store with ease.



So suppose a potential buyer was researching your product online. But for whatever reason, they decide that they want to buy it in-person instead of through the app or the site. An omnichannel strategy creates the framework to make that purchase as simple as possible for them.



The Benefits of Omnichannel Marketing



Think about your own buying decision in your personal life. It's unlikely that you will only shop online or only shop in person. Instead, you probably use your smartphone to research products so you can make an informed purchase.



This can be something simple, like researching brands on your phone while you're at the grocery store. Or it could take the form of the mobile ordering services that became standard during the pandemic.



Whatever the case, it's a welcome convenience for the customer, and may offer a bevy of benefits for the retailer as well.



It can be a great tool for helping you to collect the most up-to-date data on customer buying decisions, for one. And since many customers still prefer to pay in cash whenever possible, it can be a means to help encourage in-person purchases and put a dent in&nbsp;high credit card service fees.



Is Omnichannel Marketing the Future?



"It's easy to see, but hard to foresee", Benjamin Franklin once quipped. And in that spirit, skeptics might dismiss omnichannel marketing as a mere fad.



But with the benefits it can provide to retailers and shoppers alike, there's little reason not to expect an omnichannel marketing strategy to become increasingly important to success.



But you don't need to navigate this new frontier alone. To see how you can integrate strategies like omnichannel marketing into your physical retail plan, find out how&nbsp;our digital strategy tools&nbsp;can help you plot a roadmap for your future.

# Google's Vicinity Update: What Does It Mean for You?

One of the essential things in running a business is making sure that people know about it. Marketing your product is so much easier nowadays because of the internet. With the help of search engines, your business can be visible to the market everywhere.



There are a lot of active search engines, but Google is still leading the market today. According to statistics, Google has&nbsp;3.5 billion searches&nbsp;per day -- or 1.2 trillion searches per year!



Last year, Google released a local algorithm update called Vicinity. As a result, many business owners are worrying about its effect on their search ranking.



Do you want to know how the Google Vicinity update can affect your business? Check out this guide and learn all about the newest Google update!



What Is Google Vicinity and Its Effects?



As mentioned before, Vicinity is the most significant Google update since 2017. Now, Google changed how distance affects search rankings on local search.



The latest update focuses on businesses closer to the local map. It helps small businesses to appear on&nbsp;local search&nbsp;more than well-established businesses.



The first thing you'll notice is the change in the local map layout. Previously a rectangle, it is now square and zoomed-in on the most relevant businesses nearby.



Using keywords is not as effective as before, although it did have a vital role in a previous update. Because of this, business owners need to re-strategize to maintain their visibility.



How to Make Out the Most of Google Vicinity?



Search rankings will decline if you rely on keywords. But don't worry, there are things that you can change to maintain a good search position.



First, make sure that your business information is up-to-date.&nbsp;List your business&nbsp;on Google and ensure that you have accurate and complete details. It will ensure that your business appears on local searches and stay relevant.



Next, include business hours during holidays and other events. Including when you open and close also helps in this new update. You can also include photos of your products, location, and service. It will help customers know more about your business and may improve your ranking.



Finally, do not forget to respond to inquiries by customers or&nbsp;reply to feedback. 



Do You Need Help in Optimizing Your Search Rankings?



The Vicinity update may have changed your search rankings, but it's not too late to come back to the top. Ensure that you follow Google's guidelines for businesses to maintain your online presence and keep your search ranking high.



This update may still have a few changes in the future, or Google may continue to update its algorithm. But, to adapt to these changing times, remember to update your Google listing.



Keeping your online presence and updating your profile can be hard in this digital era. If you need help creating strategies for improving your online presence,&nbsp;contact us! We will help you plan to engage people and make them click that buy button.

# What Social Media Usage Reveals About Your Client Base

In 2020, an estimated&nbsp;3.6 billion people&nbsp;used social media worldwide. With such a diverse pool of people to build a client base, social media marketing has become an essential tool for businesses.



But, how do you use social media marketing and customer trends effectively?



In this article, we discuss social media usage and its relation to marketing. We also discuss how analyzing customer behavior can help you grow your business. Continue reading to make the most of your data.&nbsp;



Why Social Media Marketing Is Essential



Social media marketing is an essential tool for both large and small businesses alike. It not only allows for direct engagement with your client base but also offers valuable insight that's hard to get elsewhere.



Social Media Usage



Approximately&nbsp;72% of Americans&nbsp;report using social media. This isn't sporadic usage either seeing that 7 in 10 users are on these platforms at least once per day. Frequent usage offers businesses consistent and ongoing data.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Interaction With Client Base



With regular use comes an opportunity to regularly interact with your client base. This type of interaction is unattainable through other methods of business marketing. Regular interaction is also expected amongst users.



Building Trust and Loyalty



Users often feel as though a brand is more accessible and relatable when they see this interaction. If consistent with interaction, social media marketing allows companies to build trust and brand loyalty. 



Understanding&nbsp;Your Client Base



Now that we've discussed how&nbsp;social media use is essential for businesses, how can you maximize its effectiveness? From&nbsp;customer trends to finding new opportunities, social media can help you grow your business.



What Consumers Want



Analyzing social media usage and&nbsp;customer trends can help you understand what consumers want from your brand. The key is to listen and learn to speak the same language. Without addressing these desires,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;hard to create loyalty.



Who Is Interacting with Your Brand



Learning which customers are interacting with your brand is just as important as analyzing customer behavior. Social media can help you not only generate leads but build lasting relationships with those leads.



How Your Brand Is Being Received



When analyzing engagement to learn how your content is performing, it's also important to consider why it's performing a certain way. This concept is called social listening and is essential in developing a brand that will last.



Find Opportunities



Understanding social media usage and listening to your client base offers a wealth of growth opportunities. This isn't just in how your company isn't meeting expectations but also in how to meet needs in a new way.&nbsp;



How to Make the Most of Social Media Usage



If you want to benefit from social media usage, you have to employ the right tools. This includes developing an effective brand strategy.



The right strategy can set you apart from your competition all while building a community based around your brand. Without a strong strategy, you won't see strong results.&nbsp;



Build Your Brand and Client Base



Social media usage and social media marketing are the future of brand development. Start building your client base with the right tools to monitor customer trends and customer behavior.&nbsp;

# How Heatmaps Can Improve Your SEO Strategy

Every SEO strategy relies on search engines to attract customers. These search engines bring people to your website, but the rest is up to you.



Your web pages and content influence conversion rates. Businesses use A/B split tests to test their way to high-converting pages. Heatmaps help take the guesswork out of the process.



Heatmaps can guide your SEO strategy and increase your conversion rates. These resources enable business owners to see how visitors engage with their content.



We'll share some ways heatmaps can improve your digital marketing efforts and boost sales, so keep reading below.&nbsp;



What Are Heatmaps?



Heatmaps provide visual representations of how users engage with your site. These maps track the mouse movement from each visitor's computer.



Most people's eyes move as they hover&nbsp;their computer mice. Heatmaps use various colors to indicate the warm and cold parts of a web page.



Red regions indicate popularity. Blue regions on a web page received less attention from visitors.



How to Use Heatmaps for SEO



Heatmaps let business owners&nbsp;see where visitors click the most across each&nbsp;web page. Businesses prioritize some calls to action more than others. Those key prompts should generate the most clicks.



You can relocate&nbsp;your vital calls to action to the most&nbsp;populated parts of your web page.



These shifts will improve the backend of your SEO marketing. More visitors will follow the prompts to subscribe to your list or schedule an appointment.



Heatmaps Can Boost Your Google Ranking



Heatmaps help business owners optimize the user experience. We've already covered how these insights can increase sales. Combining heatmaps with Google Analytics can also increase your search rankings.



Google uses various SEO data points to rank web pages. One of those metrics is bounce rate. Bounce rate measures how many people leave your website after visiting a single web page.



Sticky websites have lower bounce rates, and Google sees this as a perk. They associate in-demand websites with brand authority. 



Google only wants to show the top web pages&nbsp;to&nbsp;their users. Google likes when people&nbsp;spend more time on your&nbsp;website and browse through multiple articles.&nbsp;



Increasing your bounce rate and visit time makes your website more favorable from Google's perspective. The algorithm will gradually increase your ranking and help you reach more people. Prior optimizations from the heatmap's guidance will help you turn more traffic into more sales.



Your SEO Strategy Will Benefit From Heatmaps



Heatmaps provide extra data points for your SEO strategy. They let you see how visitors interact with your website. Improving the user experience will help with rankings and sales.



Heatmaps are one part of an effective SEO strategy. Combining the right pieces can help your company outshine the competition.



Our free SEO audit can help your business get rank well on Google and other search engines. We'll provide insights to improve your SEO strategy.

# Should You Use Review Incentives?

Full Content:
Any good business owner knows that customer reviews can make a huge difference in the success of a company. It can be tricky convincing your clients to write a glowing review, especially since you're asking them to take time out of their day. There are plenty of ways to get people to review your services, one of them being review incentives.



If you are interested in learning more, our guide is here to help. We'll explore the benefits of review incentives and how they can improve your business. 



Ready to learn more? Let's go.



What Are Review Incentives?



Review incentives are as simple as they sound. Essentially, you're offering rewards in exchange for reviews.



The most important rule that you need to follow is that the incentive needs to be completely disclosed. This means adding a line of text or a small badge outlining the promotion.



You'll also need to provide the incentive regardless of whether the review is&nbsp;positive or negative.&nbsp;



Remember to research the review incentive policy of different review websites to ensure that you're not doing anything that leads to penalties. For example, it’s illegal in the US and other countries to offer incentives for Google reviews unless the reviewer states they received compensation for the review. 



What Are Some Review Incentive Options?



The most obvious option for a review incentive is a discount. Not only are companies already prepared to offer deals, but customers are accustomed to collecting and applying coupons.&nbsp;



You can either offer a cash discount or a percentage-based discount. Make sure you calculate the amount to ensure profit.&nbsp;



Another review incentive option is to add a bonus to their next order. By offering an add-on or small sample as an incentive for writing an online review, you'll be able to introduce customers to a new product and keep a positive brand image.



Benefits of Review Incentives



One of the biggest benefits of review incentives is that you're likely to get a&nbsp;positive review. This will help maintain or increase your current reputation and improve your business.&nbsp;



You'll also have a happy customer on your hands, especially since they love to get freebies for only a small chunk of their time.&nbsp;



Another benefit is that once you have enough positive feedback, more customers will feel inclined to write reviews. This may not be a guarantee, but it certainly does help to have enough people review your business.



The Downside



Obviously, straddling a legal fine line is dangerous enough. But using incentives introduces other negative consequences, such as future expectations. If you use a review incentive, you could create an unrealistic expectation with customers that’s difficult to shake. Review = reward. No reward = no review.



You also may attract the wrong type of customer - one who preys on businesses by using a negative review as a blackmail opportunity. Using review incentives can simply change some customers' perception of you. Think something along the lines of, "what do they have to hide?"



Transform Your Business for the Better



In order for a business to flourish, it needs to attract new customers and keep current customers loyal. One of the best ways to do both is through positive customer reviews. Businesses with few or poor reviews are sure to suffer, especially with how much&nbsp;power the internet holds.



The good news is that you have plenty of ways to convince your customers to leave a review. Hopefully, our guide helps you make a more informed decision about whether to use review incentives. 



Looking to take your online business presence to the next level? Be sure to check out our services and contact us today! We specialize in reputation management and generating online reviews the old-fashioned way - by simply asking!

Did you know Coca-Cola spends a whopping&nbsp;$4 billion each year&nbsp;for branding? As a result, its brand has an estimated value of $80 billion. It enjoys a market share of 44%, and not even its closest rival comes near. There’s no doubting the brand authority of Coca-Cola. That’s the level any company would hope to accomplish.



What is brand authority, and why is it important? Simply put, it’s the trust of the consumers. The higher it is, the more the audience sees the company as an expert in the industry.



How do you use&nbsp;it to your advantage? Keep reading to learn tips for building brand authority.



Create Authoritative Content



Publishing content for the sake of SEO is one thing. Writing for the audience is another.



You have to know your customers before establishing yourself as an authority. What questions do they have? How can you help their buying journey?



If you want to make authoritative content, you must speak to the audience. Identify the pain points, answer their questions, and make something that adds value to their experience. It can be informative, exciting, or even inspiring.



Share valuable information, and do it regularly. Your site should have consistent updates to keep your audience coming back for more.



Let Your In-House Experts Speak



It’s not easy to establish authority as a company. You might want to put a face on your words.



Apple is an example of a company building brand authority with a singular person – Steve Jobs. You wouldn’t question the command of both. Still, it might not work for smaller and newer companies.



People can relate more to an actual person rather than a company. As such, it can be more effective to brand your team as in-house experts.



Let them talk about their expertise, share their credentials, and let people know about their achievements. Over time, your audience can recognize them as experts in their field.



Conduct and Publish Research



One way to boost your brand authority strategy is to publish original information. Conduct relevant research and publish the data you find.&nbsp;



The data from your surveys, studies, and reports provide value to your readers. Your audience knows they can’t find this information elsewhere.



By doing this strategy, you become an authority in your industry. Marketers and brands&nbsp;cite other sources to back their arguments. The media can publish your work, too.&nbsp;



Take Advantage of Social Proof



It’s not enough for your audience to think you’re decent at what you do. These people must&nbsp;be aware of how other people feel the same way.



According to Robert Cialdini’s&nbsp;social proof theory, people perceive an action as correct if they see others doing it. If they’re unsure of what to do, they’ll look to others for guidance.&nbsp;



How do you take advantage of that theory? You display testimonials and reviews from your other clients. When others view you as an authority, more people are likely to follow.



Display Your Awards



Have you won an award? These would help you incorporate social proof in your marketing.



It’s easier to raise your brand authority when another authoritative organization has already recognized you. Make sure to display any seal, badge, official recognition, and awards you’ve earned on your website.



Each time you win an award, write a blog post or two.&nbsp;Upload it on social media, as well.



Be Active on Social Media



Brand authority not only depends on your expertise and importance. It also has to do with your presence.



Set up profiles on social media and keep them updated. Share professional insight, valuable information, and other happenings. When you maintain an active presence, your audience will perceive you to be more authoritative.



Social media is also one of the best ways to connect with your audience. The more you engage with them, the more they’ll trust you.



Of course, you have to specialize in the&nbsp;right platform for your key demographic. Instagram and Facebook are your top choices for reaching millennials. You’ll find Gen Z in TikTok&nbsp;while most Gen Xers are on Facebook.



Do you want an easier time promoting your brand on these platforms? Consider&nbsp;investing in influencer marketing. Get a proper brand ambassador to represent your brand.



Branch Out



Make your presence more known by branching out of your social media accounts and website. Contribute content to other authoritative sites and write guest posts.



You might want to guest for podcasts, as well. The key is to provide your expertise in other places where your audience is already looking.



Host Events



Another way to get your name out there is to host a conference or event. As long as the&nbsp;occasion is relevant and value-adding, it can be small.



Invite&nbsp;influencers and authoritative figures in the industry. This way, you establish your brand as a leader.&nbsp;



You can also sponsor popular events related to your industry. You get your name out there, and you don’t have to do much.&nbsp;



Associate with Authoritative Brands



Look up the authoritative brands in your industry. How can you associate yourself with them?



You can collaborate, become a guest, or do other activities. You can work together to solve the same problem or answer the same question. That way, you get exposure to their audience and vice versa.&nbsp;



How does this align with the importance of building brand authority? Well, their audience may trust you, too, after you collaborate with the brand they already trust.



Learn More About Building Brand Authority



Building brand authority doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a painstakingly slow process&nbsp;requiring several strategies and follow-ups to get right. If you succeed, the result is&nbsp;to become a leading expert in your industry.



There’s no end to learning how to build brand authority.&nbsp;Contact us today&nbsp;to see how we can help.&nbsp;

Almost four billion people use the internet on a regular basis. That's almost half the world's total population, and the rate of use is even higher in many developed nations. Digital advertising for businesses is more popular than ever for good reason.



We live in a digital age. Businesses advertising online is not just the norm but instead has become an essential marketing practice. That's why we want to discuss some social media advertising trends that business owners ought to pay attention to.



Facebook and Instagram Are King



When it comes to marketing yourself on social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram tend to be the best places to start. Of the two platforms, Facebook reigns supreme for most demographics but there is an interesting caveat.



A&nbsp;recent survey&nbsp;from the Pew Research Center showed that Instagram is gaining on Facebook among the&nbsp;18-29 demographic. As it stands, the poll showed Instagram at just a one percent lead but that's likely to increase over time.



No matter your target audience, a strong presence on both platforms is almost sure to offer great ROI. If you can make engaging content,&nbsp;you don't need to pay to get it in front of people.&nbsp;They'll seek it out.



Social media marketing often sees this amazing potential for momentum to build up too. As you gain followers and learn more about the content they like most, they&nbsp;will share your material more and more.



Every shared post is a follower, for free, advertising to their friends and family. It takes some know-how to begin making that kind of content, but it is more than worth it.&nbsp;



Businesses Are Hiring Experts



It is not us simply being self-serving when we say more businesses are hiring experts as part of their&nbsp;social media advertising strategy. As online spaces grow more competitive, this trend is almost certain to continue.



We won't deny that it's possible for entrepreneurs to advertise themselves online. With the right expertise and time investment, you can certainly find your own growth. However, time spent&nbsp;marketing is time lost elsewhere.



Meanwhile, if you lack digital marketing expertise, it can be difficult to pull attention away from those companies who are using professional marketers. Your target demographic can only pay attention to so many companies at once, with more trying to attract their attention every day.



Teams like ours&nbsp;can help your business stay competitive. Moreover, expert marketing can pay for itself. If you spend a small amount of money and gain a significant number of new customers, you've made your investment back. In fact, that is the very point of professional marketing.



Understand Social Media Advertising Trends and More



The social media advertising trends we discussed here only represent the beginning of what a business can do online. If you'd like, we can help show you what online spaces can really offer.

# Online Payment Methods for Your Online Business

In a world where more transactions are being completed online, you need to provide options for your customers.



Accepting multiple payment options helps online business owners reach more customers. When these customers are scouring the internet for products and services, you are making their life easier by expanding their payment options.



With immediate payment and digital receipts, they can rest assured knowing that the process is complete. Most&nbsp;of these credit options can be directly implemented into the&nbsp;design of your website.&nbsp;



Continue reading to learn about the different online payment methods available to you.



Credit and Debit Card Processing



One of the most common payment types for online businesses is through the use of credit cards and debit cards. By accepting major credit card companies, your customers can enter their card information and be on their way.



Unfortunately, these methods of online payment require:



Applying and getting approved for merchant account useHigher fees for using cards



They might&nbsp;cost between 1.5% and 3.5%&nbsp;on every single transaction that a customer might make. That sounds small, but if everyone is using their debit and credit cards, that amount can add up quickly.&nbsp;



Payment Gateways



As technology advances,&nbsp;online payment gateways like&nbsp;Paypal are becoming more popular. In fact, most people already have an account of some type including:



Amazon PayApple PayGoogle Pay



With these online payment methods, your customers can pay for products and services without ever leaving your website.&nbsp;



Smartphone users likely already have these accounts, making the process quick and simple. Since most of their account information is already stored in their phone, it takes only a few simple taps of their finger to complete a transaction. Services like Amazon Pay allow customers to pay online on third-party websites without leaving the webpage.



While Paypal has rules and fees that vary depending on the type of currency and the amount of money for the transaction, GooglePay and Apple Pay are generally free to use for both the customer and the merchant. These applications make for a seamless shopping experience for everyone involved.



Electronic Checks via ACH



For individuals who either don't have a debit card they are comfortable using online or don't have access to an online payment option, you could offer eChecks as an online payment method. This is possible because the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network can process electronic checks automatically and securely.



This method isn't as feasible, however, because most people have other options at their disposal.&nbsp;



Cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin!)



Bitcoin is a self-regulated currency that is only available online. With cryptocurrency, there is a low risk of compromised information. Unfortunately, the value of bitcoins fluctuates - just as any type of currency does.



If your clients live in a different country, normal payment methods can be difficult to access. As online transactions become more mainstream, it could be a good idea to offer this type of payment processing.



Online Payment Methods



By offering several different online payment methods, you are setting your online business up for success. It's all about having happy, satisfied customers. After setting up several different payment methods, you will find that you are bringing in more sales.

# Native vs Display Advertising: Comparing Types of Programmatic Advertising

Step one for anyone looking to advertise their business is to review studies on the best advertising methods. Since 74% of people&nbsp;claim to be tired of ads, it's important to strike the right balance!



There are the two main types of programmatic digital advertising: native and display.&nbsp; The question is, what's the difference? Read on to find out about native vs display advertising.



Display Advertising



Display ads are one of the methods of&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;you may have noticed most.



Think of the banner ads that often used to pop up on websites (though this happening less and less). They would advertise a product or service that may have something to do with the page you're on. And they would be extremely hard to miss.



That is a display ad.



They could also be in the form of videos or pop-up ads.



With&nbsp;five clicks per ten thousand&nbsp;impressions, they don't tend to drive as much traffic as companies are hoping for, on average. They are great for brand recognition and awareness though, and should be part of your strategy.&nbsp;



Native Advertising



Native is the softer choice when it comes to programmatic ads. They usually match the content and tone of the page they're posted on, so there isn't as a jarring change. Often, they appear to be informational in nature instead of an advertisement - this works a lot more subtly to persuade the target customer. A word of caution: it's important to provide value with the landing page of a native ad. Don't pull a bait-and-switch just to drive traffic. 



Backlinks in webpages that take you to another service are counted as native ads, as well as social media sponsored posts on influencers' pages.



Which Is the Best Form of Programmatic Digital Advertising?



27% of American internet users&nbsp;block ads when browsing online. Although ad blockers are a little harder to use on mobile, display ads often aren't mobile-friendly.



Ad blockers can't pick up on native ads as well. The clickthrough rate for display ads also tends to be very low, whereas native ads, in general, have a higher chance of persuading a consumer to do something.



Ultimately, whether you choose to employ native ads or display ads as your programmatic advertisements is up to you, but there are clear advantages to one of them.&nbsp;



Display ads mean that the person can't miss what's being advertised, though they're less likely to click unless they truly need the service or product.



Native ads work in a much subtler way, but they aren't as in the user's faces which makes them less likely to take an instant dislike to the ad.



Display ads, however, may work better if the product or service is highly related to the page the user is on, making it highly desirable for them.



Advertising Is Complex



The important thing to remember is that there's a lot that goes into advertising. There are a lot of factors that go into a clickthrough rate and whether someone ends up actually making a purchase, and it's essential to consider all of them.



However, the type of ad used is a definite factor and you should bear it in mind.

# The Digital Marketing Trends for 2022

It's no secret that digital marketing is an ever-evolving beast. It's become the main way companies communicate with consumers, and the main way people find businesses. Gone are the days of flyers and word of mouth being the prime marketing tactics!



With digital marketing changing from year to year, it's important to be ahead of the curve and know what's coming up.



As we approach the end of 2021, here are the digital marketing trends 2022 will bring. Be aware of them and ready to adapt. 



Artificial Intelligence Rising



While A.I. has already become one of the top digital marketing trends and is already used for numerous tasks (such as suggesting keywords and reporting on traffic), it's safe to assume that its rise will continue through 2022 and even the years beyond.



Despite it already finding its place, A.I. is a new technology that has so far to go. Companies are likely to use it to suggest things to customers based on their buying and browsing history. And there's no doubt it will find even more use in the future.



It has so many advantages that it's impossible to ignore the potential there is to explore.&nbsp;



Remote Working vs. In-Person



Although remote work used to be unusual, 2020 saw that change when a pandemic swept over the globe. Working from home became the only safe option — and, to everyone's surprise,&nbsp;productivity actually increased&nbsp;despite the ever-looming stress of COVID-19.&nbsp;



Although it's becoming safer to meet again in person, it's likely that remote working will never truly return to the uncommon situation it once was because it's been proven it works.



What's more likely is a hybrid between the two, with a lot of digital marketing now being done from home.&nbsp;



More Influencer Work



People often speculate that the influencer market is dying, but it's actually not the case. In fact, it's projected to grow from $9.7 billion in 2021 to&nbsp;$15 billion in 2022, which is a huge leap.&nbsp;



That means influencers are likely still going to be one of the key marketing trends that just keeps going up. If you thought 2022 digital trends would see the death of influencers, think again!



Although some influencers' audiences come and go and have had their time in the spotlight, there are many that are still gaining followers at a drastic late and this makes them a valuable marketing asset.&nbsp;



Chatbots



Chatbots have already become integral to many websites. They have the ability to answer basic questions based on what the customer types, to recognize words and find a scripted answer they can send back immediately.



This saves a lot of time for employees who would otherwise have to answer those questions.&nbsp;



However, in 2022, chatbots are going to become even more advanced. Companies aim to find ways that the chatbot can become even more responsive to customers and recommend things for them to buy or answer questions about the product or service they're looking at. 



Chatbots are invaluable. With a large customer base it's impossible to give every single person the attention they deserve. Chatbots can answer thousands of people at once.&nbsp;



More Mobile-Friendly Designs and Codes



These days, most traffic coming through the internet is mobile. In fact, out of 4.48 billion internet users,&nbsp;4 billion of them&nbsp;use their phones.&nbsp;



That means one of the 2022 digital marketing trends will be to focus on a mobile-friendly experience. Although most companies do this to an extent, there are still plenty of sites out there that don't have&nbsp;responsive designs&nbsp;or apps.



Companies will have to make sure their website works well on mobile devices to keep up, or create an intuitive user-friendly app.&nbsp;



Working With Non-Profits



People are becoming increasingly endeared to companies that have causes they actually care about. Education on important issues is widespread these days. People are passionate about various passionate causes — whether it's human rights, animal rights, the environment, or something else entirely.



Working with non-profits is already starting to trend upwards, and is ready to move even further in 2022.&nbsp;



It will be important, however, for companies to find non-profits that genuinely align with their mission and passion. Otherwise, they risk seeming performative, which could end up being a very bad thing for their business.&nbsp;



Alternatives to Third Party Cookies



Perhaps the biggest of the 2022 marketing trends is that&nbsp;Google will no longer support&nbsp;third-party cookies — or anything that tracks in a similar way. This is huge, as online advertisers rely on these.



Budgets will be redirected to focus on reaching audiences through keywords and organic searches more than relying on what they may have searched in the past. Ultimately though, we're still learning about the alternatives and how exactly they'll shape digital marketing in the future. There's no doubt that the result will be huge.&nbsp;



With These Digital Marketing Trends, 2022 Will Look Like This



Although things are ever-changing and it's impossible to make exact predictions with any great certainty, we can assume that with these digital marketing trends, 2022 is shaping up to look something like this: improved artificial intelligence, no more third-party cookies, a surge of hybrid working, and collaborations with non-profits and influencers.



Being aware of these things can help you get ahead of the game with your company and prepare you for what's coming.

With&nbsp;nearly nine out of ten&nbsp;consumers reading reviews before ever making a purchase online, it can feel as if a bad online reputation is the death of the company.



Often, it's something small that spirals out of control — an order gone wrong, or a poor choice of words from a social media agent.



If this has happened to your business and people are disparaging your company online, it's time for some online reputation repair. Yes, it's doable!



Set Up Google Alerts



When it comes to repairing your online reputation, the first thing you should make sure of is that you're in control of the conversation. As stressful as it can be to read the comments, you need to make sure you're aware of what people are saying.



Aside from keeping up with social media, you can do this by setting up&nbsp;Google Alerts. Google will send you an email when it detects new results based on the term you've set up an alert for (in this case, likely your business name).



You might feel that you don't want to see what's being said, but you need to be in the know.&nbsp;



Respond to Complaints



To repair your online reputation, you'll have to respond to complaints.



If it's something tiny that will blow over, you should ignore it — but if you already have a bad reputation from this issue, chances are, it's not small. It's already escalated into something larger.



When customers complain on social media or on your website, answer them. Be as empathetic as possible, and make them feel seen and heard.&nbsp;



Don't automate the responses if possible, as customers can sense this a mile off and see it as insincere.&nbsp;



Be Transparent With the Solution



The best online reputation repair solutions are not only empathetic, but they're transparent.



When responding to people, let them know how you intend to do better moving forward. Not only that, but you might want to make a social media statement about it.



It might seem like drawing unnecessary attention to the issue. But if everyone already knows and it's damaging business, it's the best way to go.&nbsp;



Display Testimonials and Positive Reviews



As you move forward, display testimonials on your website. Contact valued customers and&nbsp;ask for some great reviews&nbsp;to showcase on your website or ask them to post on Google. With time, the good can outweigh the bad, and you'll appear more authentic than a business with a perfect 5.0 rating.



Show people that you've done some stellar work! At Pixaura, we help our clients generate and display testimonials from their customers - we can help you too.



Start Fixing Your Reputation Today



Online reputation repair might seem impossible, especially if the word has spread and sales are dipping. However, it's possible even when things have gone so far that you feel helpless.



The important thing is to stay in control of the conversation and be involved in it. Talk to the unhappy customers, offer solutions, and work hard to repair your reputation. It will pay off in the long run.



Do you need help with online review generation or another service to improve your reputation?&nbsp;Contact us today&nbsp;for a free consultation at Pixaura Digital and see how we can help.

# Google Guarantee Certification: Why You Need It

Everyone knows that these days, Google is pretty much vital to becoming a successful business.



88% of people&nbsp;who searched for a local business on Google visited a related place within a week. It's how people find out where to go and what services to use.&nbsp;



It can be hard to be visible on Google with so much competition. But one way to ensure your business is both seen and respected is with a Google Guarantee Certification.



Never heard of it? Here's what it is, and why you need it.&nbsp;



What Is Google Guaranteed?



The Google Guarantee certification or badge is a verified checkmark that essentially says Google believes in your business. It's designed to provide support for local businesses and ensure that people aren't tricked into enlisting the services of a fraud.



If a customer sees a business has earned Google Guarantee verification, they know Google trusts them — so they can too.



How Do You Become Certified?



To become Google Guaranteed, you need to pass a variety of screening and certification measures. These include looking into the business's license, checking out their liability insurance, and running background checks.



What specifics are necessary tends to vary by industry, but Google will want to make sure you are completely legitimate.



This is because they actually cover the cost of the&nbsp;customer's dissatisfaction&nbsp;if that happens!



If a customer isn't happy with a Google Guaranteed business, they can contact Google and ask for reimbursement. The good news is that Google will always reach out to the business first to see what happened before assuming the business is in the wrong.



Does It Cost Money?



Google Guarantee costs&nbsp;$50 per month.&nbsp;



The many advantages of Google Guarantee make this worth it for most businesses. When a potential customer searches for local businesses on Google, they're likely going to see a whole host of options.



The quickest way to start filtering them out is to look at the ones who have undergone rigorous background checks by Google and are far less likely to be scamming people.



How Do I Become Google Guaranteed?



To become Google Guaranteed, you should sign up for Local Services ads. These are currently the only businesses that are eligible to receive that stamp of approval.&nbsp;



This alone can help your business, as it'll boost you to the top of Google search results. Once you've registered, you can look into getting certified.&nbsp;



Google Guarantee Is Worth It



If you're looking to grow your business, it might seem like Google Guarantee is just another unnecessary expense to account for every month. The truth is, however, that Google Guarantee can help your business in many ways.



Google is a highly reputable company that consumers trust, and having their stamp of approval on your services is invaluable.



Do you need help getting "Guaranteed?" At Pixaura Digital Marketing, we can help you with Local Service Ads and taking the steps to become Google Guarantee certified.&nbsp;Contact us today&nbsp;for a free consultation!&nbsp;

# How to Reduce Abandoned Carts & Improve Checkout Process

Full Content:
It's easy to underestimate the value of the checkout process. One might think that once a would-be customer has selected what they want and put it in their cart, you may as well have made the sale. However, that isn't the case.



Cart abandonment, where someone simply leaves your website without confirming their purchases, is a real issue for many online stores.



Join us today as we discuss some ways to get customers to stick with their shopping carts all the way through to the sale. We'll discuss some of the reasons customers abandon carts as well as actionable methods to convince them to buy.



What Causes Cart Abandonment?



Online shopping can be complex psychologically. If someone is putting items into their online shopping cart and abandoning them, you often have a sale in waiting. The trick is determining why that person abandoned their cart.



We'll begin by reviewing some of these common causes and then discuss solutions shortly after.



Error or Forgetfulness



While cart abandonment is never desirable, it's generally the hope of business owners that the only thing causing it is error or forgetfulness on the part of the customer.&nbsp;



It may sound like wishful thinking, but many abandoned carts really result from a simple mistake. This won't&nbsp;always&nbsp;be the case, but it's a more common occurrence among frequent online shoppers than we might expect.



Customers might select what they want and then wait, perhaps for a paycheck or confirm what people in the household want. If enough time passes, it's easy to forget about that cart even if you wanted everything in it.



Intrusive Design



When customers visit your online store, they want to make a purchase.&nbsp;Certain design choices, like&nbsp;forcing&nbsp;them to make an account, come off as annoying and intrusive.&nbsp;



As a rule, the path that allows a stranger to your store to visit your site, select what they want, and make their purchase should be simple. The fewer hoops they have to go through, the less likely they are to bounce off.



The mistake many entrepreneurs make is getting too excited at the idea of a new prospect.&nbsp;If you push too hard for someone to make an account or give personal information, sometimes you'll only end up burning a sale.



Bad Price Updating



The psychological line that decides whether someone views a store as honest or not is often blurry. However, one of the quickest ways to put a customer off is making them think you're trying to obscure the price they'll be paying.



Many online shopping sites make the big mistake of only estimating the total of a purchase near the end of the process. The trouble with this is that if taxes and shipping suddenly add 20+ dollars to the cost right before they confirm, it feels like you're trying to cheat them.



It can be a good idea to try and estimate the shipping and tax of a customer's selection as early as possible. You can also keep a small running total somewhere on the page, so they always know the rough value of what's in their cart.



Improving Your Shopping and Checkout Processes



There is good news: abandoned carts means site visitors who reach that point tend to be near the final steps of the&nbsp;sales funnel. They know about your site, want what you have, and only then did something put them off.



There are a few ways to help correct your site and general processes to guide lost customers back. Here are some of the most actionable tips for shopping online services.



First, you need to&nbsp;make purchases easy. The more steps a customer has to take to make a purchase, the more customers you will lose. Customers with accounts should make a purchase with only a couple of clicks if they so desire.



Second, be honest and straightforward in your design. Show a rough estimate of how much a customer's cart will cost as soon as possible and make removing items they don't want simple. You'd rather have a smaller sale than no sale.



Third, remind customers who have accounts with you about their carts. Send them emails on occasion mentioning they still have a full cart, especially if new deals are available.



Using Professional Help



Finally, consider the help of a&nbsp;web design service. Companies like ours have studied customer psychology and know a lot about what works when it comes to e-commerce.&nbsp;

When you're using SEO and&nbsp;paid advertisement&nbsp;to increase traffic and drive conversions, it's important to have a tool that can help you track your results or progress. But first, you need to know your business goals — what are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to increase sales or create more awareness for your brand? You need&nbsp;to track Google Analytics&nbsp;Metrics to help you measure your success.&nbsp;







Incoming Traffic



You need to track where the incoming traffic is coming from. The primary sources of your traffic include direct visitors, referral visitors and search visitors.&nbsp;Direct visitors are those that type your URL into Google's address bar; referral visitors are those that visit your website because they saw it either on a blog or another website; search visitors are those that type certain keywords in Google.&nbsp;



As soon as you can determine where the traffic is coming from, calculate which incoming traffic gives you more conversions. You can then take action based on your data by improving your marketing strategies or maximizing traffic from a certain source.



Average Time Spent



This metric shows how much time, on average, a visitor spends on your website. Tracking this metric tells you how your website is performing. If the average time spent is lower, it means that your visitors are not enjoying what they see on the website. Your website may be slower, or the layout is not great. It could also mean that your visitors do not like the content you publish. You can analyze why your visitors don't stay on your website longer and then take action using the other metrics. If you're not highly adept with Google Analytics or SEO, get help from professionals.&nbsp;



Bounce Rates



The bounce rate is the percentage of visitors that visit only one page on your website and then leaves. When your bounce rate is higher, it could mean that you have poor landing pages or the user encountered a technical problem. Investigate why your bounce rate is high by checking your landing pages, making sure it's working, and checking if there are no broken backlinks that may contribute to the problem. If you need assistance, you can always contact&nbsp;Google Analytics experts, who can give you more data on why the bounce rate is high and what you can do to correct it.&nbsp;



Organic Vs. Paid Traffic



Organic traffic are those coming from search engines that are not paid. Paid traffic are traffic from paid advertisements. Tracking this metric tells you which of the two is more effective. If you get more organic traffic, consider maximizing your SEO efforts to drive more traffic and conversions. If you get low traffic from our paid ads, check whether the ads are attractive and effective. You may consider tweaking them and tracking the progress afterward.



Top Performing Landing Pages



This metric tells you which pages get the most traffic. Check all these pages and analyze why they performed well. Evaluate the content, layout, call to action you used, and the overall user experience. As soon as you have the data on why these pages are performing, apply it to the other pages that are not getting any traffic. For your top-performing pages, consider boosting them to generate more traffic and increase conversions.&nbsp;



Conversion Rate



If you're running a business, then Conversions should be the top metric you need to track as that shows whether or not your marketing efforts are paying off or reaching out to your target market. The conversion rate is the percentage of visitors that performed an action divided by the total number of interactions. If the social media ad was shown about 2000 times and about 100 people converted from that ad, your conversion rate is about 5 percent.&nbsp;



Location



Location report gives you insights on where your visitors are coming from. Tracking this metric gives you opportunities to enhance your marketing strategy for that certain location or improving your content that would appeal to that certain geographic location. If you use social media, consider advertising to this location to generate more conversions.&nbsp;



In-Page Analytics



This metric gives you information on the percentage of clicks on each of the internal links on your website. It can help you identify where the visitors click on your site and what areas are the most popular with the visitors. If there's an important link that you would like your visitors to see, such as a sales page, then make sure that you place it in areas of your site that gets the most click.



Worst Performing Pages



Apart from tracking your top-performing pages, you need to also find out what pages are not performing well. Analyze why the pages are not getting any traffic and improve them. You may consider updating the content or adding more relevant information and high-quality photos. You can check your top-performing pages to help you improve the low-performing ones. If you need help, don't hesitate to get in touch with the experts.&nbsp;

Over 40% of the Internet&nbsp;is built off of WordPress. And that's not a coincidence.



WordPress offers a world full of everything at your fingertips: SEO, plugins, responsive design, coding done for you, and easy ways to post articles.



Yet it can be quite overwhelming if you're new to using WordPress. If that's the case, here are a few WordPress tips for beginners to help you ease into the platform and get started right away!



Invest in the Right Theme



When using WordPress, the only thing that actually makes your website have a unique "look" is&nbsp;the theme&nbsp;that you choose. Depending on your niche, you'll want to display different things on your website.



For instance, if you're a travel blogger, you may want a theme that has a widget to show your current location, a sliding bar showing your Instagram photos, and a photography-heavy blog post showcase.



If your website has to do with coding, you wouldn't need much about photography at all. Your theme may be more technical or word-based. Be sure to pick a theme that has responsive design - this is a fancy way of saying your site will look great on any device.



Choose the Right Plugins



A plugin is a component of software that brings you a user-friendly feature without having to code or do your own building.



When starting out, you want plugins for WordPress security. This will help you keep your website secure from any hackers. You'll also want a plugin for&nbsp;SEO, which will help you determine if you will be getting views from search engines once you go live.



When looking for the best plugins, pay attention to how many active users there are as well as the rating for each plugin.



Optimize Your Site Speed



Internet users simply do not have much patience. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, it's almost guaranteed they'll leave your site.



Ways to increase your website's load time include:




Compressing images



Using a lightweight, responsive theme



Utilize browser caching



Reducing redirects



Limiting plugins



Choose a fast hosting server




Connect Contact Forms to Your Email Marketing



Chances are that if you have your own WordPress website, you are probably also using an email marketing platform. If that's the case, you will want your contact forms to connect to your email. You will also want to add sign-up forms around your website for people to sign-up to receive emails or marketing from you.



Get Help From a Professional



Although there are free resources on the Internet, these are not always comprehensive enough to get you where you need to be. If you need help or want to get a head start,&nbsp;using a team&nbsp;that knows all there is to know about website design will help you more than you can imagine.



From design tips, SEO strategies, advertising, social media management, and so much more, they have an entire array of knowledge that you may not have about using WordPress or designing a responsive website.



Use These WordPress Tips for Beginners



It's not easy starting off using WordPress for the first time. Although it's pretty user-friendly, there are so many WordPress hacks that you may not know right from the get-go.



Follow these WordPress tips for beginners to get started. Once you feel like you're in a good place, you can start to&nbsp;expand your brand strategy&nbsp;to build your website even further.



WordPress offers an almost endless amount of opportunities to improve not only your website but your business operations. From cornerstone content to e-commerce to analytics, the advanced features available on WordPress can raise your game. Need a hand? Drop us a line.

# Cornerstone Content for SEO

In masonry, the cornerstone is the first stone in the construction of the foundation. Likewise, your website's cornerstone&nbsp;content&nbsp;plays a significant role in SEO strategy and you need to place the content appropriately.  



If you write many articles, posts, and&nbsp;content&nbsp;about a topic/subject like "SEO" you need to define one page/URL as the&nbsp;cornerstone&nbsp;content. For example, inside of Pixaura.com this SEO page becomes the&nbsp;cornerstone&nbsp;page for SEO - AND we tell Google this. Without a&nbsp;cornerstone&nbsp;page, everything you post about SEO will compete against each other to attract Google's attention.&nbsp;Using the cornerstone method we build up the SEO rank power for this particular page by adding new supporting&nbsp;content, posts, FAQs, etc... within your site.&nbsp;After we fix the majority of SEO architecture on your site we begin a&nbsp;content&nbsp;strategy to build all of the&nbsp;content&nbsp;around your site to support these&nbsp;cornerstones.&nbsp;



How Many SEO Cornerstones?



Your entire site cannot be Cornerstones. You need to pick the most important product or service and within your business, create these cornerstone pages, then develop supporting content around these ideas.



Keyword Selection



Pixaura will help you select the SEO keywords and phrases. Some data we use to make these decisions include Keyword Difficulty and Search Volume. Additionally, we consider the PPC environment... what is the average cost per click for an ad, and how many competitors are advertising?  Your Google ads strategy and your SEO strategy can, and should, complement each other. 



SEO Landing Page



Now that you've established your cornerstone content, the page needs to convert visitors into clients. This is where Pixaura helps with CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization). How do we design the page so that it converts the visitors into clients? Pixaura handles this by implementing excellent web design UI/UX and content and analyzes everything we build with data. We use heat maps and track user journeys to identify where visitors spend time, what they like, and where they drop off.



Link Counter



How many internal pages link to the cornerstone page? Your cornerstones should definitely have the most internal links. We recommend installing the Yoast SEO plugin and checking your internal link count.

# How Does Site Speed Affect SEO?

Did you know that as a&nbsp;page's load time&nbsp;increases from one to three seconds, the probability of people leaving your website moves to 32%? This is a lot of lost traffic. But did you know that can impact your SEO?&nbsp;



To attract organic visitors, you need a fast website. Read on as we discuss the effect of site speed on SEO.&nbsp;



Site Speed Importance



Site speed&nbsp;impacts your SEO&nbsp;in a number of ways. These can be broken down into two distinct areas.&nbsp;



Google and other search engines actively use your site loading speed to&nbsp;evaluate your SEO score. This is because a slow-loading site is one that generally is not as usable as one that loads quickly.&nbsp;



A secondary effect of slow site load speed is that people leave your site quickly. If it takes time to load, people will not wait, but go elsewhere. This impacts a metric called your bounce rate, also part of search engine algorithms used to see if your content is&nbsp;providing value to visitors.&nbsp;



What Is a Good Site Load Speed?



It is recommended by Google and other search engines that websites should perform a site speed test that comes in at under two seconds. There are a number of websites and tools where you can check site speed, one of the most used being Google's own&nbsp;page speed insights.&nbsp;Run a few tests to determine your average score. Your site speed can vary based on time of day, current site visitors and other factors.



Want to test multiple pages with minimum effort? Check out this nifty bulk page speed test tool. You can test your desktop or mobile speeds, a selected group of URL's, or every page in your site at once.



Pixaura.com - Page Speed Insight



Mobile Devices



A good site speed on a desktop alone is also not enough. More internet searches originate on mobile devices these days. Therefore, it is important that your website optimizes its mobile site speed as well as desktop.



Not only does the speed matter, but the site itself should be responsive. This means it will adapt to fit any screen, changing image sizes and text.&nbsp;



Improving Speed



It can be extremely tough - and frustrating - to improve your page speed. One element may improve but you find another has slowed down. Try tweaking the following to see if you can make an improvement:



Clean up Code



Excess code makes your site much heavier and slower. You can improve site speed by deleting unnecessary or unwanted plugins, themes, and applications. After this, hire a professional coder to minify code on your website.



Images



Large images can really slow your page load speed. Make sure you have a maximum pixel size for feature images and a smaller size for internal images. Install an image compressor to make the file sizes smaller.&nbsp;



Check Your Hosting



Your host is the server that stores all of your website code and files. Beware - not all hosting or packages are created equal. Speak with the providers and see if they can upgrade you to dedicated servers - or look at moving your website elsewhere.&nbsp;Pixaura utilizes dedicated Siteground cloud hosting for all of our clients. For custom web-based apps, we use AWS hosting for our clients. 



CDN - Content Delivery Network



CDN is a content delivery network or content distribution network. A CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users.



Staying Fast



Site speed needs regular checkups. It is not something you can leave and forget about. As the web changes and your site adds pages, features and functions, you need regularly updates.&nbsp;



If you need assistance improving your speed, Pixaura should be your first stop. We specialize in SEO services, but we also have a range of digital services, from web design to advertising.&nbsp;Contact us&nbsp;to discuss your needs and let us help you thrive in the digital economy.&nbsp;

If you haven't created dedicated landing pages for your marketing campaigns, now is the perfect time to start. Because&nbsp;according to Hubspot, companies who use 10-15 landing pages across their promotions get 55% more leads!&nbsp;



Landing pages might be a highly effective way to grow your business, but if you are going to use them, you need to know how to get the best landing page conversions.



In this guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know about creating landing pages that drive more conversions for your business.&nbsp;



What Is a Landing Page and Why Use One?



If you are getting decent traffic numbers to your website and sales are going up, you might wonder whether there's any point in using a landing page.



However, a landing page is critical if you plan on running any marketing or&nbsp;paid promotional campaigns.&nbsp;It is a purposeful one-page form with a strong call to action to capture email addresses or other contact information from customers.



You need to put a landing page in front of prospective customers if you are running any online marketing. You want your target customer to take action, and a landing page is your tool for doing that.&nbsp;



The Benefits of Creating Landing Pages for Each Marketing Campaign



The first job of a good landing page is to collect email addresses and grow your email list. That's why the most high-converting landing pages tend to be light on features and focus heavily on a single form field for the email address.&nbsp;



Get your landing page strategy right for each campaign, and you can potentially grow your email list by hundreds or even thousands of subscribers in a matter of months.



Consider the rate of this growth in the context of your business, particularly if you can translate a small percentage of those subscribers into paying customers.&nbsp;



In short, a great landing page for every single marketing promotion is central to your&nbsp;digital marketing strategy. It can have a direct link to your revenue growth.&nbsp;



If you create dedicated landing pages for each new marketing campaign, you can achieve a more personalized sales funnel. And with a landing page builder, it costs minimum time and effort to create one.



Each campaign sales funnel will ultimately help you maximize conversions. You can align your marketing messages with your offers.



How to Boost Landing Page Conversions



Of course, even when you understand the power of a landing page, getting the right page for each campaign is a different matter. However, you can follow plenty of best practice tips to ensure you are achieving a high conversion rate.&nbsp;



Choose The Right Offer



Every landing page design should have something enticing to offer the audience. This offer must have a tangible link to your business services or products and be something that your target audience will love.



It must be relevant. It might be tempting to run an iPad competition. But you will get email addresses from people who want an iPad, not the product you sell (unless you sell iPads, of course).&nbsp;



Pick a Great Headline



The most critical aspect of each landing page is your headline. According to&nbsp;Marketing Sherpa, you can double your conversion rate simply by improving your headline.



Good headlines encourage a visitor to continue reading your landing page instead of clicking on the back button.



It is the first thing someone will read when they hit your landing page. So you must take time to create copy that will capture their attention.&nbsp;



Aim for 7-10 words, use power and action words, and make the headline relatable to your target audience.&nbsp;



Keep It Simple



It's tempting to try something clever and innovative when creating a marketing campaign, but when it comes to landing pages, keep it simple, like these&nbsp;landing page examples.&nbsp;



Use precise language that your audience will recognize, simple graphics that don't distract from the message, and easy-to-understand call-to-actions.



Don't overwhelm your audience with a big, complex form. Stick to a simple field for the visitor to enter their email address, a check box covering the terms, and a clearly labeled submit button.&nbsp;



Strong Branding



Suppose a visitor discovers your campaign landing page after learning about your business from your website or social media, or even a paid ad. In that case, you want to provide some reassurance that they are in the right place.&nbsp;



That's where effective branding comes in. Use fonts, colors, and your branding guidelines to ensure your landing page design is consistent with the rest of your business.&nbsp;



Not only does this remind visitors where they are, but it is an extra selling point to boost conversions. They will see branding from a business they already know, like, and trust.&nbsp;



Split Test



Test, don't guess. That's the rule to follow when trying to improve conversion rates. If you have a landing page with low conversion, you might feel tempted to look at that page and take an educated guess as to where the problem lies.&nbsp;



But you'd be surprised at how easy this guesswork is to get wrong. In reality, the only way you can figure out a conversion problem is to run some split tests.



That means testing two nearly-identical landing pages, sending half of your traffic to each page.&nbsp;



Start by testing two different headlines, then your sub-headline, followed by your call to action. If that doesn't work, test your images and, finally, your offer.&nbsp;



Consider Video



As the old saying goes: show, don't tell. When it comes to landing pages, the best way to put this rule into practice is to use video. It will demonstrate the beauty of what you have to offer your audience in each campaign.&nbsp;



Use a short 20-30 second video to show your audience what they will get when entering their email address. If your offer is something small like a discount voucher, you might think this is too much.



But you can be smart with this and use your video to feature a customer testimonial. A happy customer talking to the camera about&nbsp;snapping up your fantastic product using a discount voucher can have a positive impact!&nbsp;



Creating Landing Pages to Grow Your Business



It's time to start building landing pages for your next marketing campaign. Creating landing pages that convert well can significantly impact the number of leads you get and your revenue, so it's a wise investment.

Nearly 70% of&nbsp;all activity online&nbsp;starts with a search engine like Bing or Google. With search engine optimization (SEO), you can appear in front of relevant searches. Unfortunately, most people (75%) never look beyond the first page of results.



You need both on-page SEO&nbsp;and&nbsp;off-page SEO to improve your rankings.



What's the difference between on-page SEO vs off-page SEO? Keep reading to find out. After reading this guide, you can start building your SEO marketing strategy.



Boost your rankings to start reaching more customers with these tips today!



What is On-Page SEO?



First, let's answer the question that likely brought you here: what is on-page SEO, exactly?



On-page SEO refers to tactics completed on&nbsp;your&nbsp;website that can benefit your search engine rankings. On-page tactics can involve the words you use on a webpage or your site's design and development.



You have complete control over your on-page SEO factors. On-page search engine optimization will show Google and readers your content is relevant. You can also demonstrate the quality of your content, which can boost your credibility.



There are a few different on-page SEO factors you'll need to consider to improve your ranking.



URL Structure



First, consider the URL you create for each new page on your website. It's important to consider how one URL will impact&nbsp;the URL structure of future pages.



For example, some websites set up their blogs as a subdomain (blog.yourdomain.com) versus a subfolder (yourdomain.com/blog).



Using a subfolder can benefit your main website's domain authority. Otherwise, the backlinks you generate for a subdomain won't benefit your main site.



You might find it difficult to improve your ranking for the main site&nbsp;and&nbsp;a subdomain if you decide to use both.



When creating subfolders, it's important to keep the number of folders you create to a minimum. You can create a flat site structure. This structure is easier for search engines to crawl.



Some content management systems like WordPress will automatically set your URL as the post title. Try to shorten your URL when needed, though. Shorter URLs look better on search engine result pages (SERP).



It can also help readers better understand your content.



Meta Descriptions



Consumers often skim-read meta descriptions when exploring the results of SERP. Your meta description can entice consumers to click on your website. If your meta description doesn't appeal to their interests, you'll fail to generate website traffic.



When creating your meta description, make sure it's engaging, informative, and easy to read. Keep it short (you only have 160 characters). Don't forget to include your target keyword within the meta description, too.



Search engine crawlers also look at your meta description to learn more about your content. Creating strong meta descriptions will make it easier for search engines to crawl and index your content.



Title Tags



Title tags tell search engines what title to display on SERP. They're an HTML element.



Make sure your title tag is relevant to the content and contains your target keyword. Choose titles that are unique to the rest of your content, too.



Try to create engaging titles that encourage people to click on your content.



Content Structure



Most people think of content structure when discussing on-page SEO.



How you structure your content can help search engines crawl and index your website. It's important to write for consumers, not search engines, though.



Use headings and subheadings to organize your content. Make sure your target keyword appears in an H1 tag. Crawlers assign top priority to H1 tags.



Image Alt Text



Use high-quality images for your pages and blog posts. Then, add the target keyword to the image filename. Include the keyword in the image alt text, too.&nbsp;



Links



Links are also important on-page SEO factors. First, include internal links. Internal links send readers to other pages on your site.



Use external links to statistics and research to boost your credibility.



Site Speed and Mobile Optimization



Google&nbsp;uses&nbsp;mobile-first indexing&nbsp;when determining rankings.&nbsp;Make sure you're optimized for mobile devices.



Then, speed up your page load times.



When updating your website, make sure to appeal to&nbsp;Google's Core Web Vitals, too.&nbsp;



What is Off-Page SEO?



What is off-page SEO, then? Off-page SEO refers to factors that are beyond your website. You might not have complete control over these factors.



Good off-page SEO can boost your brand awareness and credibility.&nbsp;



Backlinks



When choosing which off-page SEO techniques to focus on, start by creating backlinks. Backlinks are links that send readers from&nbsp;other&nbsp;sites to&nbsp;your&nbsp;web content.&nbsp;



You can start guest blogging to generate backlinks. Find websites that already reach your target audience. Make sure the content on that website is high-quality.



Choose websites that have a high domain authority before guest blogging, too. Make sure the anchor text that holds your link is relevant to your content.&nbsp;



Google claims backlinks are one of its&nbsp;top three ranking factors. The more backlinks a page has, the more organic traffic it can generate.



Domain Strength



Domain strength measures your website's authority on a scale of 0 to 100. Factors that impact domain strength include:




User experience



Relevancy to the search query



Website traffic statistics



Your link profile




Many of the on- and off-page SEO techniques mentioned above can impact your score.



Social Sharing



Social media won't directly impact your SEO rankings. However, generating traffic to your website can boost your ranking. You can use social sharing to generate more website traffic.

Do you want to grow your platform on LinkedIn?



LinkedIn provides business owners with a great opportunity to engage with other people in a professional manner. This helps them build rapport with companies, individuals, and supporters. It can ultimately grow revenue and expand business opportunities.



But how does business marketing work on LinkedIn? And how should you go about building a LinkedIn content strategy?



Build Your Profile



Regardless of the size of your company, you'll need to build your LinkedIn profile before you start on your business marketing journey.



When you first create a LinkedIn account for your business, think about how you want to come across. People like narratives, so you should tell the story of your company somewhere on the page. Think about the tone you want to establish for your brand and use it on your LinkedIn profile.



Then, start making posts! Like all other&nbsp;social media&nbsp;platforms, LinkedIn is designed for sharing and interaction. Sharing articles from your company blog can establish you as a thought leader in your field. You can also post photos and videos designed to inform your audience.



You should also list any achievements or accomplishments for your company. This could include awards, certificates or even information on your education or qualifications.



Make sure you fill out as much information as possible. A filled-out, easy-to-read profile will help your followers engage with you.



Create Great Content



Next, you need to&nbsp;produce top-notch content. Maybe you're already doing this for your other social media platforms, but if not, now's the time to get started!



To create great content, think about what your audience wants to know more about. Pay attention to popular topics in your field or even check forums such as Reddit to see what questions people are asking. Then, produce blogs or videos about those topics!



Posting those to your LinkedIn page will help you generate more traffic and build your reputation as an authoritative source. You should always make sure your content is engaging and accurate.&nbsp;



You'll also want to create a great LinkedIn headline for business owner purposes. It should succinctly describe who you are and what you do.



Use LinkedIn Ads



Do you want to draw the most possible attention to your page?



If so, you should try&nbsp;LinkedIn Ads. This benefit of the LinkedIn profile for small business owners allows you to design ads and then push them to your target audience. This helps boost awareness of your company to relevant professionals and can help make sales. LinkedIn Ads are great for business marketing.



Ready to Start Using LinkedIn for Business Marketing?



Are you ready to harness the benefits of LinkedIn for business marketing?

# Mobile First Indexing: Why Is It Important?

Full Content:
Mobile first indexing is hitting the virtual market as businesses battle it out on the Google results page. If you're one of these business owners, you may be confused about what mobile first indexing even is and why it's so important for your business's growth.&nbsp;



What is mobile first indexing? Let's learn what it is and why it's important to SEO strategy as more users search on their mobile devices.&nbsp;



Mobile First Indexing: What Is It?



To put it into layman's terms, mobile first indexing is&nbsp;Google's new algorithm&nbsp;that rewards sites with excellent mobile design. More and more people are using their mobile devices to search the web. So it's important that your site works just as well on a phone as it does on a desktop or laptop.



This is to say that it's mobile&nbsp;first&nbsp;indexing, not mobile&nbsp;only&nbsp;indexing. If you only have a desktop site available, it can still be ranked on the google results page. However, your best bet for increasing your numbers is to develop an easy-to-use, functional mobile website.&nbsp;



How Mobile First Indexing Affects SEO and Rankings



Sites that are mobile friendly will start getting first dibs on the Google search results page. This means that you and your business are going to get the most traffic sent to your site if it has a great mobile interface and is optimized for SEO.&nbsp;



Unsure of your current SEO ranking? Sites like pixaura.com&nbsp;offer free SEO website audits&nbsp;that will show you the overall SEO health of your page. Starting there and then moving on to web design is going to be your best bet to optimizing your site.&nbsp;



Best Practices for Mobile First Indexing



Lucky for you, Google has posted&nbsp;its own guidelines&nbsp;for how to get your mobile site up to snuff in time for their mobile first index rollout. If you want a quick and easy idea of what to do, we've compiled some mobile first guidelines for you.




Structured Data and Metadata. Make sure to match both the structured data and metadata of your desktop site to the mobile version. They don't have to match exactly; in fact, it's more beneficial to have shorter titles on mobile versions.



Make sure that the content on your desktop site flows nicely on the mobile version. You may need to remove or replace some images and videos that don't function well on a mobile device.



Follow best practices for images (high-quality, supported formats, and alt-text) and videos (supported formats, easy-to-find spots within your site)



Page Speed is vital to customer service and high rankings on mobile first indexing. Use online resources to double-check just how fast your pages are loading and what you can do to speed it up.




Prepare for the Future



Fortunately, Google is still&nbsp;fine-tuning their new mobile first indexing algorithm, so you have time to make the necessary changes to your mobile site. Get ahead of the competition by optimizing now so that your business gains tons of new traffic by being first on Google's results page.



If you're having trouble with web design,&nbsp;we can assist you in making your mobile site beautiful and user-friendly.

Why Instagram Stories Have Power



Let’s start with why Instagram stories have such potential power. With the increase of influencer marketing and Instagram stories, the average feed post per week has gone down each year. When stories were introduced in 2016, the average number of feed posts per week from influencers was 3.3. Now in 2020, the average number of posts has dropped to 2.3.&nbsp;



Another perk of Instagram stories is that they are only up for 24 hours. This feature helps you to post more authentic and behind the scenes content that you may not normally post to your feed. This is a great feature to do employee spotlights or takeovers, Q&amp;A or content that just requires minimal post production. Everlane is a great example of this type of story content.&nbsp;



Since the introduction of stories, there have been several upgrades to engage your audience in different ways. These upgrades help to keep the conversation going about you, make your brand more personable and get quick feedback from your audience.&nbsp;

Why Instagram Stories are Engaging



Instagram has added so many features to Instagram stories that help increase engagement. These features are easy to use: polls, Q&amp;As, emoji sliders and more. If you add stickers like these to your stories a few times a week your audience engagement will definitely increase - which will then help your Instagram algorithm ranking.&nbsp;



Feature #1: Polls



Polls are a great way to get your audience to engage quickly. This is one of the fastest ways to get your audience involved and you get instant engagement boosts. Influencers and content creators often ask questions that seem meaningless, but they get tons of engagement for these Instagram stories without actually creating anything. It also helps build a strong sense of community as your audience feels included in decision making.&nbsp;



As a brand or business you can use these to ask your followers which product or color scheme they prefer, where they would use or wear a product or even use them to tap into current events that align with or support your company values.&nbsp;



Feature #2: Emoji Sliders



These are a great way to get quick reactions and are very versatile, thanks to the wide range of emojis you can use. Emoji stickers can also be used in more creative ways. Take a look at Lush Cosmetics for example. They regularly use polls or emoji sliders to see what kind of content their audience would like to see, which products they prefer or even to see what skin type their audience has and put together a skin routine based on the answers. Their creative use of these stickers is a great way to involve the audience. This encourages engagement and makes their audience more likely to take note of product recommendations.&nbsp;



Feature #3: Question &amp; Answer



These are a great way to engage your audience. You are able to get feedback, questions answered or questions asked in a timely manner. These enable you to either reply via DM or repost them as additional Instagram stories. Both help your audience feel seen and heard.&nbsp;



Feature #4: Quiz Stickers



Quiz Stickers offer light-hearted and easy ways to communicate with your audience. You can share details about your brand story, a product launch or test your audience on topics related to your brand.&nbsp;



Feature #5: Chat



One of Instagram’s more recent features is the ability to create and join a chat. These chats can host up to 32 participants and enable you to lead a group in conversation about a topic that you are interested in. This feature allows you to pick who gets to join the chat. Since there is a limited number of participants, chat can be utilized as a focus group for different product ideas or marketing concepts.&nbsp;



Feature #6: Live



This feature is a great way to catch the attention of your followers. When you go live, it sends a notification to your followers that you are going live. It is also a great way to encourage questions and comments from your audience.

Your Social Media Strategy



Instagram stories are another powerful asset in your social media toolbelt. A smart social media strategy can leverage Stories to interact with your existing audience and expand your online presence. Give it a try - what's to lose? Your story self-destructs in 24 hours!

# Why ADA Compliance Matters for Your Website

Full Content:
Is your website functioning within ADA compliance? If not, it should be. This allows your website accessibility to everyone, even those who have disabilities that affect their vision, hearing, or other physical limitations.



If you're not sure if your website is ADA compliant or you're wondering what its benefits are, keep reading. In this guide, we'll go over some of the key points of making sure you have an ADA-compliant web design.&nbsp;



You Can Widen Your Audience&nbsp;



If your site is not ADA compliant, you are missing out on potential customers and clients that cannot access or navigate your site due to a disability. Those with disabilities may be interested in your product or service but they cannot buy a product or get in contact with you if your website is only accessible for those without disabilities. This can cause you to lose potential customers to your competitors who do&nbsp;have an accessible website.&nbsp;



For instance, if you have videos or images, without captions or alt text, not everyone can use these visuals. These tools allow those that are deaf or blind to still be able to gain information from your website features. Additionally, your website should be fully accessible without a mouse so that those with physical limitations can still use it.&nbsp;



Improves Your SEO



When you make ADA-compliant updates to your website, you can get SEO benefits. Search engines like Google will scan your page to see if you have these updates. If you do, this will put your search engine ranking above those that don't. Google will favor your website because it's one that can be used by more online visitors.&nbsp;



For this reason, alternative image text, meta-tagging, and video transcripts should all be taken seriously when making updates to your website.&nbsp;



Improve Your Reputation



Not only does ADA compliance open your website up to more visitors, but these visitors are also more likely to become loyal customers. They will know that you value their business and that you prioritize making your website accessible to everyone. This is a great way to&nbsp;create customer loyalty. Additionally, if someone has a great experience with the ADA compliant features on your site, they are more likely to share your website with others.&nbsp;



This is a great way to get some positive press for your business while also putting you ahead of competitors. Making your website more comprehensible to all users means overall improved website usability for all. This allows everyone - disabled or not - to find the information they are looking for on your site quickly and easily.&nbsp;



This will work to convert visitors across the board, as they know they can easily access the information they need.&nbsp;



Avoid Penalties&nbsp;



Now that websites are so widely used, they are included in ADA general guidelines. Now that most businesses have a website, it's important that they are made accessible to everyone. ADA compliance works as a grading system.&nbsp;



All pages in your site need to be at least grade A compliant to qualify as an ADA compliant website. This grading system can go up to an AAA in compliance, which is the goal for all website hosts. Plenty of esteemed online brands have faced lawsuits and penalties for not making sure that their website is accessible to all.



If you want to avoid facing charges for not making your website ADA compliant, you should make all the necessary updates to your website now.&nbsp;



ADA Compliance: What Updates Need to Be Made?&nbsp;



Working to update your website to&nbsp;meet the ADA compliance guidelines&nbsp;can be a hefty process. However, with a team of experts, you can make sure your website is up to proper standards. These guidelines require that your website be perceivable, understandable, robust, and operable. To achieve the perceivable guideline, your website must be easy to access and process with no areas that are only available to those with hearing or sight.&nbsp;



This involves having alternative ways for people to enjoy your content, by using tools like alt text and audio transcripts. To make your site operable, you need to make sure your site is navigatable for all. This means that it should be able to be accessed without a keyboard or mouse while also making sure your site has no visual triggers, such as strobe lights that may cause seizures or migraines for some users.&nbsp;



To make your website understandable for all users, you need to make it easy for users to read the content. This means that you need an intuitive and predictable layout that makes it easy for website visitors to explore. A robust website will work with all browsers and assistive technologies.&nbsp;



As technologies update, your site will need to as well, as ADA compliance will continue to evolve.&nbsp;



Make ADA Compliant Updates to Your Site Today



To make sure your website is easy to use for all website visitors, you need to work with a professional to achieve ADA compliance. This is a no-brainer for any online business that wants to succeed, as it can help to widen your customer base while also avoiding costly fees. 



Are you looking for a company that can&nbsp;make ADA-compliant updates&nbsp;to your website? Contact us today to get started.

# Why Responsive Website Design Matters

Website design is rapidly evolving. Gone are the days where you only needed a minimal design made just for desktop computers.&nbsp;



Over 50% of website visits&nbsp;are from mobile users. This means that your website&nbsp;not only needs to be visually appealing, but also responsive on mobile.&nbsp;



Responsive websites&nbsp;adapt to create the best experience for the user. Ideally, your website&nbsp;can shapeshift your content so that it looks its best no matter what device your user is viewing it from.&nbsp;



Responsive website designs&nbsp;are imperative to attracting and maintaining viewers and clients.&nbsp;So, how do you make your website responsive?&nbsp;



Make Sure Your Website is Mobile Ready



When creating your responsive website, make sure to continuously check the mobile view of your website. On sites like Wix and WordPress, you can toggle between desktop and mobile view.&nbsp;



For&nbsp;your mobile website to be responsive, you might have to leave certain elements out. You might also need to condense certain blocks of text so that readers are not endlessly scrolling on their phones.



Make Your Images Responsive



Another part of making your website responsive is to ensure your images are coded to be responsive to screen size.&nbsp;



To do so, you're going to have to&nbsp;dive into the HTML code&nbsp;to make sure images are set to have more than one size, depending on the screen. Save yourself the trouble and hire a web designer to do this for you.&nbsp;



Use A Fluid Grid



In web design, a fluid grid is&nbsp;crucial to a responsive website. In older websites, elements are set on a page by pixel size. A fluid grid means that the elements on your website are set by columns and height and widths are scaled depending on the screen size.&nbsp;



In practice, this&nbsp;means instead of elements looking incredibly small on a mobile device, they are resized to account for the small screen.&nbsp;



Pay Attention to Typography



Typography can make or break your business website design. Fonts and text size play a powerful role in what your viewer takes away from your website. Because of this, your website typography also needs to be responsive to multiple devices.



When it comes to website typography, you might have to play around between size and boldness. Of course, you want the important text to be prominent on the page, but you also want it to look natural on a mobile device without taking up the whole screen.



Responsive Website Designs



Responsive website design takes time and skill.



While you can play around with a website template, you're better off creating a custom website with a professional web design team. Besides making your website responsive, our team can assist in&nbsp;SEO and maintenance. Our team at Pixaura will create a website for you that is responsive and looks amazing too.&nbsp;

# How to Determine Your Target Audience
> What is a Target Audience? A target audience is the group of people you want to reach with your online presence. Knowing your target audience helps you narrow down where and how you focus your marketing efforts. Your target audience&hellip;

What is a Target Audience?



A target audience is the group of people you want to reach with your online presence. Knowing your target audience helps you narrow down where and how you focus your marketing efforts. Your target audience is not everyone - they are the people most invested in your content, products and services. They typically have one mutual characteristic, which could be an interest, a demographic or the way they communicate. It is also important to note that you can still sell to everyone, but you cannot target everyone. Identifying your niche and using audience research helps you create relevant content, messages and ads. This can lead to higher conversion rates and better social media Return On Investment (ROI).&nbsp;



Tips &amp; Tricks to Determine Your Target Audience



1. Gather data on your current customers and audience



Looking at the characteristics of your current customers, you are able to compile these similarities and shared characteristics into at least one profile. Similarities could include:



AgeLocationLanguageSpending power and patternsInterestsChallengesStage of life



Understanding who is already buying from you can help you to better understand who would be most likely to be interested in your content, product or services in the future.&nbsp;



2. Conduct social listening research



Social listening is an easy way to find out what conversations are being held online about your business, industry and products. When you monitor relevant keywords and hashtags, you can reveal what people are saying about your company and competitors online, even if you are not tagged.&nbsp;



Social listening can also be used to do some deeper research into your target audience. Monitoring keywords and hashtags may lead you to other relevant keywords and hashtags that your target audience uses to help you find more relevant users.&nbsp;



3. Check in on the competition



It is very likely your audience overlaps with your competitors, so checking out what they’re doing can be very worthwhile. You can learn about mistakes they’ve already made, how they position themselves and see if they’re reaching audiences you haven’t thought of yet. It can also be beneficial to see what type of posts are doing well for them and which ones are not. If something is not working well for them, think of how you could improve it. Putting this together with the data you collected on our current customers can help you to broaden your audience reach to groups you may not have considered before.&nbsp;



4. Understand what your target audience is looking for from your social channels



To accomplish this, you need to understand how what you’re offering makes your audience’s life better, easier or more interesting. Once you have this understanding, it is important to consider how you can create value for your audience with your social channels. To do this, you should consider; What your audience’s main purchasing barriers are &amp; how can you help them overcome their barriers?; Where is your audience in the buying process? Are they researching, looking at reviews or ready to buy?; What is the kind of content that your audience typically engages with? If you are not able to determine this yourself, or need further clarification, you can always ask your audience through a survey.&nbsp;



5. Monitor your own content



Look back at previous posts or use an analytics tool to see how your posts have performed. See what is working well or resonating best with your audience and what your audience is engaging with. When you compare how different content performs, you can see what your audience really wants to see.

People value what others say about a product or service. Before purchasing, 91% of people read online reviews, 84% believe them, and 68% only need to read between one and six reviews to be convinced. You cannot control what others say. But you can respond to negative reviews in a way that helps your reputation, rather than hindering it.&nbsp;



Respond Promptly



When consumers leave a negative review, they often feel dissatisfied, angry, wronged, and/or misled. Do not stir the pot more by also making them feel unheard.



A&nbsp;Harvard Business Study&nbsp;found that companies that respond to customer comments within the hour were SIXTY times more likely to qualify the lead than those who waited a full day. The takeaway? Consumers appreciate attention.



When negative&nbsp;online reviews pop up, give yourself about an hour to think about it. Then, reply with a thoughtful response.



Make It Personal



While a simple "thank you" response can suffice for a complement, you must put more into it when responding to negative&nbsp;online reviews. Take a more formal approach to appear professional and sincere.



Starting with "Dear Guest" may irk them more as it feels generic. Also, throughout your response, it's important avoid using cookie-cutter phrases and cliches.



Instead, address them by using their name, and make it personal. Address specifics that they mention so that their concern feels heard and thought through.



Apologize



Not all apologies will work in your favor. Some sound condescending and can make things worse. Take care to apologize appropriately.



Read their complaint multiple times to ensure that you know exactly what to apologize for. If you say sorry for the wrong thing, they will dismiss your apology entirely.



Choose your words wisely. Do not begin with, "I'm sorry that you feel..." Instead, apologize directly to your end of the problem.



Do not kiss up to the customer in an apology to the point that it sounds insincere. Make it thoughtful and direct.



Take Ownership



Take ownership of the mistake. Do not apologize and then pass the blame onto them or anybody else.&nbsp;



Make zero excuses for what happened. Owning the mistake earns you respect. It also allows you to recognize what you did wrong. This sets you up to properly fix things.



Connect With the Reviewer



After making a public apology, state that you will connect with the reviewer offline to make things right. This lets outside viewers know that you will handle this issue further without making a show about how good you are at handling things.



Connect with the consumer by phone if possible to reconnect and show them the human behind the business. This will help them forgive the mistake.



Make It Right



Make the issue right after receiving negative customer reviews. Begin by stating how you plan to change whatever went wrong. Without this, the same thing will probably happen again in the future.



Then, offer the angry customer something that helps them feel understood. This shows you care about their concerns and want to make an effort to improve things.



How to Respond to Negative Reviews



Learn how to respond to negative reviews and practice it. Learn and grow from your mishaps and show customers that you care.

# 7 Ways to Quickly Increase Your Social Media Engagement

Full Content:
In today’s world of online businesses and social media, building relationships with your audience or customers is crucial to increasing your engagement. When your audience interacts with your posts, you have the opportunity to respond with something funny (but appropriate), offer above and beyond customer service or just answer the question. These interactions will help you build stronger customer loyalty than if you were to not respond to them.&nbsp;



1. Create Unique Content



Creating unique and different content is very important, especially when you are just starting out or are a smaller business. You can make your content unique by adding images, videos or visuals. It can be beneficial to post a mix of your own content in addition to popular content you’ve found, with credit of course. However, make sure the content you are sharing is relevant to your target audience.&nbsp;



2. Be Active



When you post and engage with customers regularly, people will be more likely to follow you. People like when they see businesses interact with their audience. It is also important to respond to all comments, regardless of whether it is positive or negative. Showing appreciation for positive comments and offering a solution to the negative comments makes you come across as more trustworthy. You may also find it helpful to schedule posts each week using a scheduling tool like Sendible, Hootsuite or Later so you don’t have to be on your phone to send a post. 



3. Share Valuable Content&nbsp;



Your content should be helpful and address your audience’s needs or pain points. Instead of “broadcasting” your message to the masses, try to make it more conversational and almost like a community. Your followers may also find it valuable when you share other people’s content. For example, if another social media feed is able to offer your audience relevant information, they’ll be interested in your brand and encouraged to follow you even if it wasn’t your original post - be sure to give credit to the original writer, though!



4. Analyze your Engagement&nbsp;



It is also important to assess how much social media engagement you typically get now. This means how many followers you have and how many likes, shares and comments you typically get on each post. Tracking these allows you to see which posts are getting more engagement versus the ones that aren’t getting as much attention. This will help you determine what to post, and when, so you can reach the maximum target audience possible.&nbsp;



5. Know Your Audience&nbsp;



Knowing your audience can help you determine what social media sites to be on, when to publish, the type of content you publish and your brand voice. This will also help you determine your social media strategy. This strategy depends on what your brand is and what your business has to offer. Companies with younger audiences will use Instagram or Twitter more than Facebook. Companies with older audiences will most likely use Facebook. Certain companies are also able to use more relaxed language than others. For example, fast food chains like Wendy’s tend to have fun social media presences where they engage with random accounts. Wendy’s is able to do this since they are already an established restaurant and have built trust with customers. A place like a dentist office may have a more serious tone since they still have to prove their trustworthiness.&nbsp;



6. Keep Conversation Flowing



Since a good portion of customer engagements are online or through social media, it is important to practice both reactive and proactive engagement. Reactive engagement is when you respond to any direct messages, mentions or comments. Proactive engagement is when you spark the conversation with those who might be talking about you, but have not sent you any messages directly. For proactive engagements it is important to track indirect messages as well so you can see who’s talking about you. You may also find it beneficial to track indirects that use a nickname or common misspelling. Tracking indirects allows you to get a broader grasp of what people are saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;



7. Repost Customer or Follower Posts



Customers love to feel appreciated. When a customer has their post shared, they feel recognized and special. This can also lead to them reposting/sharing the fact that they got recognized or screenshotting proof that you liked or retweeted their post, which could mean more exposure for you!

# Unplug! 5 Benefits of Decreasing Your Screen Time

We are big fans of all things digital here - obviously. But even we know it's important to break away from the hold that our devices can hold over us. In fact, we Americans spend more time in front of a screen than we do sleeping! We average ten and a half hours every day in front of computer and television screens. 



Some of that screen time is necessary. We have to work and connect with family and friends.



But we don't need to spend so much time - even reducing screen time by one hour can help. There are substantial health benefits of disconnecting from technology, and you can learn about five of them right here.&nbsp;



1. You'll Sleep Better



Screens produce blue light, which is similar to sunlight at noontime. This tricks our brains into believing that it IS noon! In turn, it doesn't produce melatonin, a hormone that induces sleep, so we stay up for longer periods.&nbsp;



Unplug from technology at least one hour before going to bed. You can use a lamp or another light, as long as it's not blue. Read, go out for a walk, or talk with friends.&nbsp;



2. You'll See Better



The same blue light that keeps us up at night also strains our eyes. It induces the eyes to not blink. The eyes start to dry out, which makes vision blurrier and less precise.&nbsp;



When you need to do work on a computer, take a break every 20 minutes. Look at something non-electronic 20 feet away from you for 20 seconds.&nbsp;



You should otherwise limit your screen time to two hours. Do paperwork and perform other tasks away from the screen.&nbsp;



3. Your Back Will Feel Better



A 2010 study&nbsp;of more than 31,000 people found that every hour spent on computers increases the odds of backache by 9 percent. When sitting at a computer desk, we slouch over. This forces our spines to support the weight of our heads, which stresses the spine.&nbsp;



Getting up and moving around takes the pressure off the back. You can stretch, increasing blood flow to the spine and muscles.&nbsp;



4. You Will Experience Deeper Social Connections&nbsp;



A 2014 study&nbsp;examined students at an outdoor education camp. They didn't use screens for five days, and the scientists tested them on their nonverbal emotional skills. They were able to read nonverbal cues better than they had before.&nbsp;



Spend time talking to people, even complete strangers. You will notice facial expressions and body language that you've never noticed before. You can learn how to modulate your voice, sounding more confident and intelligent.&nbsp;



When you return to&nbsp;social media, you can use your newly-acquired skills. You can get new followers and develop your brand further.&nbsp;



5. Your Memory Will Improve



The brain makes connections amongst neurons every second. But the Internet bombards the brain with information. The neurons cannot connect in time, and our memory suffers from it.&nbsp;



Reading and writing occur at a slow enough pace that the brain can develop memories. When you need to take notes, handwrite them.&nbsp;



Go out for a walk and give your brain a break. Feel the ground beneath your feet and look up at the sky. You will gain a richer memory of your environment when you give yourself time to take it all in.&nbsp;



The Benefits of Less Screen Time



There are better things we can do with our day than staring at a screen. Reducing our screen time has many benefits.&nbsp;



Unplug from the screen an hour before going to bed. Look away every 20 minutes to rest your eyes. Get up and stretch to reduce strain on your back.&nbsp;



Unplug for several days to improve your social skills. To facilitate your memory, read and write. Go for a walk to let your brain relax.&nbsp;



When you *are* using your screen, get expert advice. Pixaura is Cincinnati's leading digital marketing agency.&nbsp;Contact us&nbsp;today.&nbsp;

We've all been there.  January 1st comes and we make our New Year's Resolutions.



"I'm going to lose 10 pounds!"  "I'm going to read more!"  "I'll be smarter with my money."



By mid-January (or maybe February if we're really motivated,) we're back to our normal routines, our resolutions a forgotten relic of a more hopeful time. One study found that only 46% of New Year's resolutions stick. So how do you actually keep yours?  



Top New Year's Resolutions



Exercise moreSave moneyLose weightEat betterLearn a new skill &nbsp;Quit smokingTravel moreRead more



S.M.A.R.T. Goals



If you're familiar with "SMART" goals, you'll immediately see what's wrong with these resolutions. When you set goals using the SMART method, you are laying the groundwork that increases your odds of success.







Specific



When you write your resolution, get detailed.  An articulated goal that is clear and well defined can provide a path forward.



Measurable



How will you know if you've achieved your goal without measuring it?  The proper metric can help you track your progress, which becomes even more important for long-term goals.  Quantify your resolution!



Achievable



Setting goals that can't be accomplished is a surefire way to destroy your motivation. A worthwhile goal should challenge you but also be attainable.



Realistic



Do you believe you can achieve your goal? If your gut answer is "no," you've likely set an unrealistic expectation. Consider the resources and time available to you when setting your goal.



Timely



It's imperative you give yourself a deadline. No time constraints = no urgency = no motivation.  A healthy dose of pressure will help you make consistent progress.



SMART in Practice



Old resolution: "I want to lose weight."



SMART resolution: "I will lose 15 pounds this year. I will start walking for 30 minutes at least 3 days each week. I will track my active time using a fitness tracker, and check my progress at the end of each week. On the 1st of every month I will weigh myself to evaluate. If I am not losing at least a pound each month from increasing my walking, I will join a gym and begin working with a personal trainer." 



Tips &amp; Tricks



1. Set a Goal for YOU 



Many of us make New Year's resolutions that we see others around us making. But it's critical that your goal reflects your inner desires and your priorities. A spouse, boss, or partner may pressure you into a resolution, but it will stand little to no chance of success if you don't truly want it.



2. Reduce "Activation Effort" 



The less time it takes you to get started, the more likely you'll actually get started. If you want to finally learn how to play that instrument, don't keep it in the closet. Similarly, if your goal is to spend less money, reduce your access to it.  Spending cash instead of swiping a debit or credit card will make you more aware of how much you spend - while also limiting you to only what you have on you.



3. Focus 



Don't spread yourself too thin. You only have so much mental energy, and if you burn yourself out, you won't accomplish anything! Commit to tackling one or two resolutions thoroughly instead of multiple resolutions poorly. Bonus: completing one goal can boost your belief in yourself for your next resolution.



"Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing."Ron Swanson



4. Share Your Resolutions 



Accountability from others can be the difference between success and failure. If you need to answer for your progress to more than just yourself, it can help you put in effort on those days you really don't feel like it. It's not only about avoiding their guilt-trips; when you complete your resolution, they'll be there to celebrate with you!



5. Automate Where Possible 



Smartphones have changed almost everything, and they can help with your resolutions too. Using calendars, reminder apps, to-do lists, and/or task management software can keep you on track. They won't do the work for you, but a timely reminder can make a world of difference.



6. Avoid Willpower 



The more challenging the resolution, the more willpower required, which depletes your mental resolve and endurance. Humans are susceptible to "decision fatigue" - as we make more choices, we lose our ability to make good decisions. So if your resolution is to eat healthier, don't keep junk food around. Less temptation = more willpower.



7. Reward Yourself 



Lasting change takes time, and it's important that you celebrate along the way, not just at the finish line. Acknowledge success as you make progress, and make it fun! And if slip ups happen, don't beat yourself up about it - just get back on the wagon. It's about being consistent, not perfect.



Remember Your "Why"



Making real changes in your life can be difficult. 



But your attitude may be more important than any of these tips. 



If you focus on the negative, you'll end up discouraged. 



On the other hand, focusing on the positive will help you stick to your New Year's resolution.

Full Content:
More and more people worldwide have access to the internet. Customers feel that online shopping is more helpful than going outside to buy items at a physical store. E-commerce websites differ from typical websites in significant ways. What are the fundamental prerequisites that make it simple for clients to buy from you?&nbsp;This article discusses five essential requirements for an effective e-commerce solution.



Payment Systems



A significant component to consider is the payment system for your shopping cart. Clients should have the option to use their preferred payment method. The merchant determines which types of payment it accepts. This could include mobile payments, credit cards and services like Google Wallet and PayPal.



How is your customers' information protected? Can your customers safely secure their payment on your website so they don't need to enter their details each time they make a purchase? Do all that you can to limit obstructions between a plan to purchase and a finished purchase.



Mobile-Friendly Website and Storefront&nbsp;



Mobile commerce, also known as m-commerce, is on the rise.&nbsp;



Expanded cell phone utilization has massively affected internet commerce development, permitting buyers to purchase within minutes, regardless of their physical location. Ecommerce stores that are not upgraded for mobile create a poor user experience at best, or compel them to leave your site at worst. Helpful mobile-friendly features optimize how your website and storefront both look and function. 



Customizable Themes and Templates&nbsp;



An appealing, proficient website is critical to your online store's success. However, not every person has the coding aptitude to create a site, or the assets to employ a website developer. All things being equal, effective e-commerce software should offer a collection of layouts that can be tweaked to mirror your brand's image.



Customization should be quick and simple, with intuitive stages that let the website owner rework components with only a couple of clicks. A professional-looking layout is also important for your brand identity, such as your logo and business cards. Business Cards is a free resource tool that helps create the professional business card you need.



Integration of Third-Party Apps



If you use or plan to utilize business applications, the capacity to incorporate them with your online store will simplify maintaining your online business. Rather than having to import information manually, compatible business applications will do this for you, sparing you loads of time.



Shopify, for example, incorporates with accounting solutions TaxJar and QuickBooks and also integrates AfterShip and ShipStation for shipping deliveries. Whether you need to generate financial reports or prepare shipments, the information you require will be ready when you are.&nbsp;



Customer Support and Interface&nbsp;



Whether you need technical support or have payment questions, it's always disappointing when a service provider isn't accessible. Not all e-commerce solutions have a similar degree of support for customers, so ensure the one you pick is there when you need assistance.



There are various client services available. For example, Bigcommerce, Shopify and others offer email, phone, user guides, live chat, and community forums. Great customer service helps retain your current customers and find new ones. A simple to-use interface will let your clients get prompt help when they need it.



Conclusion&nbsp;



Each organization is unique, and the business landscape is constantly changing. According to Statista, 71% of consumers believe that online stores give them what they want better than actual stores. Does your e-commerce solution have the basic highlights and usefulness needed to maintain a profitable business?



This article has provided you with the basics to develop an effective e-commerce website. Implement these fundamental requirements and watch your online business flourish.

# The Ultimate Guide to CBD Marketing
> The CBD market is booming. But it is also becoming saturated with competition, increasing the demand for effective CBD marketing. It's critical to learn how to stand out, differentiate your brand, and show potential customers why they should choose you.&hellip;

The CBD market is booming. But it is also becoming saturated with competition, increasing the demand for effective CBD marketing. It's critical to learn how to stand out, differentiate your brand, and show potential customers why they should choose you. Although CBD is completely legal, a host of regulations control CBD advertising. 



If you want to market your CBD products legally and effectively, you will need a detailed strategy...and some out-of-the-box thinking.



CBD ADVERTISING REGULATION



Google and Facebook dominate the digital advertising game, offering scalable, affordable ways to display promotional content. Unfortunately, although CBD is legal, it is still classified as dangerous by the federal government. And Google and Facebook agree. 



You may be able to temporarily slip by their filters using terms like green, alternative medicine, and natural plant-based remedies, but you'll eventually be caught, and you can - and will - be shut down. Other major platforms similarly restrict CBD advertising. So how can you fight back? Let's take a look at your options.



ALTERNATIVE CBD MARKETING



Native Advertising



Consumer dislike advertising. To be more specific, they hate bad and disruptive ads. Native advertising attempts to change this dynamic through well-placed ads that engage the audience rather than disrupting user experience. 



Native ads are branded messages that fit seamlessly with their environment. If the ad pairs well with the website's existing content, the result is a natural looking ad - one which is more likely to lead to a conversion. Top native advertising platforms that are CBD-friendly include Outbrain, Taboola and Mantis.



Influencer Partnerships



Cringe, right? Not so fast. 



Influencers aren't just millennials who need attention. They're a valuable medium for marketing your product. By tapping into their existing, engaged follower base, you can reach a targeted audience while bypassing advertising restrictions. 



In addition to eliminating the risk of getting shut down, the influencer's credibility functions as an endorsement of your product. Research has shown that 90% of customers trust recommendations from others - even strangers - more than what a brand says about themselves. Cultivating a grassroots network of influencers as brand advocates can increase your brand's visibility and social following.



Display Advertising



Google isn't the only source of display advertising. There are several alternative platforms that advertisers can use to display advertisements on domains that allow CBD-related ads. The main players in this arena are FieldTest and HealthyAds.



Affiliate Marketing



With affiliate marketing, fees are based on performance. If your product sells, the affiliate earns a commission. If it doesn't sell, they don't. This low-risk method functions similarly to pay-per-click ads and can generate a healthy amount of qualified traffic. Consider Affiliate Window and ShareASale if you're interested in this marketing tactic.



Podcast Advertising



Podcast advertising is growing rapidly. In fact, ad spend is expected to double in the next few years. Like influencer marketing, advertising on podcasts is effective at leveraging an already existing audience. It can sometimes be expensive, but it is a terrific way method of boosting brand awareness. When your ads run in relevant podcasts (similar to native advertising,) they function quite well. Our go-to podcast advertising services include AudioGo and Midroll. 



OTT Advertising



OTT, or over-the-top, refers to a service or device that streams digital content. This includes include smart tv's, game consoles, streaming boxes and more. OTT ads are&nbsp;similar to TV ads, but they are not subject to CBD advertising restriction because they are delivered through streaming media. Projections for OTT ad revenue forecast a significant increase in the coming decade.



DON'T IGNORE TRADITIONAL MARKETING STRATEGIES



Search Engine Optimization (SEO)



SEO is a proven digital marketing tactic to sell any product, including CBD. Developing and optimizing your website's structure and content improves your search engine rankings for CBD-related terms.



Local SEO



If you have a physical storefront, Local SEO&nbsp;is a must. These marketing tactics ensure consumers in your area who are searching for businesses like yours find you!



Email Marketing



The more things change, the more they stay the same. And when it comes to communicating with customers, email marketing remains consistent, effective and affordable.



Billboards



Sometimes you've just gotta go old school.

In many ways, the pandemic has showcased the value of going digital. In a contactless world, having an online presence has become a necessity.&nbsp; While we know one day we'll "return to normal," we believe today's digital surge is here to stay. Pixaura is looking towards the light at the end of the tunnel. We're sharing marketing trends that could brighten up your digital landscape in 2021.




1. Video Content



We think it's time to consider adopting video on social platforms like&nbsp;TikTok, Youtube,&nbsp;Facebook Live&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram Live, as they continue to&nbsp;grow in popularity. This content will give your fans the human touch they're craving, and it'll help you build consumer trust.





2. Live Chat



Messenger apps have become popular communication channels for businesses, especially for customer service issues.&nbsp;Some popular messenger apps are&nbsp;Facebook Messenger,&nbsp;WhatsApp,&nbsp;Instagram Direct,&nbsp;Twitter Direct&nbsp;and&nbsp;WeChat. Besides, who wants to sit on the phone?





3. Interactive Marketing



Engage your followers and give them an incentive to participate. 



Some fun ways to interact with your audience include quizzes, polls and surveys, calculators, and our favorite -&nbsp;contests.&nbsp;





4. Influencer Marketing



Today's customers don't listen to just anyone. We see a lot of selling on social networks, driven largely by&nbsp;influencers. For engagement &amp; reach, an influencer may offer a great ROI. You're getting more than a positive review - you're getting someone with a highly engaged, dedicated audience giving YOU credibility. 





5. Social Shops



Social platforms like&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pinterest&nbsp;make shopping online much easier now that users can make purchases without leaving the app. Pretty cool, right? And while many B2C consumers are utilizing this channel, B2B companies shouldn't ignore the possibility. Selling online has never been so easy!





6. Streaming Service Ads



Radio &amp; cable audiences are declining. Around 6.6 million U.S. households cut the cord in 2020, according to eMarketer.&nbsp;And while ad budgets for television &amp; radio decrease, promotions on streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, iHeart Radio, TuneIn, and Hulu are at an all-time high.&nbsp;





7. Email Marketing



You have a list of clients/customers - now what?&nbsp;Send targeted emails to capture their attention and use data to personalize the message. Some of our favorite platforms are MailChimp, Hubspot and Apollo (for sales.) Each of these has the ability to customize the user journey through email automation, too. Winner, winner, chicken dinner.




The Classics 



Digital marketing is essential to any business's success - we see this NOW MORE THAN EVER. 



And while marketing trends come and go, we continue to see these as must-haves: 






Webpages Built for Conversions



Search Engine Optimization



Google Ads







Social Media Marketing



Online Reviews



Local SEO

Humans are visual beings. The brain has millions of neurons that respond to visual cues and carry signals to the brain. This provides marketers a phenomenal opportunity to tap into the power of visual marketing and design to boost engagement and sales.&nbsp;



Let’s dive in and look at the most effective techniques and tools for social media.



Which design apps are best?&nbsp;







With the right apps, you can still create professional-looking images and visual content - even without formal training or qualifications. Here are some of our favorites.&nbsp;



1. Graphic design&nbsp;



There are numerous graphic design tools out there, and many of them are free. When choosing one, it’s important to consider how easy they are to use and the features they offer.&nbsp;



Tools like SNAPPA and PicMonkey are becoming increasingly popular because of their easy-to-use interface.&nbsp;



These apps offer a selection of templates that can be used on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other major platforms. They can also help you make images for ads, cover photos, posts, and more.&nbsp;



2. Logo builders&nbsp;



If you don’t have a logo on your social media accounts yet, you could be missing out on a chance to build better brand recognition and boost customer loyalty.&nbsp;



Using a consistent and recognizable logo on all social media accounts helps build your brand's identity. For a logo you can use on all your platforms, you can use a free online tool like LogoCreator. 



3. Picture editing&nbsp;



If you want to make your images more unique, image editing and graphic design apps are a great tool to use. Tools like BeFunky can be edit photos using filters, templates, and collage builders.&nbsp;



In addition, if you need to resize your images, there are a number of free tools available to do this. Some popular desktop version options include Imageresize or PicResize.



4. Post Scheduling



With Sked Social, “auto-posting” actually means auto-posting — no more notifications to post at 6:42 PM on a Saturday. It streamlines your entire Instagram social media process. 



The Planner is a perfect feature to help create consistency in how you want your IG feed to look, along with the simplicity to edit and move images, instantly providing the exact overall look!



Design tips for social media marketing&nbsp;







When you’re creating images for social media, it’s important to understand some key design principles. By applying these to your design work, you can create professional images that will drive results.



1. Using color&nbsp;



Many consumer decisions are based on snap judgements. Color makes a huge impact, as it can evoke different emotions in the viewer and change the way they view your brand.&nbsp;



For example, red and orange portray energy and urgency, while yellow is optimistic and youthful. Blue is viewed as calming and trustworthy, and black can show sleekness and professionalism.&nbsp;



2. Balance and symmetry&nbsp;



Balance is a key factor in the effectiveness of design work. This can be achieved in an image in four ways: symmetrical, asymmetrical, radial (spiral,) or crystallographic.&nbsp;



For illustrations, photos, graphics, and logos, balance can evoke a feeling of harmony and demonstrate higher levels of trustworthiness in a brand - so it needs to be used wisely!&nbsp;



3. Types of fonts&nbsp;



Selecting the right fonts for infographics, quotes, and other text can tie your images and words together seamlessly and bring your social media content to life.&nbsp;



This element has a big impact on how your design is viewed by the audience and can send different messages. Pick a font that compliments your other design work, while limiting it to a maximum of 3 different fonts. Be sure to pick a size that fits well on the platform.&nbsp;



Final thoughts&nbsp;



If you’ve dabbled in design work, you already know it can be time-consuming and tough to get right.&nbsp;



But with powerful tools, the best design apps, and the right knowledge, you can create awesome visual content that will raise your social media game to the next level.&nbsp;

B2B vs B2C (and B2G)



Let's knock out a couple definitions.



B2B: business to business.B2C: business to consumer.B2G: business to government.



The way sales occur, and the methods of marketing used, in these segments differs greatly. Ideally, gaining customers would be simple and straightforward - they see your product, they buy your product. But this is far from reality in the B2B world.



The average person is only familiar with marketing aimed at them, which typically takes the form of advertising. B2B marketing certainly involves some advertising, but it is only a fraction of the job. In fact, the most common budget expense for B2B marketers is live events - often eating up half the budget!



Attribution Window



An attribution window is generally defined as the period of relevant time before the purchase, and we use it to track which marketing efforts led to the successful sale. Different segments of the economy use different windows. For example, you probably don't spend much time choosing which gas station to visit to refill your tank. But I'd guess you spent several weeks deciding which car to buy.



In the B2B world, the attribution window is much longer - months or years are quite standard. As a B2B marketer, you should expect to strike out - a lot. Some contacts will become actual leads, few of those will become legitimate prospects, and even less of those will become sales. There are several reasons the B2B decision making process is more thorough.



Complexity



As a consumer, you almost always buy finished products. You simply buy an iPhone. But in the B2B world, there are many steps between raw and refined. Apple is certainly not producing all those parts internally. A company may sell glass to a company who makes camera lenses, who then sells them to Apple. Now consider all the different components of that phone. There are multiple layers in the B2B world, and at all of them, there is marketing.



Cost/Size



The most expensive thing I've bought was a house. Probably you, too. But in the B2B world, it isn't unusual for purchases to run into the millions of dollars. In addition to the cost, the quantity of an item purchased can be numerous. Imagine shopping for a new telecommunications system or shelving for a store like Target, with its 2000 locations. 



Justification



If you want to buy a new pair of shoes, who do you have to explain your purchase to? Maybe a significant other, but generally speaking, you choose the shoes you like. You may make your decision simply on emotional or impulse.



In the B2B world, there's little room for emotion. You are buying products or service used by someone else. You are also spending money that belongs to someone else. The owners or shareholders may ask why the vendor you chose presented the best solution - or even why there was a need at all. 



How This Affects You



Let's run down a list of things you'll need to do differently.



Website Design



B2B consumers are going to be more knowledgeable about your product or service, so your website should be professional and authoritative. Focus on the benefits you're offering to their business. Consider what the buyer's purpose is, and build your website around that. Many B2B buyers respond to content that reinforces they are making the right decision - these purchases are almost always long-term and consequential.



Customer Relationships



Repeat and referral business is critical to B2B companies. Your sales team should connect personally with buyers and build a relationship. They can (and will need to) further explain your product, its costs, benefits, etc. They are also facing a key opportunity to differentiate your business from its competitors. Your brand's personality can make all the difference.



Open Communication



Selling B2C is highly transactional. Marketing efforts are geared almost entirely to convincing a customer to complete a purchase. You meet your goal of selling the product. In the B2B world, you may not want to sell your product. Wild, right? Doing business with another company often requires the relationship to benefit both parties. What do you do if the buyer isn't a fit for you?



Advertising



Your B2B business likely operates in a niche market. It's therefore imperative that you completely understand your audience. Rely on demographics data and speak their language. Consider their pain points, their search intent and the potential touchpoints in their purchasing journey. 



In B2B marketing, you need to expose your product not just to the target company, but to the decision maker. And purchases are rarely the responsibility of a single individual. Group decisions are the norm, adding more time, and more complexity.



B2B buyers are significantly invested in the ROI of their purchases. They are also looking for thorough, educational, detailed content. What are the benefits you offer? Does your product save time, money, resources? What does your company provide before, during, after the sale? 



Onboarding



Do. Not. Overlook. This.



The onboarding process is critical. As mentioned above, the B2B world is about relationships. Plan out each step of onboarding to ensure it is smooth and efficient. Automate where you can. Use intake forms. Follow up. Ask only for the information you need. Choose, and commit to, a communication channel - the one they prefer. Repeat business is the name of the game, and stressful processes do not lead to retained customers. 



Do You Need a B2B Marketing Agency?



Are you looking to increase your ROI? Of course you are. This means more than just the financial return. Consider the time your employees can work on other matters.



Do you have the bandwidth? Long cycles require a different level of capacity. An agency can handle everything from marketing to analytics while you concentrate on what you do best.



Are you knowledgeable about B2B marketing? There's little room for error, and the sales funnel is anything but linear. An agency's expertise may be invaluable. (Psst. We think we're the agency for you.)

Think With Google continues to push the boundaries of analytics. In May 2020, they rolled out a new feature - Rising Retail Categories. The data available through this tool has a wealth of possibilities, and has never been released by Google before.



Consumer Behavior



Would your benefit business from knowing what consumers are searching for? Particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, when discretionary spending is lower in nearly every retail segment? Consumer behavior tends to shift quickly, but the pandemic has introduced a heightened level of unpredictability. Google's Rising Retail Categories intends to be a solution by highlighting:



retail categories that are growingwhere the growth is occurringthe search queries associated with these categories



Google displays growth for the latest week, month and year, and the data is updated daily. This frequency of updates is critical, as product search is dynamic and evolves rapidly. 



Holiday Shopping



As we head into the winter months, it's easy to picture Black Friday, crowded malls and presents under the tree. But it's 2020! Like almost everything, holiday shopping will be very different. Retailers rely heavily on the holiday season, even in a normal year. In a pandemic, success may hinge upon your ability to respond quickly to changing trends. 



Early research suggests that shoppers will do more online purchasing this year. When they do visit a store, they'll probably have a planned shopping list. But if these forecasts are inaccurate? Have contingency plans in place if the winds change.



Shoppers have been moving online for some time. But if things move further digital, as we suspect, the data available through tools like Rising Retail Categories could prove to be invaluable.



Pixaura, Google &amp; You



To stay up to date on consumer insights and the future of marketing, follow Think with Google. 



For help with your digital marketing strategies, contact us. We'd love to help your retail business thrive this holiday season!

# Google Ads 101

It can be intimidating and overwhelming when you're getting started with Google Ads. Diving in without a solid understanding of how Pay-Per-Click (PPC) ads work can be a costly mistake. We've been in the Google Ads game a long time, so we've put together a primer to help you grasp the basics of display advertising.



Google vs. The Other Guys



An incredible amount of traffic flows through Google. In a single day, over 250 million unique users will visit the site. In fact, there are 85,515 searches EACH SECOND. That's some serious traffic, and some serious opportunity. Google isn't the only website in the search game, but they dominate their competition. Below you'll find a chart displaying the market shares of leading search engines over the past decade. Do you even notice the "other guys?"



Search Engine Market Share 2010-2020



How Google Works



Ads (paid results) appear first and are clearly marked. If there are map results, they will be shown next. Finally, organic (SEO/unpaid) search results display. If you'd like to learn more about SEO, we've discussed some strategic aspects here.



But how does Google determine which ads to show? And how do you make sure your ads are chosen?




Google Ads (PPC)



Google Organic Results (SEO)




Pay-Per-Click



Google Ads (previously known as Google AdWords) works like an auction. After determining search queries that you would like your ad to appear for, you set a maximum bid amount that you're willing to pay. However, you only pay that amount if they click your ad. An ad that is displayed but isn't clicked costs you nothing. Hence, the name Pay-Per-Click (PPC.)



Google Ads deviate from a regular auction in a few important ways. First, the highest bidder doesn't always win. Quality score is a ranking system that Google uses that affects which ads are shown. Your quality score is based on your landing page's content and how well it matches both the search term and the search intent. 



High quality + relevance = high click-through-rates (CTR's.) Creating content that Google loves does more than increase your ad rankings. Quality content also lowers your cost-per-click and improves your organic rankings. Win-win.



Analytics



Good news if you're hesitant: Google doesn't leave you in the dark, wondering if your ads are working. Google Analytics provides a wealth of analytics data regarding your keywords, relevance scores, CTR's, conversion tracking, and more. You'll be able to evaluate your Google Ads campaign performance and adjust accordingly.



How Pixaura Can Help



Sound simple? Probably not. The competitive aspect of Google Ads means you've gotta stay on top of things on an almost daily basis. Your ads can get more complex; you may need to bid on your own company name - because your competitors certainly are. The last thing you want is to show up first in organic results, but have several competitors' ads shown first!



Industries have different levels of competition that determine the ad costs you can expect. For an estimate on how much revenue you could see in your particular industry, check out our Google Ads calculator.

Burger King launched a $40 million ad campaign in November 1985 called "Where's Herb?" The idea was to find a character named Herb who'd never had a Burger King burger. Herb would drop in to random locations, and customers could be rewarded if they found him at their local restaurant. This would, hypothetically, drive traffic to the stores.



However, other chains flipped the campaign to their own benefit. They pointed out that if Herb wasn't at B.K., it meant he probably liked other chains' burgers more. Unsurprisingly, B.K. profits fell 40% in 1986. The campaign didn't drive traffic AND their customers gained. Lose-lose.




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3d_uUNuLWc




What do we have to say about this? 



Don't go searching for Herb! 



Where's the benefit?  So, B.K.'s burgers taste great because some dude named Herb hasn't been there before? This is just silly-stupid-and-not-worth-$40-MILLION! When developing strategies for your marketing campaigns, it helps to consider potential drawbacks - including how a competitor may benefit, not you. 



There are times when you can preemptively discuss your weaknesses as a campaign, instead of waiting for your competitors to use it against you. Generally speaking, however, you should discuss your strengths. You should discuss how your product or service solves a problem for your customer.



Persona-based Criteria



Pixaura can help you create personas and custom strategies to find real customers that want to shop at your store or buy your service. Get in touch today to get started. Let us put our resources and experience to use for you. We truly believe your success is our success.

# Pixaura + P&amp;G: STANDOUT Virtual Campus

P&amp;G STANDOUT / Emerging Leaders Camp is a program that invites the brightest college students from around the nation to participate in a 1 week program. Thousands of students apply, and only 200 are selected to come to Cincinnati and learn more about P&amp;G and their specific Function (a P&amp;G business term defining department). At the end of the week, the departments interview the Standout Students and select some for internships at P&amp;G.



The Challenge



However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, P&amp;G could not host this year's camp as planned. They needed a way to communicate with the students virtually. So P&amp;G asked AGAR to create a virtual version of the event. AGAR then selected Pixaura to design and develop the website that would be the central hub for all communication. 



“It always seems impossible until it is done.”- Monica Turner, the leader of P&amp;G Sales, quoting Nelson Mandela.




https://vimeo.com/447951082




The Solution



Within a short, 6-week window, AGAR and Pixaura created a truly interactive site that had the following features and Functions: 



HomePage - Immersive 3D space where students selected the following sections of the site. Pixaura worked with CLMotion to create the 3D experience. Connect - In this section, the students shared their picture, email, phone, and social media links. The students could also chat with other students within the program. Notifications - P&amp;G could notify the students of upcoming events and other pertinent information Chat - P&amp;G and AGAR answered all student questions Interview - This section included a helpful 'tips' video and told the student the day/time of their interviewCitizenship - This section explained P&amp;G's 5 pillars of Citizenship: Community Impact, Corporate Ethics and Responsibility, Diversity and Inclusion, Environmental Sustainability, and Gender Equality. Tours - This section shared video tours of the potential locations that students might intern: Cincinnati Global HQ, Charlotte, Chicago, Nashville, Orlando, Fayetteville, Minneapolis, Seattle, and Boise Smale - An interactive VR space with videos from David Taylor and other P&amp;G leaders End to End - Interactive VR space with information about P&amp;G and the departments: Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Family Care, Global Business Services. Homebase - Another VR experience with a photobooth, videos, and audio 







“We’re taking what we’ve learned about working virtually during Covid to get super-creative in recruiting students for our summer intern class of 2021,” P&amp;G spokeswoman&nbsp;Beth Pohlmeyer&nbsp;told me. “The result is a highly interactive and visual online program. … The experience is pretty amazing.”-BizJournals



Pixaura + P&amp;G



We value our relationship with P&amp;G, having worked on their Annual Report previously. It's an honor to have been involved in such an exciting project. The virtual campus was a hit with the Standout students!



"I am so thankful for this experience and to have been able to connect with so many inspiring leaders, as well as my fellow HR peers. I also just wanted to point out HOW COOL P&amp;G MADE THE STANDOUT WEBSITE! With this workshop being moved online unexpectedly, I am so surprised with how P&amp;G has brought us all together even in unprecedented times!" - Sofia Ramirez

The global business landscape has changed in remarkable ways with the advent of the Internet. There are more opportunities than ever, but the abundance of media, data and trends can present challenges. It can be impractical and/or costly to maintain an in-house team to respond to the ever-changing digital landscape. If your marketing efforts are lacking, it may be time to lean on outside experts.



Let's look at a few warning signs that you need a digital agency.



You Don't Have the Time



Running a business is a lot of work, and it's easy to spread yourself too thin. In the same way you may hire an accountant to handle the books, handing the marketing reins to a digital agency can free up time for you to focus on the strategy and operation of your business. You do what you best, while they do what they do best. 



You Don't Have the Money



This may seem counterintuitive. But a small budget for marketing indicates that you're not grasping its importance, or that you're not generating enough profit. Working with a digital marketing agency can solve both of these problems. Not to mention, it will likely cost less than hiring someone in-house to manage your marketing campaigns.



You Don't Have the Skills



SEO strategies, social media strategy, paid advertising, web development, content creation -  it takes a long time to master these skills. And we've already discussed that you don't have the time to do it yourself! A digital marketing agency gives you access to an experienced and qualified team who have likely worked on projects just like yours. They'll use their resources and expertise to make sure you're being seen by the right audience, in the right places, at the right times, using dynamic, relevant, innovative strategies. 



You Don't Know What's Working - and What Isn't



If you're not prioritizing marketing, it's unlikely you know how well it's working. ROI (return on investment) is the name of the game in marketing - do you know yours? Digital agencies rely on data and analytics to ensure each of your marketing campaigns are effective. They'll also be able to offer you detailed, tangible metrics how potential and existing customers are engaging with your brand.



Your Don't Update Your Website 



You've heard the old cliches about first impressions, and that definitely applies to your website. An appealing homepage makes the good impression you need, showing site visitors that you're a reputable, established company. From your business standpoint, your website is a critical tool for generating and converting leads. Is your site easy to navigate? Do you lead potential customers down a path to convert them to actual customers? 



If you're not maintaining and updating your website, you're missing many opportunities. A digital agency will have specialists dedicated to optimizing your website, which will also help your SEO (Search Engine Optimization.) An informative, responsive website that provides a good user experience means you'll show up higher in Google's search rankings. Higher rankings = more leads = more sales.



Pixaura Can Help



Marketing your business is integral to success, and there are numerous benefits to bringing in outside help. Look for an agency who can scale their work up or down based on your needs. 



We think we're the experts for you! Hiring an agency may seem like a big commitment - that's why we strive to earn your business each month. Check out some of our clients, and drop us a line when you're ready to get started.

Email marketing isn’t new or sexy. 



But email marketing is effective.



The digital landscape changes rapidly, with new technologies and new mediums meaning you’ve got to stay on your game with your marketing campaigns. But as the saying goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same. And when it comes to communicating with customers, email marketing remains consistent, effective and affordable.







Email marketing is more effective than social media.



You know people who aren’t on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. But do you know anyone who doesn’t have an email address? Probably not, right? In fact, there are over 4 billion email users in the world, sending more than 300 billion emails every day. While social media is a great channel to communicate and interact with your audience, your business is ultimately about generating conversions. According to one study, 81% of respondents said email marketing has driven them to purchase from a new business.



Email reengages your customer base.



In the same study, 80% of those surveyed said that receiving emails from businesses they had purchased from helped make them repeat customers. This is one of the most important aspects of email marketing - you aren't cold calling. You aren't selling your product or services to people who don't know you. You're re-selling, or you're up-selling, to existing customers. And even just a 5% increase in customer retention rate can generate profit increases between 25% and 95%! 



Email marketing is cost-effective.



How much do you spend per email? Nothing? Next to nothing? Email is easy, and it is cheap. Even a slight return on email marketing is worth your time, but studies have repeatedly shown you'll get a lot more than a "slight return." According to Campaign Monitor, you can expect $44 income for each $1 you spend on email campaigns. Can you name another medium that generates that type of ROI?!?



Email reaches people on-the-go.



Today's customer is growing more mobile all the time. Not everyone shops on their phone, but almost everyone checks their email. Reading and sending emails are the most popular mobile activity, even more than texting, web browsing or social media use. Almost half of all emails are opened on a mobile device, and unlike advertisements, email isn't passive. They're action-oriented, directing customers to reply, sign up, or purchase, and more. Even unwanted emails must be deleted, whereas advertisements can simply be ignored.



Email marketing can be customized.



We've all received emails that address us individually, and these emails are 26% more likely to be opened. But email customization can go much further, providing customers with product recommendations, shopping cart reminders and more. These tailored messages show a customer they have unique value to your business. Email marketing can allow you to segment your audience and send messages that provides them something of value. According to one study, 58% of ALL email-generated revenue results from segmented emails!



Conclusion



Email marketing is a versatile and reliable tool that should be a key part of your digital campaigns. Combining email with other marketing tactics allows you to cast a wide net, targeting both existing and potential customers, in an effective AND cost-effective way.

We're passionate about a few things here: digital marketing, our city of Cincinnati, and good food with good friends. Oh, and music. Today is Louis Armstrong Wednesday at Pixaura. It seems fitting to take a minute to honor one of our country's most important black musicians during this important time in America.



His nickname was Satchmo!



Born in 1901 in a city he came to symbolize, Louis was as New Orleans as they come. You simply can't talk about the history of jazz without Louis Armstrong. He played that trumpet in a way that inspired so many, myself included. I never could get my cheeks to blow up quite like him though.







His talent as singer was amplified by his uniquely gravelly voice. He composed, and he acted, he led bands. He even performed as a comedian. Importantly, he was one of the first African-Americans to enjoy success with fan bases of all races. That this happened in such a racially divided era is tribute to his talent and America's appreciation for him.



Acting



He landed roles in movies like High Society, with fellow legends Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Grace Kelly. He earned three Oscar nominations, winning one in 1964 for Hello Dolly, where he starred alongside Barbra Streisand.



It's tough to pick a signature song. Many would say "What a Wonderful World." But I'm quite partial to "La Vie En Rose." I'm feeling generous. Let's go with both.

# Should I Boost a Facebook Post or Run an Ad?

You absolutely must have a Facebook page for your business or brand in today's digital world. But Facebook offers a world of opportunity beyond just sharing updates with your fans. Facebook advertising offers the ability to reach an incredible amount of people, and the ROI is terrific. But there are multiple ways to advertise - you can "boost a Facebook post," or run a traditional ad. Which is better?



Boosted Posts



Boosted posts are exactly what they sound like. Facebook takes your regular post, and increases its reach to a wider audience. Like ads, this will cost you money, but boosting a post offer one main benefit ads do not: you already know your audience likes it!



Most brands choose to boost a Facebook post that has performed well. Imagine your typical post receives 50 "likes" and comments. But your latest update received 200, and some of your users "shared" the post on their own page. This high-performing post is a prime target for a boost!



Ads



We've discussed the value of Facebook advertising a few times. It's a virtual treasure trove for businesses today. But how does it compare to boosted posts?



Behind the scenes is where you'll see the biggest difference. Facebook's provides incredibly detailed analytics for your ads. You can also hone in on your target audience better with an advertisement than with a boosted post. 



Facebook ads also offer more and richer formats - you can run carousel ads, or target highly specific goals. Are you looking for leads? Do you want users to make a purchase or visit your site? Facebook ads include a "call-to-action" button, something you won't find with boosted posts.



Your Strategy



We need information about you before we can answer what's best for your business. As always, your strategy depends on your goals! Are you after brand awareness? A boosted post might be the answer. Or maybe you are looking for customers and conversions - you'll be better off leveraging custom audiences with an ad.



At Pixaura, we believe a combination of both ads and boosted posts is ideal for most brands. Your goals drive your strategy, and you'll find ads may be best for some campaigns, and boosted posts for others. If you're new to the world of Facebook advertising, Pixaura can help - we've been in the game for a while now. We'll align your social media strategy with your total budget, leveraging Facebook's targeting options and reaching more people - all to boost your bottom line.

# 8 Reasons to Update Your Website

In today's world, the face of your business is online. We're outlining several reasons it's critical to update your website and keep your content fresh and relevant.



1. First Impressions.



First impressions are everything.&nbsp;Your website can often serve as your customers’ first impression of your business. In fact, 75% of consumers admit to making judgments on a company’s credibility based on the company’s website design.&nbsp; Whoa.&nbsp; Is your site visually appealing to your customers? Did you design it with your users in mind? There are design elements that increase your website conversions and provide the best user experience (UX) possible. Use them!



2. Quick Decisions.



Not only is design important, but the speed at which your page loads can also impact customers’ opinions about your site and your business.&nbsp;Users take about 0.05 seconds to form their opinion about a website after it loads.&nbsp;We recognized the first impression factor already, but here we want to emphasize the speed at which they make this decision.&nbsp;It has been found that 53% of mobile users will leave a website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load.&nbsp;Users leaving your site will result in a high bounce rate (and lower Google ranking.) We outline ways to increase the load speed of your website (enhancing UX.)&nbsp;



3. CTA - Call To Actions.



First impressions combined with quick decisions require an effective CTA (Call To Action). Think of this as the ‘main purpose’ of your site. What actions do you want your customers to take?&nbsp;Do you want to get a phone call or an email? Are you trying to sell a product or service? This CTA should be front and center, and with a solid first impression and great user experience, your website will support your business.



4. Job Seekers.



Job seekers also form opinions of your company based on your website.  59% of candidates visit the company website after discovering a job opportunity. Generating prospective employees is a tough task. It’s important to showcase your company in the right light to the right candidates. 



5. Simplified Content.



Your website answers the "5W’s" (who, what when, where, why) and more. 55% of readers spend less than 15 seconds on a page. Readers can take in only so much information at a time, so it’s important to provide these answers in a digestible way.&nbsp;Making complex things simple is actually very difficult.&nbsp;Pixaura’s team of marketers expertly help with this task, leaving you with a user friendly, impressively designed website.



6. Search Engine Optimization - SEO.



Google will find your website if it is published.&nbsp;Search Engine Optimization (SEO) helps Google distinguish who would want to find your site upon searching, and then shows it to them.&nbsp;This is incredibly important because 93% of online experiences start with a search engine. SEO is more than just keyword tracking.&nbsp;Websites are constructed like buildings. They need a solid architecture, with things like title tags, meta descriptions and even Local SEO, which helps Google find local businesses upon searches. We offer a Free SEO audit of an existing website to examine your current SEO efforts.



7. Analytics &amp; CRO - Conversion Rate Optimization.



Building a website and monitoring its performance can provide insights that may impact your marketing (and even your entire business's) decisions.&nbsp;A website built with analytics enabled is critical for measurement.&nbsp;After you have visitors/leads to your site, are you converting them into sales? Or are the people bouncing (yes, this is a real term to indicate someone visited your site and left immediately)? Our team uses Google Analytics' landing page data to increase conversion rate optimization.&nbsp;



8. Security, Analysis, and Adjustments.



Security updates should be a regular practice for website owners and hosts.&nbsp;Prevent hacking or blacklisting by working with a reputable company that cares about the security of your website. After your site is built and is secure, it’s crucial to analyze the data and make decisions about the effectiveness of your design and content. Are the viewers dropping off at certain points along the web journey? This is a very important (and fun) part of monitoring new and existing websites.







How We Fit In



At Pixaura, we think of ourselves as an extension of your marketing team, with developers and marketers all working together to help your business thrive online.&nbsp;For more information or to discuss an update to your website design or digital marketing campaigns, drop us a line. We’d love to hear from you!

# Wye Oak Wednesday

It's Wye Oak Wednesday here at Pixaura. Well, here in my home office, I should say. The team's all spread out these days! Excuse me for sounding like a teenager, but this is my favorite band. No joke, I'm sitting here wearing a Wye Oak shirt, writing in a Wye Oak notebook.



I found Wye Oak's video for their song "Fish" in 2011, and instantly fell in love with their music. Although they have grown and transcended genre over the years, their sound remains uniquely identifiable. Side note: they chose their name in reference to the former official tree of their home state, Maryland.



They're even better live! 



I've been fortunate enough to see them twice at Louisville's Zanzibar, and on two other occasions at the Southgate House Revival, just outside Cincinnati. If their tour comes near me, you can trust I'll be there! 



Check out some of their essential hits with this Spotify playlist.




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBOU0dafnlA
Wye Oak - "Fish"



Solo Work



Both of Wye Oak's members, Jenn Wasner and Andy Stack, have been involved in other projects. Jenn's solo project is known as Flock of Dimes; Stack's individual work is under the name Joyero. Additionally, Wasner collaborated as part of Dungeonesse.



Who's Next?

A solid strategy for moving your company higher in search results is by improving your SEO score and site speed.



In terms of ranking, Google will use Lighthouse.



In terms of UX, Google Analytics should be considered.



They both play an important role in ranking in different ways and are influenced by different factors. I would say that UX is the greater factor between the two, as Google focuses on providing the greatest user experience per query.



Lighthouse is also easier to manipulate as all of the pings come out of a single server and predictable location. As a result, this makes it far easier to optimize. UX is a globally encompassing aspect, as users can access your site from on-page links, SERP's, videos, and direct URL searches. Therefore, the traffic acquisition within UX is far broader, and more difficult to manipulate, producing a far more reflective load time.



Having a poor UX load time will also be far more impactful for ranking than a poor Lighthouse load time, as it will increase your domain's bounce rate.



5 ways to Improve your SEO Score



Publish quality content that is relevant Publish quality content on a regular basisGive attention to the metadata on your page, i.e., headings, descriptions, keywordsUse descriptive links on your page, and ensure you are linking to both internal and external pagesDescribe your visual and video media with alt tags to ensure search engines can find them



Improving your SEO score is a long game, but it's worth the effort. Being found by searchers is the goal, and SEO is the method. Need help getting started? Pixaura's experts will build your customized SEO strategy. 



Get our Free SEO Audit report and get an idea where your site stands for page speed and website SEO.



5 Ways to Improve your Site Speed

Over-The-Rhine Neighborhood



Fun fact - they share their name with the area of Cincinnati where you can find our office! This booming neighborhood is home to many of Cincinnati's best restaurants, bars, agencies, and retail. We love being here! (Although we've probably added a few pounds from all this great food.)

# 6 Reasons Your Business Needs Instagram

If I told you there was a platform with over a billion users, would you be interested? I'm really hoping you said yes. The Instagram platform trails only Facebook for number of users, presenting an enormous opportunity for your business. Let's take a look at 6 reasons your business needs Instagram.



Instagram Users are Very Active



This social media network isn't populated with individuals who sign up but then rarely log in. A recent study found that 38% of IG's users check the app multiple times EACH DAY. User engagement is 10x higher than Facebook, in large part a result of the organic nature of Instagram. Generally, you don't have to hunt for followers. If you post quality content, they will find you. And as more users follow you, you'll be suggested to more users. Followers beget followers, basically. Unlike Facebook, Instagram users follow businesses all the time - 80% of users willingly connected to a brand in 2017.



The Demographics of Instagram



Almost half the U.S. population is on Instagram. Clearly, that is too large a market segment to ignore. Of these 120+ million users, 64% are between the ages of 18-34, with another 25% between the ages of 35-54. These age ranges comprise the active consumer segment of the U.S. economy. Be visible to them!



Selling on Instagram



While Instagram is notoriously a visual platform, there are opportunities for businesses to make money. 72% of Instagram users have purchased products through Instagram. This presents a huge opportunity for businesses of any size. Brands can tag items for sale in their posts, and link to their store. Also, there's a well-developed ability to run advertisements in multiple formats and with advanced targeting options. In addition, the ad manager offers detailed tracking reports so you can effectively gauge your ROI.



Tell Your Brand's Story



Instagram gives businesses the opportunity to create a themed feed. Think of your Instagram page as a home page - it's important for the pictures to fit together. The look of this overall feed outweighs the aesthetics of any one image. Regardless of your industry, there is something unique about your brand - showcase that! You could be a florist or a plumber, and there will still be a way to beautify what you do and communicate your message. Show off your personality or your culture. Highlight new products, your team, your events - the opportunities are endless.



Tag, You're It



Hashtags are like keywords, and they serve to increase your brand's visibility. They make you searchable and findable, get you noticed, earn you followers, and increase clicks to your site. Developing a branded hashtag is a big bonus; creating an actionable one is even better. Also, Instagram provides the option for location tagging, allowing users to post photos related to your place of business. That's free advertising!



User Engagement



The Instagram platform helps you effectively engage with customers. In addition to providing visual content, Instagram makes it easy to respond to questions or comments. This humanizes your business, leading to trust and a better customer experience. Stories make your business relatable; behind-the-scenes shots, employee highlights, and live Q&amp;A's are a great way to connect with your followers.



Pixaura 



Finally, stay cognizant of why users are there. People don’t go on Instagram to read or see advertisements. People go on IG to see pretty pictures, to connect, to engage. And in today's marketplace, it's important to give your customers an engaging experience across multiple platforms. Your business needs Instagram! If you need help developing your social media strategy, Pixaura can help.

DEVELOPING AN INTERIM STRATEGY



This is a difficult time for everyone, and for you, a difficult decision: marketing during a crisis. How should you do it? Should you at all?



All that time you spent on your marketing strategy - well, it’s useless now.&nbsp;Was that too harsh? Okay, I'm sorry. It won’t be useful for a while. Better?



It’s time to pivot, and quickly. This pandemic has changed everything, and your marketing needs to change with it.&nbsp;



Strategy: Where To Start



Begin by determining what your business goals are today and how they have changed. If you had to adjust your business model to the current climate, you need to update your audience. If you’re offering the same services, it’s a good idea to announce that as well. More than ever, your marketing content needs to be reflective of where your business is.&nbsp;



Marketing Content: Timely Or Timeless?



Next, determine how much you want to “lean in” to what’s happening. Time-sensitive marketing has real value - relevant content can bring you into conversations that are already occurring. On the other hand, content that is timeless will bring you traffic now AND down the road. At Pixaura, we recommend you use both types of content.



(Side note: the COVID crisis prompted this post. It will not be the only event that necessitates analyzing and adjusting your marketing strategy. Bad news will continue to come, and it’s important to remember that even if your business wasn’t directly affected, your audience almost certainly was.)



Your Audience: Find Them



Speaking of your audience, who are they? Where are they? People are online more than ever, but they are behaving in different ways. You may even discover brand new eyes on your content - what led them to you now? As always, it’s necessary to adjust your marketing strategy in order to reach your target audience.



Finally, determine what you want actions you want this audience to take. Is your marketing now informational, or still conversion-driven? Set short-term goals that are realistic and measurable, and ensure your content is congruent.



Be Visible: Don’t Disappear



Regardless of the changes to your strategy, keep marketing! Studies have shown that “going dark,” even during a crisis, results in a significant decline in brand awareness. Keep interacting, keep pushing out new content, keep building your reputation. Be authentic and empathetic while maintaining your brand’s tone and perspective. 



How PIXAURA Can Help



We've spent years in the digital marketing field, and can help you with developing your strategy, both in times of normalcy and times of crisis. We use SEO, Google Ads, social media and website design to build your brand exposure and score you more leads, sales, and traffic. Reach out to us today if your business needs assistance navigating their marketing during a crisis - or anytime else!

# The CARES Act: What You Need to Know

Our nation’s lawmakers have agreed and passed a $2 trillion stimulus bill called the CARES Act. The legislation provides relief to American citizens and businesses who have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s what you need to know.



For Individuals



Direct Payments



Firstly, the Act stipulates that all Americans will receive a one-time rebate of up to $1200 ($2400 for married couples.) Additionally, parents will receive an additional payment of $500 per child. However, the rebate will be reduced for individuals making between $75,000 and $100,000 ($150,000 and $200,000 if married.)  No checks will be issued to those with incomes above these thresholds.&nbsp;



Unemployment



The CARES Act provides $250 billion for an extended unemployment insurance program. The act dramatically expands eligibility, and the program will pay individuals $600/week for 4 months on top of state program payments. Even more, the act extends state benefits from 26 to 39 weeks. Additionally, the act makes eligible the self-employed, gig economy workers, and contractors for this benefit.



Retirement Funds



The CARES Act waives the 10% penalty on early withdrawals. However, the amount withdrawn is still subject to tax, but that tax burden can be spread across three years. Optionally, citizens may repay the amount withdrawn over the same three years, allowing for contributions in excess of the typical annual limits. Additionally, 401k participants may take loans up to $100,000. Previously, the limit was $50,000.



COVID Testing/Treatment



The Act covers the costs of testing for COVID-19, as well as any potential vaccine or treatment developed.



Student Loans



The act allows for the suspension of payments, interest, and garnishment on federal student loans through September 30, 2020.



For Businesses



Small Businesses



The Act dedicates $350 billion to small businesses (under 500 employees) to prevent layoffs and closures. However, the portion of a company’s loan used for payroll, interest, mortgage, rent, and utilities can be forgiven if employee payroll is maintained. This is the Paycheck Protection Program.




Paycheck Protection Program




Large Corporations



The CARES Act earmarks a $500 billion stimulus to large corporations. Unlike the small business program, businesses must pay these loans back within 5 years - they cannot be forgiven.



Corporate Tax&nbsp;



Businesses can choose to delay their quarterly tax payments until October 15, 2020.



Payroll Tax Relief



Businesses can delay the employer half of the payroll tax for 2020. Instead, companies can spread these payments across 2021 and 2022.







At a time of great difficulty, it is refreshing to see our lawmakers put away their differences and come together to create legislation designed to see us through this crisis!

# Don't Stop Advertising! Now More than Ever.

In these uncertain times, it can be challenging to know how to market effectively. &nbsp;This is a scary time for many businesses, and there are important decisions to be made. You need revenue, but if you stop digital marketing, it’s hard to make sales. If you continue advertising, how do you ensure your message is received favorably by customers who are likely worried about their own situations?



For many, the inclination is to stop, sit back and see what happens. But don't stop advertising! Marketing is a long game. Customers are more likely to make a purchase the more times they're exposed to your brand or product. You’ve spent a lot of time building your brand and reputation. You’ve determined your target audience and formulated a strategy. Don’t throw away that time and effort. More people are online than ever - make sure you’re seen.



Facebook Advertising



In today's climate, Facebook is beyond important - it's necessary. Facebook ads allow us to target audiences in incredibly precise fashion. Right now, many of your competitors are cutting back on advertising. To boot, the costs are dropping, and simultaneously, more eyes are on your ads. For brands that maintain or grow their ad spending, that’s marketing nirvana. The ads you run now could have a better ROI and stronger impact than you’ve experienced before.



But where should you begin? Let’s start with the important stuff: if your current ads are working, don’t stop them! But if they’re tone deaf, or a bit insensitive for a crisis, pull them and get back to the drawing board. This situation is NOT a gimmicky marketing opportunity. If you want to run a sale, go ahead - but don’t link it to this pandemic. If your coupon code is “covid-19”, go ahead and prepare for the backlash of offended customers (who will likely never come back.)



Instead, focus on how you can be of service. If your product solves a problem, great! Tell people how it can help them. Maybe offer flexible payment options or amend your typical contract language. People need to know you’re after more than just their money. If you can be sensitive to what others are experiencing, and find opportunities to cooperate and collaborate, you’ll go beyond building a customer - you’ll build a community.&nbsp;

As of last week, Google business reviews are no longer being published to business accounts. This came largely in response to ill-informed or malicious reviews about businesses not being open during their typical hours. In other cases, users were fraudulently claiming that someone had contracted COVID-19 at an establishment. 



Rest assured, Google's short-staffed teams are still hard at work. New listings, claims, and verifications for health-related businesses have been deemed top priority. You can expect delays for these types of updates for other businesses.



However, profile edits are still a priority. Whether you're open, offering special hours or experiencing a temporary closure, Google employees will be manually reviewing and updating these types of changes as soon as possible. So be sure to keep your business profile up to date if anything has changed during COVID.



In the meantime, Google posts are still functioning - use them to communicate with your customers! And don't worry, reviews that post during this time will be published when things get back to normal. If you need help building your reputation, Pixaura is here to help with that.

# Don't Just Advertise - Engage With Customers!
> Let’s face it: people don’t like ads.  We’re bombarded with them every day in every place.  We’ve learned to look past them, ignore them, or at best, skim their content. But there's a better way. Don't just advertise to your customers&hellip;

Let’s face it: people don’t like ads.  We’re bombarded with them every day in every place.  We’ve learned to look past them, ignore them, or at best, skim their content. But there's a better way. Don't just advertise to your customers - engage with them!



It isn’t all bad news.  Customer feedback about what they don’t like tells us a lot about what they do want.  And what they want is for you to engage with them.  Don't just advertise - here are 3 ways to connect with your customers.



Reshare



Some of the best content will come from your fans.&nbsp; If someone is praising you, share it!&nbsp; If someone is using your product or service, feature it!&nbsp; Few campaigns are more effective than voice-of-customer data.&nbsp; Before sharing, remember to ask permission and give them credit.&nbsp; 



Bonus: resharing your fans’ content might just lead to more user content to share.&nbsp; Not a bad cycle to find yourself in!



Respond



Customers want to be heard, whether about a product suggestion or their experience with your business.&nbsp; Show them there’s real people behind your account by answering them, especially through social media.



Don’t respond to just the good reviews; learn to see the negatives as opportunities for excellent customer service!&nbsp; Consumers pay attention to how you handle bad reviews, and according to Forbes, 45% of people will still visit businesses with negative reviews when they are answered in a concerned and helpful fashion.



Reward



Loyalty perks exist because they work. Today, many business are rewarding their fans through social media contests.&nbsp; When these giveaways involve sharing your content, you’re leveraging your existing customer community and boosting brand awareness beyond your own audience.&nbsp; This, in turn, can gain you additional viewers for your future campaigns.&nbsp; 



Just remember to make sure your rewards are relevant - a golf course giveaway should be golf-related, right?




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW-rJ7RDdlM




Advertising



But what about ads? Well the title of this article is "don't JUST advertise" after all.  Ads still and will always matter, and the old rules still apply - know your audience, tell them how you can help them, and be honest about the benefits you’re offering. Finally, make sure you’re sending them to a dedicated post-click landing page. Don't waste effort enticing them without linking to exactly where you can convert the click to a sale!

# You Started a Business. Congratulations!

You Brought Your Dream to Life. Now What?



You had an idea and you made it happen. You started a business! It took a lot to get here. But to paraphrase Robert Frost, you’ve got miles to go before you’ll get a full night’s sleep again. Or something like that. Truth is, you’ll work late often, and turn around to be greeted by an early morning too. You’ll be challenged, and you’ll be rewarded. You’ll have ups, and you’ll have downs.



We’re rooting for more ups than downs. To make that happen, you need customers. To get customers, you need to build awareness of your brand, and in today’s business climate, that will be most successful when approached digitally.



Digital marketing strategies are NOT a one-size-fits-all scenario. Your company’s customized plan will be affected by your goals, product, industry, target audience and more. However, there are certain commonalities every business will need to account for in developing their digital campaigns.



Target Acquired&nbsp;



You can’t market effectively if you don’t know which customers you want. Users won’t organically find you very often - you’ve got to go to them, and that requires knowing who they are and where they spend their time. Identifying your customers and developing a strategy all starts with data. Don’t try to reach everyone; market to your target audience instead of landing your message with irrelevant groups unlikely to respond.



Your Presence is Requested



You need a website. (Stating the obvious.) A well-designed site improves your visibility, but needs to do more than just be informative. A multi-functional site gives users the brand interaction they’re after, while generating more leads and more sales.



Put Yourself Out There 



Social media is more important and complex than ever. Effective social marketing increases your exposure, generates traffic, and develops loyal customers. Potential customers are using many social platforms, so meet them head-on with a comprehensive strategy that engages them across various media.



Don't Get Lost in the Crowd



Search Engine Optimization is a must for your business. A professional audit will elevate your company when users search keywords related to your industry. This not only increases traffic, but gives the impression that you are an established company with a good reputation. Paid search marketing is a cost-effective strategy with an historically healthy ROI.



Building your customer base is an uphill climb, but a consistent digital marketing strategy can help increase your visibility. When starting a business, the right tactics will help you stand out from the crowd. Get out there and tell the world what you have to offer. &nbsp;



Not sure how to start? Pixaura can help.

# Hire Professional Website Designers. Skip the DIY.

Why Is No One Coming to my Website?
You went with the template over the professionally designed website. You’ve created your mind-blowing website. It’s beautiful. It’s telling your brand’s story perfectly. You did it for free on Squarespace. No one is coming.
When it comes to websites, free isn’t always better. In fact, it's never better.
Your website may be head-turning in the looks department, but if no one sees it then does it even matter? Here are a few things professional website designers can help with that free website hosting sites lack.
Four Reasons to Use a Professional Website Developer
Schemas
Google crawls websites to see what they’re all about and give users the most relevant results. Schema explains, in code, to Google what each section of your site is about. By providing explicit clues in the coding, you make this easy for Google -- upping your chances of being ranked higher in the search results. The right pro is knowledgeable in structured data guidelines, knowing what is required and/or recommended for structured data and Google. Wix isn’t going to have your back on this.
Responsive design
This means that your web pages look fabulous on whatever device the consumer is using. Whether it's a laptop, tablet, or phone, it needs to be functional on all of them. Otherwise, the user will almost automatically head to your competitor’s site. Professional website design makes sure that isn’t happening, and that your website provide a high quality user experience (UX.)
Code
Your code needs to be written the right way for search engines to collect the data they need quickly and easily. This is important for ranking higher on the results pages. Only a website developer will have full control over this, giving your website and business the best shot at landing on the top SERPs (search engine result pages). 
Cool stuff you can’t do on your own
Don’t be limited by a mass-produced template. By building a website with functionality tailored for your business, a website developer helps with usability, ease of navigation, and just cool extras you can’t do any other way. If users are able to navigate your e-commerce website or online store easily, they are more likely to purchase your product or services. Also, a professional can create whatever you want for your website. But the code is the limit when it comes to features. With a professional, you won’t be hindered by your template. 
Free always seems like a good idea until taking a closer look. You’re spending time, money, blood, sweat and tears on your business, don’t skimp when it comes to your website and use a free host. There’s a reason it’s free.

# Ignoring Online Reviews? You’re Doing it Wrong

97% of Customers Read Online Reviews
When was the last time you bought something without reading a review? Restaurant or roofer, dentist or car, potential customers are not purchasing without checking reviews first. And why would they? With an array of choices at their fingertips, they’re not just picking the first name in the phone book anymore. Everyone can get personal recommendations in a matter of seconds. If you’re ignoring online reviews, you are risking catastrophic damage to your business. You’ve spent time, money, sweat, and tears growing your brand, don’t drop the ball with online reviews.
Let’s look at the numbers
97% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses, and a staggering 97% of those people read the business's response to the reviews. Did you get that? 97%! It’s pretty clear that people who care about reviews also care if the business is actively responding to them. 
You’ve got them. Don’t lose them.
It’s loads easier to retain a customer than to gain a new one. Think about the time, effort, and money it takes to get someone to hear about your business. To not only know who you are but actually convince them to check you out and spend their hard-earned dollars on you over the thousands of other choices. There’s a reason marketing is a business - it’s hard work! If they had a negative experience and you ignore them, you most likely will not only lose them as a customer, but risk their bad experience spreading to more and more people. When the 82% of consumers who are reading online reviews comes across that ignored bad review, chances are you’ll lose them too. You’ve come this far. Don’t lose them over a review.
You’ve convinced me. Now what?
Be an active participant. Pay attention to and monitor your online reviews on as many sites as you can. Respond to every single review you can find, positive or negative. Thank a loyal customer for their positive review and you’ve locked someone in for life. Respond to a negative review to let the person know you care, and everyone sees you're an invested business owner. It’s not rocket science. You can do it. If you don't have the time, we can do it for you.

# Your Marketing Campaign? People Hate It.

What Not to Do In Your Next Marketing Campaign
It’s not you. Oh wait, it definitely is. Think you know what you’re doing when it comes to your do-it-yourself marketing campaign? You’re probably doing it wrong. Consumers think that they hate marketing, when what they really hate are your annoying strategies. Attract consumers with what works and stay away from these common blunders.
1. Targeting Everyone
There’s nothing more annoying than a company continuously popping up on a screen over and over, especially when what they're selling isn’t relevant to the consumer. As a company, you’re turning off potential future customers by annoying them when they don’t need you. If you do this, chances are when they do need you, they’ll likely go somewhere else. You’re also wasting your resources. Keep track of that ROI (return on investment) and target where it works.
2. Avoiding Social Media
You may not be getting a ton of leads from Facebook but that doesn’t mean you can slack. When a user wants to find you, they need to be able to find you. Whether on Google, Instagram or Facebook, there is nothing more frustrating to a consumer than putting in the effort to look you up and you’re nowhere to be found. You don’t have to be investing a ton of resources but be present and active on as many platforms as you can. If a consumer can’t find you, they will move on to someone they can.
3. Not Responding to Comments
You may think you’re off the hook after putting out your killer social and blog posts, but you’ve still got things to do. Consumers want to interact with brands. When they are interacting with your posts, they expect a response. It’s great to have fans and when a brand is taking the time and responding to a consumer individually they get so pumped and chances are you’ll have a loyal customer for a long time. If you’re not reviewing and responding, consumers get offended and may take a break from your brand or move on all together.
4. Spamming Your Customers
Stop reaching out to consumers unless you’ve actually got something to say. Quality over quantity folks or you will be promptly snoozed/hidden/unfollowed. Make sure what you’re putting out there is worthy of your consumer’s time. Make it relevant, entertaining and helpful. If it’s not meeting these criteria, then skip it. You don’t need a post everyday if it’s pointless.
5. Not Using a Call to Action
Sometimes you have to spell it out. Want your consumer to be taking advantage of a sale? Contacting you for your services? Spell it out and make it easy on them. Post links, create imaging that visually communicates what you’re pushing. Do as much of the work FOR them as you can. In that spirit, make sure you’re following these tips or if you want us to do the work for you, contact us here.  ;)

pix·ie dust noun



a substance or influence with an apparently magical effect that brings great success or luck. For example, "the folks who live there still seem to believe that they've been sprinkled with pixie dust."



At Pixaura, we like to think we have the magic dust to sprinkle on your brand and bring success. For your enjoyment, here is some fun information. 



“All it takes is faith and trust... Oh! And something I forgot: Dust. Just a little bit of pixie dust.”―Peter Pan











How Do You Use It? 



Pixie Dust&nbsp;is a crafting material dropped by Pixies. It creates Greater Healing Potions and Holy Water, the latter of which spreads The Hallow and other Hallow-related objects. It produces a glow and light when Pixies drop this item or if it is thrown on the ground. -Fandom



What Color is Pixie Dust?



In its common appearance,&nbsp;it&nbsp;is nothing more than a golden, sparkling powder. Usually, this&nbsp;dust&nbsp;comes from special blue&nbsp;dust&nbsp;which replenishes the supply. As a golden&nbsp;color, it enables pixies to fly. "Happy thoughts" are worthless without it! Nevertheless, we're going to keep thinking positive! -Disney Fandom

You Can’t Run a Successful Business Without These Four Digital Marketing Tactics
Companies without digital strategies are often drifting, aimlessly through the search engine world, consistently shoved out of the way and trampled by focused brands who are utilizing every strategy within their reach. Don’t be that company! There are tools out there just waiting to be harnessed to amplify your company. If you are a business there is no excuse to not be using them:
1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Search engines WANT to be able to find you. Throw them a bone! If you’re a perfect match for a consumer Google wants them to find you. If they can’t find you, you’re missing that connection and that person’s business. 
SEO is the process of gaining free, organic website traffic. Free being the key word! But anything that is free means competition. You’re going to have to work for this. Search engine algorithms are determining who is showing up first. And let’s face it, no one is browsing past the first page, so do everything you can to snag those coveted spots. Search engines will never give away their algorithm secrets but there are some across the board things you can be doing to up your chances of showing up. 
Creating quality content that is purposeful and relevant. Using great keywords when appropriate. Updating content regularly. Building an easily crawlable website. Quick site loading time. Creating meaningful URLs. Linking to trusted authorities. Making sure your site is being shared by social channels. Writing gripping meta descriptions. Giving users a secure connection. 
This stuff is free. You can do it. You should be doing it.
2. Content Marketing
It’s not all about you. Consumers are wanting to follow and purchase from companies that they feel a connection with. It’s not all about what you do, your products, your history (well, a little bit). Becoming an industry expert and promoting important industry content is how you snag those long-term customers. When brainstorming blogs and social posts sprinkle in industry news and topics. Consumers will keep coming back for the info they’re interested in, creating a relationship with your brand and leading to long-term customers.
3. Pay-Per-Click Marketing (PPC)
PPC basically means that you pay a small fee for every click from a consumer. The most popular PPC tool is Google Ads (formerly Google Adwords). If you create an awesome campaign, you appear above the organic search results. Is your mouth watering over this prime position? It should be. Don’t be fooled into thinking you can throw some money at this and start appearing first in searches. A lot goes into creating successful PPC campaigns, so invest your time and resources. Selecting the right keywords, organizing campaigns and ad groups and setting up successful landing pages are all a must. Once everything is working together smoothly, expect to see results.
4. Review Management
It’s been proven most shoppers check out online reviews before making a purchase. Think you can just bury your head in the sand and ignore this part of owning a successful company? Nope. People will be out there reviewing your business left and right and you need to be engaged. The negative reviewers expect a response, the positive reviewers expect to be acknowledged and those who are browsing expect to see an engaged business that is responding to reviews. Often times only those who have a negative experience will leave reviews. Encourage a more balanced view by reaching out to satisfied past clients and customers. You can do your best to respond to reviews by making sure that you’re monitoring the most important sites and channels in your industry or you can outsource and hire a company to do it all for you.
It’s time to get into the game and start competing with the big boys. If you’re not utilizing these digital strategies you’re not doing your best work.

The Right To Be Forgotten. What is it and What Does it Mean for Your Business?
Don’t pretend you haven’t done it. We all Google ourselves, but what if your results keep turning up something you don’t want everyone to know? Future employers seeing debt you used to owe or embarrassing affiliations from when you were a minor. Do you have the right to be forgotten? How do you combat negative press when the right to be forgotten hasn’t made it to the U.S.? What does this mean for businesses?
Background
In 2014 the European Court of Justice (similar to our supreme court), ruled that the right to be forgotten is a human right, when Mario Costeja González sought to remove search results mentioning his own personal debt. At this point the European Union and Argentina are the only ones that have legally put the right to be forgotten into practice. If there is potentially damaging information about an individual online, individuals have the right to request that search engines remove those URLs from their database. Here in the United States, where freedom of speech reigns supreme, we are far from having this policy implemented. 
The Good. The Bad.
At first glance you may be thinking, hell yeah! Now I can’t rid the internet of my embarrassing first profile pics and Twitter rants about past jobs I hated. Upon closer inspection this ability would allow people to rewrite history and limit public access to knowledge. While the right to be forgotten would go a long way to protect people from being associated with things like crimes they were never convicted of or an angry ex’s attempt to damage a reputation, proceeding carefully is a must to protect access to information.
What Does This Mean for Businesses?
The right to be forgotten shows us how powerful an online reputation is when nations are ruling that negative results should be removed from search engines. As a business owner you come across negative results about your business all the time. It’s just a part of the game. People love ranting online. We all wish we could take those negative online reviews and make them disappear. While this is a pipe dream, there are things you can do to combat these negative results.
What To Do
Make sure you are responding to every review about your business, both positive and negative. It’s easy to get frustrated and ignore a negative review, or take positive reviews for granted, but responding to reviews is showing that you are an engaged and caring business. You are able to hopefully solve a problem with a response to a negative review and leave a positive reviewer with a warm and fuzzy feeling after shooting them a thank you.
Seek out reviews. Online reviews can be one sided. People will leave reviews only when they have a negative experience, and simply leave happy without alerting the internet (gasp) when they have an awesome experience. Seeking out positive reviews means giving potential customers a more realistic view of your business. 
Brag about yourself. Take those positive reviews and amplify them. Using positive reviews in website copy, social posts and blog posts means that you are multiplying their positive effect when it comes to your online reputation.
If there is one thing we can learn from the right to be forgotten it is that online reputation is important. Don’t let your business suffer from negative reviews. We can help.

Our first music tribute was Stevie Wonder Wednesday. And we're following up with an American icon, Willie Nelson! 



Born in Texas in 1933, Willie's life started with some foreshadowing of the eccentric stories to come. Born close to midnight, his birth certificate lists April 29th. But no one knows if it was actually April 30th yet! His grandparents, both of whom studied with the Chicago Music Institute, raised Willie, helping spur the young boy's interest in music. 



He wrote his first song at age 7, and performed with Bob Wills, the inventor of western swing, at just 13 years old. Before his music career began in earnest, he worked as a cotton picker, DJ, bible salesman and saddle maker, amongst other odd jobs and short stint in the Air Force.



Nelson was one of the central figures in the rise of "outlaw country." This subgenre, largely a response to the conservative Nashville studios, erupted as the careers of artists like Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, and Merle Haggard took off.We're sure you've got work to do today. Meanwhile, enjoy some classics on this playlist on Spotify. Or if you've got the time, check out this wild list of Willie Nelson facts. Some of these are hard to believe, and some fit perfectly with his legendary outlaw persona.

Major Players Invest in Digital Marketing
We still come across many a client who is dragging their feet when it comes to digital marketing. If we can’t convince you, maybe Éstee Lauder can.
One of the largest beauty companies in the world, Éstee Lauder, knows where to invest to continue reporting profits year after year. “These investments are mainly now in digital. Seventy-five percent of our investment now are in digital social media influencers, and they’re revealing to be highly productive,” CEO Fabrizio Freda says. 
Did you hear that? Most of their budget is going to digital! Investing your money where growth is happening, yields returns for your company. You may think that slapping up a website is good enough. It isn’t. As a business owner one of your jobs is to cultivate and nurture your online presence. If you don’t, get ready to wilt behind the businesses that are shining bright online.
Okay, so you’re not Éstee Lauder and you’re not paying millions of dollars to influencers but recognizing where major players are spending time and resources should give your clarity about the importance of digital presence. Work your Google Ads, keep your social media game tight, don’t skimp on blogs, monitor your online reviews, update your website content regularly and reach out to influencers. If you don’t have the time, we will do it for you.

You have burning digital marketing FAQ's. We have expert answers.
 
Can I just do my own SEO (search engine optimization)?
You CAN, but chances are a professional will do a better job. We know all of the ins and outs of the SEO game. It’s what we do. You may have your meta description and content game down but are you optimizing page speed and adding in your H1, H2, etc. content tags? There are so many pieces to the puzzle. We make sure you’re addressing the whole picture so consumers can find your site.
Can I just use a website template?
This is totally an option but let’s look at the pros and cons. Pros: It’s quick. It’s easy. Anyone can do it. Cons: A template may not meet the ideal needs of your specific business. Like, if you sell online you’ll have different needs than a non-profit. It’s not optimized for search engines. Templates are made to be pretty and easy, not necessarily be functioning and updating to give you the best SEO. As your business grows your template website may not be able to handle the needed pages. If you own a successful business your Squarespace site may not last you long. Working with professionals from the beginning means a website that’s working for you now and working for the long game.
Do my online reviews really matter?
YES. Time and time again we see business neglecting this key factor in nurturing their growing business. Search engines are taking online reviews into account, so it’s one more way to fight your way to the top of the SERPs (search engine result pages). Surprised? You shouldn’t be. Google works to give its users the best results and since users love online reviews, of course search engines are showing them some love. Don’t think one bad review can hurt? You’re wrong. 95% of consumers say a bad online review deterred them from using a business. You need to be cultivating good online reviews, making sure you’re showing up on the right review sites and always responding to negative reviews. Don’t let this huge part of your business fall through the cracks.
Why Google Ads?
The ultimate goal of digital marketing is to appear at the top of the SERPs organically. Want a shortcut? Google Ads it. In short Google Ads places you above organic search results. You can tailor and target specific audiences to capitalize on your ideal demographics, all leading to more traffic and sales. Our experts do Google Ads all day long and know how to word and manage your campaigns for success.
What type of content works best?
The answer to this question is tailored for each specific client and includes a mix of strategies. One thing to keep in mind is that super, salesy content tends to turn consumers off. If you’re building long-term, loyal followers focus your content on storytelling. The consumer wants to connect with businesses in a more authentic way than in the past. They want transparency and honesty. Stay away from anything too pushy. Instead, focus on your brand values, use humor when appropriate, share industry news and company culture. Build a relationship not a single sale.

We're happy to announce the arrival of a new website we built for Unveil Systems.
At Pixaura we really dig working with cool companies. Unveil fits this description perfectly! This state of the art company uses mixed reality to train military, EMS and future doctors. For us, it was a privilege to build the website for the amazing work they are doing.
The mixed reality technology uses the Microsoft Hololens to give emergency medical personnel a realistic training experience. Allowing existing training suites to make the most of what they already have, this technology can also be used with a TOMManikin. 
Realistic Training
Mixed reality also allows emergency medical students to experience training that reflects real-world scenarios. For example, they can test a patient's breathing rate, breathing symmetry, pulse, and oxygen levels. Additionally, the technology lets you customize the injuries you’re seeing. This allows the student as many repetitions as needed to get desired results. To put it simply: better training means better results.
The superb technology used in the Unveil system tracks each student’s gaze to see where they are looking. The data is auto-recorded to allow more time to work on the important stuff. Also, this technology makes it possible to jump forward and backward in the patient's progression. It takes just seconds to go from the injury to long term changes. This gives the trainee more information about the decisions they made or should have made. Allowing existing training suites to make the most of what they already have, this technology can also be used with a TOMManikin.
Saving lives is serious business. Unveil upgrades any training system using some of the coolest technology we’ve seen.

A.I., or Artificial Intelligence, is the future of the internet. And we're here to help put your digital aura in the minds of the different A.I. engines/brains online. Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc., are all making decision about ads and content display based on A.I. :) All of these brains and algorithms continue to grow more complex every day. 



Words, sentences, pages, and sites are being interpreted and *read* by A.I. But are they doing it effectively and do they understand your true meaning and intention? Also, is your content reaching the right audience in the right market?

Write Title Tags Like an SEO Pro
When it comes to how to write title tags for SEO (search engine optimization), writing clickable titles makes all of the difference. 
It goes by many names: meta title, meta tag, page title, title tag. It’s all the same thing. Just like the title of a movie or book, this is the first thing that users see. It needs to reach out through all of the Google noise, grab their chin and give it a gentle jerk toward your incredible website. 
What is a Title Tag?
Don’t be freaked out by the resounding importance of optimizing your titles. At its most basic level, it is simply the title of your page. This piece of code tells search engines what your page is all about, so it can give users the best results. When you Google something, this is the blue link that shows up on the SERP (search engine results page).
Why Do They Matter?
Google uses tons of signals to make up its ranking algorithm. Your title tag is one of the most important factors. Simply put, a great title tag will get you closer to the top of the SERP and give you a prime spot in coveted results real estate. 
Ok, you’ve made it to the first results page on Google. Now that user has a whole page of websites to choose from. A catchy yet informative title ups your chances of being chosen. Your SEO strategy is not just appearing in search results (only a newbie digital marketer stops there,) but getting as many clicks as you can. This increases the odds of new customers.  
Let’s Write Some Title Tags
Know your keywords.
Keywords are the words a consumer would use when searching for a business like yours. Get into their head. Think like the consumer. Do some Googling, check the results, check the related phrases and browse the results you’re getting. There are tons of tools out there that you can use that claim to have the ability to find you the best keywords and this is an option too. 
Where your keywords go. 
It is of collective opinion that having keywords close to the beginning of the title will get you better results (Google will never tell us exactly how their algorithms work). On the other hand, your title should also flow naturally and have good readability for the user. So don’t go out of your way to create an awkward title just to put a keyword first.
Rein in your length.
It’s tempting to try and throw a bunch of information and keywords into your title but Google will only show a certain number of characters and we’ve moved well past keyword loading and search engines. Ideally, keep your title below 60 characters. 
Mix it up. 
Each of your pages should have their own unique title. Google hates repetition and it’s confusing for the user and the search engine. Mix up your keywords. This gives you a better shot at showing up in multiple, related searches. Add an accurate description of what the page is and you are good to go.
Hook the user. 
The final step is using words that appeal to a user. Add in unique descriptors. Use action words such as learn, discover, try. Make sure that the user can actually do the things you’re describing on that particular page. Nothing frustrates a user more than not being able to find what they’re looking for and they will abandon your website completely, for website navigation that makes sense. 
Now that you understand a little more how titles can affect your click through rates, take a stag at rewriting your title tags, and watch your traffic increase. Your title tag is an important SEO tool. Don’t waste it.

We’ll let you in on a little secret...the key to successful SEO
When it comes to successful SEO, content will always be king. Google may tweak its ranking system regularly but it will always come back to content. If you’re phoning it in or looking for SEO shortcuts, get ready to be invisible to search engines and customers alike. Quality content is always the gold standard.
E-A-T Acronym
Expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. Commit these words to memory. This acronym is key in the SEO world. These three gems continue to pop up as top players when it comes to Google’s ranking system. Want to be at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs)? You want to hit the mark for each of these. Google wants users to feel confident in the results they are receiving when they search. It’s not just about relevancy anymore, it’s about trustworthiness (no fake news!). 
How To Do It
We can go into a ton of detail here but if you want some easy things you can be doing right now to up your E-A-T score, here ya go: including author names and biographies for all content, creating trustworthy content, link only from authoritative websites, easy to find contact info, having a visible privacy policy and investing in technical security, among other things.
Authenticity
You may think that figuring out all of Google’s secrets for ranking websites and playing into their hands is going to shoot your website to the top. This used to be the case back in the day but Google is not the naive search engine it once was. It is a shrewd and grown up search engine and it does not like playing games. Every time Google adjusts its results algorithm it is aiming for one thing, to give users quality results. 
How To Do It
If you focus on cultivating and nurturing your website you ARE playing right into what Google’s hands. No tricks, no games, just giving Google what it wants. Time for a grown up relationship. Work hard to boost your brand and website through great and relevant copy, blogs that have a finger on the pulse of the industry, keywords that make sense and experts that enhance your visitor experience. Stop playing games with Google.
There are a ton of things you can do to up your SEO game. At Pixaura we will execute them all seamlessly for you. If you’re tackling this on your own, this is the best place to start. Forget the tricks. If you’re doing only one thing for your SEO make sure it is giving users quality content that they can trust. You can’t go wrong.

Do Online Reviews Matter?
You’re the master of your industry, you’ve got your brand on lock, you’re killing it in your local market. Then it happens: one bad review rears its ugly head. You're thinking an online review won’t make or break your business, but you’re wrong. Remember how businesses used to thrive through personal recommendation and word of mouth referrals? That’s what online reviews are today and they matter. A lot. 
Why Reviews Are Important
Everyone is reading online reviews before making their purchasing decisions. 9 out of 10 consumers read customer reviews before purchasing, and 7 out of 10 consumers are more likely to consider a business with positive reviews. Also, 90% of people claimed positive online reviews influence buying decisions, while 86 percent were influenced by negative reviews. If you don’t have a handle on your online reputation you’re not going to make it.
Check out how Pixaura can help your reviews
Reviews Impact Your SEO
Search engines love reviews because consumers love reviews. So it makes sense that online reviews are playing a major role in your SEO (search engine optimization). It is thought that online reviews are making up 10% of the factors considered by search engines for search result pages. Having reviews increases your website’s likelihood of showing up when people search for your industry.
How to Get More Reviews
Now that you know how important online reviews are, it's time to start working to acquire these positive reviews. Making opportunities available to your customers that are easy, clear and take just moments of their time is a good place to start. However, while many review platforms encourage review solicitation, some sites, like Yelp, will shut it down if they detect anything fishy. Knowing the ins and outs is what it’s all about so you don’t get shut out of major platforms that can majorly impact your business. Good news! Pixaura's marketing masters already know all of the nitty gritty and will do this for you.
The Right Review Sites
But wait, it’s not just about the number of positive reviews or your star rating. You want your business to appear on review sites that are most impactful for your industry. If you are a local business like a restaurant you obviously need to be on Yelp. If you’re a wedding planner, you better make sure that you’re showing up on The Knot. Did you know that some websites hoard reviews for their site alone, while other sites allow search engines to tap into the data? This may leave your head spinning, but you can rest easy knowing Pixaura's pros will make sure you’re showing up in the right places and maximize your online reviews.
The Cost of Negative Reviews
94% of consumers say an online review has convinced them to avoid a business, and 4 out of 5 consumers have changed their mind about using a business after reading a negative review. Statistics this close to 100% better be at the forefront of your business-managing mind. This much trust in online reviews means those negative reviews are costing you when they go unaddressed. 
Keeping tabs on all of these reviews may seem like a handful but it’s an unavoidable part of running a business. Negative reviews should be acknowledged and addressed to combat their negative influence. When a business is flawlessly handling a complaint it goes a long way toward building a relationship of authenticity with the consumer and encouraging use despite the negative review. Internally, don’t let negative reviews rile you up - use them as a jumping off point to discuss improvements. 
We bet you never thought online reviews were this important. With everything else that goes into running a business your online management may be taking a back seat. This is a fatal mistake. You’re worrying about inventory, staffing, costs, ROI, product development and all of the tough stuff that comes with being a badass business owner, but dedicating some of your resources to online reputation management will pay off, big time.

Do You Need A Professional Website Designer? Absolutely.
There is no shortage of services that let you drag and drop a website to your heart’s content. But what are you missing out on that professional website design can give you? We’re letting you in on three advantages when you work with a web development pro.
SEO
Sure, you can design a pretty DIY website. But have you thought about the back end work that makes your website more visible to search engines? It’s all about beating the competition and if you’re missing even one aspect of SEO (search engine optimization,) you’re basically invisible to Google. Are you meeting all of the HTML code and search engine success factors? If this sounds like a foreign language to you, you’re doing it wrong. Your on-page SEO fundamentals need to be up to snuff because this affects how search engines crawl and index your page. You definitely don't want to get lost in the Google shuffle. Our website design experts take care of the nitty gritty for you.
Custom Design
Anyone can choose a template but is it going to serve your business goals? Are you encouraging online sales, lead generation or event attendance? A professional design agency creates custom, high quality solutions to meet your brand’s goals. Break out of the template box with custom graphics and text formats and get more customers. Also, an agency (*cough*, Pixaura) has the added benefit of working with a huge number of clients and seeing what works and what doesn’t in a wide range of industries. Let that expertise work for you.
Website Maintenance
Regardless of what many people think, a website is never finished. To stay relevant, copy and content must be updated regularly. Google wants to see new and authentic content added regularly and with that added content, it must be optimized to be used to your advantage. Additionally, technology is ever-changing and using a professional means that they keep your website up to date and running quickly and smoothly through any technological changes taking place.
You may be tempted to give Squarespace a shot, but as your business grows you will undoubtedly need a professional website. Look like a pro from the beginning and get your business off to a running start with a well-designed site from an award winning design company.

Spreading Digital Marketing Skills and Inspiration
We’re not just guiding your business’s digital success. We're also inspiring the next generation of developers and digital marketers. Kristina Darling, our own Director of Brand Strategy, spent her Friday afternoon talking to the fifth graders of Whitaker Elementary School. During their annual career fair, Kristina spread some “Pixie-aura” dust and spoke about her experience in the world of digital marketing. 
Kristina doled out inspiration, displaying the uniform of a digital marketer (athleisure wear for most of us, but much more stylish duds for this in-house marketing fashionista.) Adhering to the schools mission, “to foster academic and social growth for each student in a safe &amp; supportive school environment," Kristina answered any and all questions related to digital strategy. This was her third year participating at the school's career fair. (And she's already said she'll go back next year!)
“I love seeing that spark when I expose students to a career they have never even heard of. Honestly, I truly love what I do and I love being able to pass some of that passion on to the community's youth. And they had some many questions - I was really excited! I wasn't sure if they'd think it was cool just because I do! Ha! The business world continues to move into the digital landscape, and these types of careers can really be important. For me, I thought it was a great opportunity share that.”
Pixaura shares Kristina’s passion for our work. And we think she’s super rad for sharing that knowledge with Cincinnati Youth. Above all, creating successful digital strategies while having fun doing it, is what we’re about. We hope that was passed on to the fifth graders at Whitaker Elementary.

# Drop These Phrases From Your Marketing

How to Write Effective Marketing Content
If I never read “tribe” or “all the feels” in any marketing content again, it will be the best day of my life. Maybe not the best but definitely one of the top ten. Aside from my personal opinion, when it comes to writing effective marketing content for your product or services, cutting the fluff can have a colossal impact.
Short &amp; Simple
Repeat the words “concise” and “clear” to yourself over and over when drafting copy. This should be your mantra when it comes to digital content. Creating a piece of content like you're trying to meet a word count quota is difficult to read. If it bores your consumer, it pushes them to other sites. Ask yourself, do I need this phrase or am I reverting back to my high school English days? Let’s look at some phrases and words that you can remove to improve your content.


 I think


You’re a writer. You’re a professional. It’s time to stand behind your ideas and not second guess your expertise with this timid and self- deprecating phrase. 
Example:
I think writing marketing content is the bee's knees.
Writing marketing content is the bee's knees.


 Perhaps/Maybe/Simply


Toss these modifiers and use clear, assertive phrases for more impact.
Example:
Perhaps, removing fluff words improves writing.
Removing fluff words improves writing.


 So


This little guy is often used as a sad transition of ideas. Delete it and you’ll find that your sentence still communicates effectively without the useless word.
Example:
So contact us for effective digital marketing
Contact us for effective digital marketing


 Very


Nothing will degrade the quality of your writing like throwing in this offensive adverb. You’re better than this. Take out the “very” and the verb, and instead use a new descriptor word.
Example: 
Margot does very good work.
Margot is a genius.


 Often


This weak descriptor not only sounds generic but tells the consumer nothing. Quantify your idea and you’ll provide clarity.
Example:
We often see clients making this mistake.
Clients make this mistake weekly.


 Thing


Using “thing” in place of an actual idea is a rookie move. Expand on your idea with a thoughtful word in its place.
Example:
Pride in a well-drafted Google Ad is a thing we can all relate to.
A well-drafted Google Ad is pure bliss.
Bottom line, you’ve got great ideas. Successfully communicating them to a consumer can be tough. Follow these guidelines for effective marketing content or let Pixaura do the heavy lifting for you. It’s what we do. Contact us today!

# Google Local Service Ads: What to Know

Don't miss out on prestigious real estate: Google Local Service Ads.
What It Is and Why It’s Awesome
If you have the chance to appear above Google AdWords, the map 3-pack and the top organic SERPs (search engine results pages), why wouldn’t you? Are you drooling over this prime position yet? You should be and you should be taking advantage of Google Local Service Ads. 

When specific keywords are targeted during a search, Google Local Service Ads appear at the top of the page, enticing users to click on these first. Working in the consumer’s favor, the businesses in the ads have already been vetted for proper licensing and background checks. Even cooler, the Google Guarantee is offering to cover claims up to $2,000 if the consumer isn’t satisfied. With all of these perks, why wouldn’t a local service ad be a consumer’s first click? Forget your Instagram blue check mark, a Google Guarantee green check means lead conversions for your business.
How Google Local Service Ads Works For Businesses
Local Service Ads offer the same flexibility of AdWords meaning you set a weekly budget and you pay per lead. While this is a great feature to stay within budget, it can be anxiety-provoking when deciding how much to spend. How much should you budget? You don’t want to overspend and waste money, but you don’t want to underspend and lose out on leads. Fear not! Our digital marketing experts make sure that it is a stress-free and effective experience for your business. We guide you through setting a budget that is within your financial goals as well as effective for the level of competition of the industry that you’re in. 

There’s no cost to enroll. Woohoo! Because of proof of licensing and employee background checks, setup can be cumbersome but once you earn that green checkmark and the leads start rolling in, it’s worth it. When thinking about the Google real estate you’re occupying and the relatively low cost for leads, Google Local Service Ads are a no brainer. No set-up fees and no penalties for stopping. If it is a good fit for your industry you can’t go wrong. 
Limitations
Currently, Local Service Ads are only letting you display your basic company info, and a phone number to contact. No website link. If someone does want to check out a website before they book, and your website is not one of the top organic search results they may turn to a different business that is. Consumers don’t want to work. They want their results yesterday. This is why both SEO (search engine optimization) and paid ads are important. Luckily, we specialize in both. We understand the digital landscape and offer you every avenue possible to bring in the consumers you’re working so hard for, including Google Local Service Ads.

Even though Google Local Service Ads mean that you can show up above AdWords and the 3-pack, if there is a ton of competition in your service area your Local Service Ad still needs to rank higher than your competition. That is where our expertise comes in. We make sure that you’re meeting the criteria to show up before the rest.

Google Local Service Ads are currently only available for local businesses in a select number of industries. The list started off small but is ever-expanding. Currently, ads are available for anyone from an air duct cleaner and electrician to an event planner and tutor. Check your eligibility to see if you fit into one of the approved categories. 
Extras
Though Google Local Service Ads don’t give a lot of leeway for business information it does allow you to differentiate your business in a few ways such as adding “locally owned &amp; operated” and “offers military discounts.” Our SEM (search engine marketing) pros make sure you’re taking advantage of the extras and pull ahead of the competition. 

One thing Google Local Service Ads does do is allow you to highlight your reviews. Reviews build trust among consumers and Local Service Ads means another place to display your awesomeness and attract customers. We help you use this to your advantage.
Final Thoughts
Successful SEM is taking full advantage of channels that make sense for your brand and wringing out every advantage possible in each to bring you to the forefront of your industry. We tease out and customize a plan for your company specifically. If there is one more spot to take advantage of and give your business exposure, then that’s what we do. Google Local Service Ads may be that avenue. Contact us to learn more.

We are Calling Out the Top Three SEO Mistakes We See Clients Making


Not everyone is an SEO master, and we don’t expect you to be. That’s what we’re here for. We're tackling the top three SEO problems we see and explaining why they are common issues.



Waiting Until After Your Website is Built



Many businesses make the mistake of building their website and THEN deciding it’s time to work on SEO. Hire the right team from the beginning to build your website, and save time and money. The right team will not only build you a killer website but knows their SEO game as well. Hey, we know a few of those people. Implementing SEO protocols after your website is built can be time-consuming. Instead, work with a digital marketing company well-versed in both website construction and SEO. This will not only save you time and money but get your business off to a running start with web pages that are fast and mobile friendly.



It’s About Tricks



If you’re just diving into SEO it can seem like it is all a gimmick. In truth, if this is how your marketers are approaching it, they’re doing it wrong. Search engines are constantly adjusting how they rank websites to bring users the most genuine and relevant results. They consistently tinker with their SERPs (search engine result pages) to spit out websites that are authentically promoting their business. In this day and age, trying to trick a search engine is an amateur move of the past (remember keyword stuffing?) If your digital marketing team knows what they are doing they will be working on using keywords when it makes sense, creating unique and relevant content, consistently adding new content and addressing the technical aspects of your website to improve SEO.



Anyone Can do SEO



Sure, you can take an afternoon and learn about SEO, but along with the copy, title tags, and meta descriptions, there are technical facets that you may not be able to execute, like optimizing internal links, structured data and site speed. It takes experience to develop a custom strategy and to realize SEO problems are not solved with a one size fits all process. What works for one client does not necessarily work for another. You want an expert team taking time to look at your brand, how it relates to your SEO, and streamlining it all to make sure that what you’re doing equals sales. A high Google ranking does not mean sales, and an experienced digital marketing team knows this. We help you tease out how to rank high and see sales.

Myth Busted: Digital Marketing Is Only About Numbers
When it comes to digital marketing myths, it used to be "all about the numbers." If your traffic and social media Likes didn’t go up, you were failing. Today, your digital marketers should be taking a more sophisticated look at your digital strategy. Numbers give us clues into what is working what isn't, but it certainly isn’t the end-all-be-all of measuring a successful strategy. If your current agency is only looking at numbers, it may be time to look for another digital marketing company. 
It’s All About The Benjamins 
It’s time to step away from the emotional attachment you have to social posts. When consumers interact with your content it makes you feel great! You’ve done it! You’ve created meaningful and attractive content that caused someone to actually pause in their busy life and engage. That is no small feat and you deserve a pat on the back, but just because your audience is interacting with your posts it doesn’t necessarily mean that these actions are turning into revenue. While engagement can give you a general temperature of the digital marketing strategy, your bottom line is the only thing that can truly tell you if you need to switch it up. You may have a lot of super fans of your high-end product, but that doesn’t mean you’re reaching an audience who will drop the cash to purchase. If your revenue is increasing then that probably means you’re targeting the right audience.
Interests Change
People cycle through their likes and interests. Maybe a person in their 20’s is engaging with your liquor brand regularly, but as they age they may have kids or health issues and their focus shifts, which means that you may lose an engaged consumer. Even though you lost a consumer, chances are that you’ve gained a new generation of twenty-somethings. Your numbers have stayed the same, but your marketing strategy is still successful and reaching your target audience. This happens on a larger scale all of the time, which is why it is important to not base your value solely on a never-ending push for more fans.
You Want a Cadillac Not a Pinto When It Comes To Traffic
The over-importance of website traffic was one of the biggest digital marketing myths. If you were driving traffic, then you were doing your job. The problem is that traffic does not equal sales. Is your marketing agency taking a look at where you’re losing customers? Are they dipping out when they get to your “About” page? Or when they check out your prices? Taking a deeper look can give you more answers. Your digital marketing company may be doing a great job increasing your website traffic, but unless you’re seeing conversions and sales, they are failing in some way. It’s not enough to measure traffic, the right kind of traffic needs to be cruising through your site.
You’re Not Going to See Organic Growth From Social Media
The social media environment has changed. Algorithm changes are working against business and marketers. In a push to allow users to see less business content, business posts have all but disappeared from news feeds. Unless you’re paying for ads you’re not going to see huge results like you would in the good old days. Does that mean that you should scrap your social strategy? Not at all. It is important to be present on all platforms so that when consumers go looking, they can easily find you and see that you are present, relevant, active and easily reached. There are of course certain cases where tracking social media metrics is valuable, like a new brand or if you’re paying for ads. However, you’re not going to see organic social media growth anymore, and this is going to sound shocking, but it’s worth exploring if this is a metric you want to spend much time on. 
The game has evolved, and digital marketing myths have been exposed. Consumers want to interact with brands on an intimate and authentic level. It’s not solely about metrics and growth anymore, your digital marketing team should be invested and taking a deeper look at your strategy and ROI to be impactful.

We have Pi to 1 million places.



Also, we are publishing this post at 3:14 am on 3/14/19.



A few more tidbits about pi and Pi Day:



-- Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. However, it's not equal to the ratio of any two whole numbers, just an approximation. 



-- 22/7 -- is used in many calculations.



-- Pi is essential in architecture and construction. Also, it was used frequently by early astronomers.



-- Pi has been known for about 4,000 years. But it started to be called by the Greek letter only in the 1700s.



-- There are no occurrences of the sequence 123456 in the first million digits of pi .



-- The true "randomness" of pi's digits -- 3.14 and so on -- has never been proven.



-- Pi Day started 28 years ago at San Francisco's Exploratorium. Physicist Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, started celebrating pi on March 14, 1988, primarily with museum staffers. Since then, the tradition has grown to embrace math enthusiasts from all walks of life.



-- March 14 also happens to be Albert Einstein's birthday.



Yes, we recommend you indulge in an apple pie today.







Or, if you're in OTR, stop by our neighbor A Tavola and grab a wood fired pizza pie.

We have officially put Wonder Wednesday on our calendar. And you should too! 



In addition to being a great songwriter, Stevie was an early adopter of technology in his music. (Just like Pixaura is an early adopter of technology and the internets.) For instance, Stevie and others like the Beatles brought the Moog synthesizer into pop-music.



"Really, it's a wonder how anyone can tell Stevie and Pixaura apart."  -Zach




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ul7X5js1vE
"Superstition" Live on Sesame Street



Blind since shortly after birth, Stevie's prodigious talents were clear from a young age. He released his first album at age 11 - for the Motown label, no less! In addition to being a musical genius, Stevie regularly used his platform to speak out on the important social issues of his day. His story of overcoming the odds is an inspiration to us. 



"This song has tested positive for excessive levels of funk." - Ricky El Diablo 



In conclusion - we agree! :)

# Four Reasons Your Brand Needs a Facebook Group

Posts from your favorite Facebook business pages are dwindling on your newsfeed. It has left you wondering, is anyone seeing my business page posts? The hard truth is...probably not. At the beginning of 2018, Facebook altered its algorithm to promote more “meaningful social interactions,” leaving many business pages in the dust. It’s hard for businesses to stay relevant enough for users to see their updates. One thing that is apparent? Facebook groups seem to be getting all the love when it comes to newsfeed real estate. As a business owner, you’re probably wondering what to do.



Facebook Page or Facebook Group?



Or both?



You may be ready to throw in the towel when it comes to your business page, but hold onto it. While your posts may not be getting as much exposure, a business page is non-negotiable. When people are searching for your brand on Facebook, you need to show up. A business page not only presents you as a legitimate business but allows you to post information and links that group pages do not. This means people can quickly get hours, contact information, your website link, and more. This is also a point of contact if a consumer is trying to reach you. They will be searching for your business page, not your group.



While your group posts are going to show up in newsfeeds, this is only true for people who are already in your group. Chances are you have more people that "Like" your business page than members of your group. We can’t forget all of the old OGs out there who haven't quite grasped the concept of a Facebook group. They are an important part of the equation for a lot of businesses. If you want to do a live video, you’ll want to do it where the most people are going to see it - your Facebook business page. 



Facebook Ads



Facebook paid advertising can get you more Likes and followers. While groups have become an integral part of your social media marketing plan, only posts from your business page can be boosted. Another key reason to keep your Facebook business page relevant.



There is no doubt that Facebook groups make your consumers feel special and add another level to your consumer connection. A group is a place where we can interact with consumers and fans at a deeper level. Once your consumer is in your group, get ready to show up all over their newsfeed. Tout your group as a place for insider info, tips, sales, and juicy extras. 



If you're curious how to create a Facebook group, invite fans to join your group, set admins and moderators and more, check out these helpful tips from Facebook themselves.



The end game is to turn fans into sales. Utilizing both Facebook business pages and groups means you’re reaching the widest audience possible and staying relevant in the competitive real estate of the Facebook newsfeed.

We helped create the Procter &amp; Gamble annual report, and we feel very fortunate to be involved with this project. This was our third time contributing to the report with Madison Design Group.



We kicked off the process last week, and it's amazing how many voices are included in the Annual Report. Jennifer Corso spearheaded the project. She is P&amp;G's Director of Corporate Communications. And her level of organization is incredible! It is no easy task getting all of the team members at the table. In addition, there's a difficult and demanding timeline to navigate. 



In my opinion, this is high-stakes corporate project management at its finest. To start, the first meeting included members from several internal P&amp;G departments. On the other hand, Madison Design and Pixaura handled the design as external agencies. All team members involved had input. After that, Madison performed the magic of taking David Taylor's vision and the team's contributions and turning it into the Annual Report. In short, it is quite an impressive feat of strategy, organization, and execution. In conclusion, it's an honor for us to have a seat at this table. And I'm looking forward to Pixaura developing the 2019 Procter &amp; Gamble Interactive Annual Report.

Businesses seem to be baffled when it comes to Instagram. Many don’t utilize it, or brands make the attempt only to fizzle out after a few months. Instagram is vital to your business. We take a look at three three head Instagram challenges businesses face and how to address them.



It’s a new way to do social



Facebook was the guinea pig of social media platforms. The first mainstream platform to take off, people utilize it differently than other heavily used social platforms today. Now users are interacting with social platforms in a more restrained way, picking and choosing what is posted. 



Instagram is no different, and as a business you want to be posting content that is captivating and unique. The Facebook approach to social marketing works for businesses...on Facebook. They aren't seen as pushy or overwhelming because newsfeeds are already flooded with posts. Approaching Instagram, however, as a business can seem daunting. How do you stay relevant without seeming obnoxious? It’s time to pare down the posts and put thought into what you’re posting. 



But, if you’re selling toilet bowl cleaner, what kind of authentic, inspiring posts can you actually cultivate? The answer? Plenty. Find your unique spin on your product. Although Instagram can come across as artsy and soul-searching, don’t be scared of humor. Intimidation is the only thing holding you back.



But Facebook Has More Users



Facebook may still have more active users than instagram, but younger consumers are the powerhouse behind Instagram. As older generations fizzle out, we can predict longevity for Instagram. Ask any teenager and they’ll tell you, Facebook is for their grandparents. Take a look at the numbers, but know how to interpret them.



It’s Photo and Not Text Heavy



You’re used to typing out the details for every post on Facebook, some may not even have pictures. Get ready for a 180. Instagram is all about the visual content. You *literally* can’t post without something visual (except in your story). Take this opportunity to flex your creative muscles and have a little fun! Users don’t want to be bogged down with a lot of details in posts. If you have something profound to say, by all means type away, but when it comes to products and services most of the time you’ll want to keep it short and sweet. If users need more info, add a link in your bio. Instagram is about connecting with your users as a part of their lifestyle more than pushing details of your latest sale.



Does It Work for MY Business?



This is the biggy. Many business just have trouble seeing their brand on Instagram, especially if it doesn’t seem to fit the mold. Let us ease your mind, there is a place for every brand on Instagram. Pixaura will find a way through pictures and videos present your brand as authentic, relevant and vital to your consumer's lifestyle. Whether it be through humor, a humanitarian spin, touting you as the cutting edge brand that you are, we will make sure that you’re a relevant and engaging part of your fan's Instagram feed.



There are Instagram challenges, and there are Instagram opportunities. Learn how to address and take advantage of this platform! Or let the digital marketing experts at Pixaura do it for you.

Facebook ratings and reviews have changed, and now it's easier to find great businesses with recommendations. According to Facebook, 1 in 3 users are finding reviews and recommendations from the network, making the reviews section of your Facebook business page pretty important!



At this point, it's well established that reviews and recommendations are critical for a company's reputation. The aim of the new design is to provide easier ways for Facebook users to interact with local businesses. 



Basically, Facebook recommendations and reviews will be integrated in the new design, which is already rolling out. Let's take a look at the new process.



Facebook - Ratings are Now Recommendations



You no longer rate a business by providing a 1-5 star score. Instead, you just leave a positive or negative review. From there, Facebook interprets the score. That's it! It's similar to the changes Netflix made - only a thumbs up or down.



However, the binary nature of this "yes/no" choice lacks context, leaving some yearning for more. To many users, the sliding scale of 1 to 5 creates the more trust in a review. 



Customers no longer rate your business with a score range of 1-5



Today's customers rely heavily on online reviews from Facebook, as well as Google, Yelp, and several other platforms when making purchasing decisions. Drop us a line and we'll help you with your company's reviews and online reputation management.

What does CPM stand for in advertising?
CPM is shorthand for cost per thousand impressions and is a common measure of volume in advertising. Used by both marketers as a benchmarking metric when deciding their advertising budget and also media providers when evaluating the value of their users, CPM is the most frequent metric to determine relative pricing and costs of an advertising campaign across several mediums. The CPM calculator works in multiple ways, to calculate either the cost, CPM, or number of impressions.

How to calculate CPM?
The formula to calculate CPM is straightforward. Since CPM is used to determine the cost per thousand, in order to calculate it you simply divide the cost by the number of impressions divided by a thousand. Below is the CPM formula and the reversed equations:


  CPM = 1000 * Cost / Impressions
  Cost = CPM * Impressions / 1000
  Impressions = 1000 * Cost / CPM



Why is CPM an important metric?
Online advertising has the unique advantage of easily being able to analyze and measure results. The cost per thousand impressions is regarded as one of the most important metrics to determine if the price you are paying to show ads is cost-effective for your business.

A lower CPM means that your ad is being displayed to users at a relatively small cost, while a high CPM means that you’re paying more per view. Don’t mistake this with value, as typically lower CPM ad buyers are typically lower quality, making it up to you to decide what the right price is for your business.

What is the average CPM for each ad type?
CPMs can vary widely based on a number of factors with one of them being the type of ad you are trying to buy. It won’t cost you the same to deliver a small ad on a website compared to a large video that takes over the whole screen.

What’s the difference between CPM, CPC, and CPA?
Similar to CPM, CPC (Cost per click) and CPA (Cost per acquisition) are also common pricing types for online advertising.

CPC – Stands for Cost Per Click, meaning you pay for every time someone clicks on one of your ads. This can be very useful when promoting an specific product or service in a niche market and is regarded as less risky since you ensure users are taking action.

CPA – Stands for Cost Per Acquisition, meaning you only pay when a purchase is made as a result of a user clicking on the ad and purchasing your product. This is a great metric to track true return on ad spend since it reflects the actual revenue you are making back from advertising.

		[1]Industry Benchmarks
		These are preliminary estimates and are for illustration purposes only. We can't guarantee that these numbers will be achieved. Your numbers might be much better or worse depending on many factors. 		
		
		More research will be required as well as running actual campaigns to check actual numbers. Running the campaigns is the only way to provide real numbers.		
		
		We can not guarantee leads or sales. We can guarantee new visitors to your site that will evaluate your product/service and make the decision to buy or contact you.		
		
		Please keep in mind that landing page experience is important in the effectiveness of your PPC ads. Poor page experience = poor performing ads. 		
		
		The landing page must specifically address and solve the question that the client is asking. This is called Conversion Rate Optimization or CRO		
		
		So if you have a developer working on your site, we would also recommend asking him/her to improve your landing page. It is important.		
		
		If you don't have a developer on hand, Pixaura can help optimize your landing page for conversions.		
		
		
		
	
	
		
		
	
	
		Pay Per Click Definitions

		PPC - Pay Per Click. You only pay when someone clicks on your ad.
		
		CPC - Cost Per Click. The amount you pay when someone clicks on your ad.
		
		Impressions - The number of people that will see your ad.
		
		CTR - Click Through Rate. The percent of people seeing your ad that will click through to your content.
		
		Website Visits and Interactions - The number of people that clicked on your ad, liked it, or went to your website.
		
		CVR - Conversion Rate - The rate of visitors that convert into actual sales or leads.
		
		Leads/Sales/Inquiries - The number of sales, leads, or inquiries can you expect
		
		CPL - Cost Per Lead - How much did each sales, lead, or inquiry cost per
		
		Lead/Sales Value - Your estimated value for each lead or sale
		
		Potential ROI - Return on Ad Spend - Your Budget / CPL * Lead or Sales Value

Brand Discovery
Developing a successful digital strategy starts with getting to know you. Our discovery meetings allow us to fully understand your brand. If you do not have a marketing team, we become your marketing team. If you have a marketing team, we become a digital extension. We get to know your products, your voice, and your mission, expanding your success wherever we’re needed.

&nbsp;
Identify Objectives
First, define your business goals.

Every company’s goal is to be profitable. We will dig deeper to define your digital marketing goals. Maybe you want to increase online sales by 25%, aim for 100 social media shares, or increase your email subscription list by 500. Once you define your goals, prioritize them and take your top three. Now, ingrain them in your head because these goals will be the guide of your digital strategy.

&nbsp;
Define Channels
Omni-channel marketing may seem like the way to go, but the reality is that there are few businesses that actually need to use every digital marketing channel. If your business caters to adults that are over the age of 50, Snapchat doesn’t belong in your digital plans.

We define your key channels and trim the fat. Pixaura will reach your target audience more efficiently and cut unnecessary spending.

&nbsp;
Develop A  Content Strategy
According to Business2Community, brands now spend 25-43% of their marketing budget on content. Email marketing, blogs, visual content, social media posts, content is what the internet is built with and it should be the driving force of your digital strategy.

We pinpoint your audience’s wants and needs. Notice the same FAQs coming from your customers? We develop an email drip campaign that educates. Figured out that email isn’t the best channel for your target audience? We utilize other avenues like social or a business blog. Pixaura will create engaging content within the avenues handpicked for your brand. People share what they find interesting and the more they share, the closer you are to your digital goals.

&nbsp;
Create A Calendar
Once we’ve honed in on the type of content that will work for your brand, it’s time to create a timeline.

Juggling multiple content channels means this timeline acts as the lifeline of your digital strategy. We include details like content formats, deadlines, benchmarks, deliverables, and channels in your calendar. But don’t worry, we’ll do the juggling for you.

Keeping everything in one place helps simplify the process as your online presence explodes and your workload increases.

&nbsp;
Execute - Put Everything in Motion
The planning is done, and it’s time to put everything into motion.

As the digital marketing super team we’ve become up to this point, both Pixaura and the client will take a step back and take a look at the strategy we’ve created with a realistic mindset. We work with you to make sure you have enough resources, money and time to properly execute the items in your dream digital strategy. If you think you’re not fully equipped at the time, it’s perfectly fine to trim your list down a bit. Our goal is your success. If you feel you’re all set, let the fun begin.

&nbsp;
Monitor, Measure, &amp; Revise
All systems are go. The last step is monitoring and measuring the results of your digital strategy. We monitor each platform’s analytics, making tweaks to ensure home run results.

This is also the time when we work with you to check and balance those goals created in step #1 (identify objectives) and help you determine what was successful and what wasn’t. Successful digital transformation requires staying fluid to stay successful. As your business gains success and matures, so does your marketing plan.

And there you have it, 7 simple steps to build your digital strategy!
